It can affect the skin and internal organs. It's mainly seen in people with a poorly controlled or severe HIV infection. It can also affect some people who have a weakened immune system for another reason, as well as people who have a genetic vulnerability to the virus. See What causes Kaposi's sarcoma? for more information. Signs and symptoms The most common initial symptom is the appearance of small, painless, flat and discoloured patches on the skin or inside the mouth. They're usually red or purple and look similar to bruises. Over time, the patches may grow into lumps known as nodules and may merge into each other. Internal organs can also be affected, including the lymph nodes, lungs and the digestive system, which can cause symptoms such as: uncomfortable swelling in the arms or legs (lymphoedema) breathlessness, coughing up blood and chest pain nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhoea The rate at which symptoms progress depends on the type of Kaposi's sarcoma you have. Most types get worse quickly in a matter of weeks or months without treatment, but some progress very slowly over many years. When to seek medical advice You should see your GP if you have any worrying symptoms you think could be caused by Kaposi's sarcoma. If you have HIV, you can also contact your local HIV clinic if you have any concerns. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine your skin to look for the characteristic discoloured patches. If they suspect Kaposi's sarcoma, they will refer you for further tests to confirm the diagnosis. These tests may include: an HIV test \u2013 a blood test to confirm whether or not you have HIV (if you haven't already been diagnosed with the condition) a skin biopsy \u2013 where a small sample of cells is removed from an affected area of skin and checked for Kaposi's sarcoma cells an endoscopy \u2013 where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat to see if your lungs or digestive system are affected a computerised tomography (CT) scan to see if your lymph nodes or other parts of your body are affected What causes Kaposi's sarcoma? Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a virus called the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). This virus is thought to be spread during sex, through saliva, or from a mother to her baby during birth. HHV-8 is a relatively common virus and the vast majority of people who have it will not develop Kaposi's sarcoma. It only seems to cause cancer in some people with a weakened immune system and in some people who have a genetic vulnerability to the virus. A weakened immune system allows the HHV-8 virus to multiply to high levels in the blood, which increases the chance it will cause Kaposi's sarcoma. The virus appears to alter the genetic instructions that control cell growth. This means some cells reproduce uncontrollably and form lumps of tissue known as tumours. Types of Kaposi's sarcoma and their treatment There are four main types of Kaposi's sarcoma. These types affect different groups of people and are treated in different ways. HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma Although it's not as common as it used to be, Kaposi's sarcoma is still one of the main types of cancer to affect people with HIV.  HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma can progress very quickly if not treated. However, it can usually be controlled by taking HIV medication \u2013 known as combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) \u2013 to prevent HIV multiplying and allow the immune system to recover. The immune system can then reduce the levels of HHV-8 in the body. Read more about treating HIV. Some people may also require treatment with radiotherapy (where high-energy rays are used to destroy cancer cells) or chemotherapy (where powerful medications are used to destroy cancer cells), depending on the site and extent of the cancer and what symptoms it's causing. Classic Kaposi's sarcoma Classic Kaposi's sarcoma mainly affects middle-aged and elderly men of Mediterranean or Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Ashkenazi Jews are descended from Jewish communities that lived in central and eastern Europe. Most Jewish people in the UK are Ashkenazi Jews. It's thought people who develop classic Kaposi's sarcoma were born with a genetic vulnerability to the HHV-8 virus. Unlike the other types of Kaposi's sarcoma, the symptoms of classic Kaposi's sarcoma progress very slowly over many years and are usually limited to the skin. Immediate treatment isn't usually required because, in many cases, the condition doesn't affect life expectancy. You'll usually be monitored carefully and only treated if the symptoms get significantly worse. Radiotherapy is often used if treatment is required, although small skin patches or nodules may be removed using minor surgery or cryotherapy (freezing). Transplant-related Kaposi's sarcoma Transplant-related Kaposi's sarcoma is a rare complication of an organ transplant. It occurs because the immunosuppressant medication used to weaken the immune system and help prevent the body rejecting the new organ can allow a previous HHV-8 infection to reactivate, which means levels of the virus increase as it starts multiplying again. Transplant-related Kaposi's sarcoma can be aggressive and usually needs to be treated quickly. It's normally treated by reducing or stopping the immunosuppressants, if this is possible. If this is unsuccessful, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used. Endemic African Kaposi's sarcoma Endemic African Kaposi's sarcoma is common in parts of Africa and is one of the most widespread types of cancer in that region. Although this type of Kaposi's sarcoma is classified separately from HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma, many cases may actually result from an undiagnosed HIV infection. All suspected cases therefore must have an HIV test, as the most effective treatment in these cases is HIV medication. In cases not caused by HIV infection, this type of Kaposi's sarcoma may be the result of a genetic vulnerability to HHV-8. These cases are usually treated with chemotherapy, although sometimes radiotherapy may be used. Outlook With proper treatment, Kaposi's sarcoma can usually be controlled for many years. Deaths from the condition are uncommon in the UK. The discoloured patches of skin will often shrink and fade with treatment, although they may not ever disappear completely. A complete cure for any type of Kaposi's sarcoma isn't always possible, and there's a chance the condition could recur in the future. If you think this is happening, contact your HIV clinic, hospital specialist or GP as soon as possible.

It's also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. The characteristic symptoms are a high temperature that lasts for more than five days, with: a rash swollen glands in the neck dry, cracked lips red fingers or toes red eyes After a few weeks the symptoms become less severe, but may last longer. At this stage, the affected child may have peeling skin on their fingers and toes. Read more about the symptoms of Kawasaki disease. When to see your GP See your GP if your child is unwell and has the above symptoms. If your baby is less than six months old, you should be particularly cautious and see your GP as soon as possible. The symptoms of Kawasaki disease can be similar to those of other conditions that cause a fever in children. Kawasaki disease can't be prevented. However, most children make a full recovery within six to eight weeks if it's diagnosed and treated promptly. Read more about diagnosing Kawasaki disease. It's thought Kawasaki disease is caused by an infection, although the exact cause isn't fully understood. Read more about the possible causes of Kawasaki disease. Treating Kawasaki disease Kawasaki disease is usually treated in hospital as it can sometimes lead to serious complications. It's best if treatment begins as soon as possible, ideally within 10 days of the symptoms starting. The sooner treatment starts, the quicker the recovery time and the less risk there is of complications developing. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a solution of antibodies, and aspirin are the two main medicines used to treat Kawasaki disease. Read more about treating Kawasaki disease. Complications of Kawasaki disease Kawasaki disease causes the blood vessels to become inflamed and swollen, which can lead to complications in the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart (coronary arteries). Up to 5% of children with Kawasaki disease experience complications with their heart. Complications can be fatal in about 1% of cases. Because of this, the condition has become the leading cause of acquired heart disease \u2013 where the heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted \u2013 in the UK. Read more about the complications of Kawasaki disease. Who's affected? Around 8 in every 100,000 children develop Kawasaki disease in the UK each year. Research carried out in England from 1998 to 2003 found 72% of children with Kawasaki disease were under the age of five. The condition was also shown to be 1.5 times more common in boys than girls. Support The Kawasaki Support Group UK can provide you with additional information and advice about your child's condition. Information about your child If your child has been affected by Kawasaki disease, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

There's no cure for keratosis pilaris, but you may be able to improve the rash by using soap-free cleansers, moisturising and gently exfoliating (removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin). There's no real need to see your GP unless the condition is causing you concern. It usually improves as you get older and sometimes disappears completely in adulthood. This page provides more information on keratosis pilaris and explains what you can do if you have the condition. Where keratosis pilaris occurs Keratosis pilaris most commonly affects the back of the upper arms, and sometimes the buttocks and front of the thighs. Less often, the forearms and upper back may be affected. There are also rare variants of keratosis pilaris that can affect the eyebrows, face and scalp, or the entire body. How it affects the skin The patches of affected skin will be covered in tiny spiky bumps, which may be white, red or skin-coloured. This spotting looks like \"chicken skin\" or permanent goose pimples, and the skin feels rough, like sandpaper. In some people, the skin itches and there may be inflammation and pinkness around the bumps. Keratosis pilaris isn't contagious (it can't be spread from person to person). The skin tends to improve in summer and get worse during winter months or dry conditions. Who is affected Keratosis pilaris is very common, affecting up to one in three people in the UK. It can affect people of all ages, but it's particularly common in: children and adolescents females people with eczema or a condition called ichthyosis (thick, dry scaly skin) people of Celtic origin The condition typically starts during childhood (although it can sometimes occur in babies), and gets worse in adolescence, around puberty. Keratosis pilaris sometimes improves after puberty, and may even disappear in adulthood, although many adults still have the condition in their 40s and 50s. It's uncommon in elderly people. What causes keratosis pilaris? Keratosis pilaris runs in families and is inherited from your parents. If one parent has the condition, there's a one in two chance that any children they have will also inherit it. Keratosis pilaris occurs when too much keratin builds up in the skin's hair follicles. Keratin is a protein found in the tough outer layer of skin, which causes the surface of the skin to thicken (hence the name \"keratosis\"). The excess keratin blocks the hair follicles with plugs of hard, rough skin. The tiny plugs widen the pores, giving the skin a spotty appearance. It's often associated with other dry skin conditions, such as eczema and ichthyosis, which make the rash worse. Treating keratosis pilaris There's little that can be done to treat keratosis pilaris, and it often gets better on its own without treatment. However, if it's bothering you, the following measures may help improve your rash: Use non-soap cleansers rather than soap \u2013 ordinary soap may dry your skin out and make the condition worse. Moisturise your skin when it's dry \u2013 your GP or pharmacist can recommend a suitable cream. However, moisturisers and emollients only reduce the dryness of your skin and won't cure the rash. Creams containing salicylic acid, lactic acid or urea are thought to be the most effective. Gently rub the skin with an exfoliating foam pad or pumice stone to exfoliate the rough skin \u2013 be careful not to scrub too hard and rub off layers of skin. Take lukewarm showers rather than hot baths. You can also ask your GP about \"off-label\" treatments that may help. These are products that haven't been officially approved and licensed for treating keratosis pilaris, but are sometimes used because they've helped people in the past. Examples include: creams containing retinol (which is derived from vitamin A) chemical peels microdermabrasion \u2013 a cosmetic exfoliation treatment, which is sometimes offered in health spas There's no strong evidence to suggest that these therapies are effective treatments for keratosis pilaris. You may also have to pay for some of them privately. Page last reviewed: 15\/04\/2015 Next review due: 15\/04\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's caused by excess bilirubin damaging the brain or central nervous system. In newborn babies with very high levels of bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinaemia), the bilirubin can cross the thin layer of tissue that separates the brain and blood (the blood-brain barrier). The bilirubin can damage the brain and spinal cord, which can be life threatening. Brain damage caused by high levels of bilirubin is also called bilirubin encephalopathy. Your baby may be at risk of developing kernicterus if: they have a very high level of bilirubin in their blood the level of bilirubin in their blood is rising rapidly they don't receive any treatment Kernicterus is now extremely rare in the UK, affecting less than 1 in every 100,000 babies. Initial symptoms of kernicterus in babies include: decreased awareness of the world around them \u2013 for example, they may not react when you clap your hands in front of their face their muscles become unusually floppy, like a rag doll poor feeding As kernicterus progresses, additional symptoms can include seizures (fits) and arching of the neck or spine. Treatment for kernicterus involves using an exchange transfusion as used in the treatment of newborn jaundice. If significant brain damage occurs before treatment, a child can develop serious and permanent problems, such as: cerebral palsy \u2013 a condition that affects a child's movement and co-ordination hearing loss \u2013 which can range from mild to severe learning difficulties involuntary twitching of different parts of their body problems maintaining normal eye movements \u2013 people affected by kernicterus have a tendency to gaze upwards or from side to side rather than straight ahead poor development of the teeth Page last reviewed: 13\/10\/2015 Next review due: 13\/10\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Signs and symptoms of kidney cancer can include: blood in your urine  a constant pain in your side, just below the ribs a lump or swelling in the kidney area (on either side of the body) See your GP as soon as possible if you experience any of these symptoms. They will examine you and may refer you to a specialist clinic for further tests. In around half of all cases of kidney cancer there are no symptoms, and the condition is detected during tests for other unrelated conditions. Read more about the symptoms of kidney cancer and diagnosing kidney cancer. The kidneys and cancer The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs located on either side of the body, just underneath the ribcage. Their main role is to filter out waste products from the blood, in addition to producing urine. Only one of the kidneys is usually affected by cancer. The human body is made up of billions of cells, which normally grow and multiply in an orderly way, with new cells being created only when and where they're needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably. Exactly what triggers this growth is unknown; however, there are certain risk factors that can increase the chances of the condition developing, such as smoking and obesity. Kidney cancer most frequently affects people over 50 years of age and is more common among men. Read more about the causes of kidney cancer. Types of kidney cancer Many different types of cancer can affect the kidneys. The most common type is renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which accounts for more than 80% of all kidney cancers. Rarer types of kidney cancer include: transitional cell cancer \u2013 develops in the lining of the kidneys and usually affects men who are 50 years of age or over Wilms\u2019 tumour \u2013 a rare type of kidney cancer that affects children This topic focuses on RCC. See the Cancer Research UK website for more information about transitional cell cancer and Wilms\u2019 tumour. Treating kidney cancer The earlier kidney cancer is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat. How it's treated will depend on the size and spread of the cancer. Surgery to remove the cancerous cells is usually the first course of action. Unlike most other cancers, chemotherapy isn't very effective at treating kidney cancer. However, non-surgical treatments are available, such as radiotherapy or targeted therapies. These are most commonly used in the more advanced stages of kidney cancer, when the cancer has spread beyond the kidney. Read more about treating kidney cancer. Preventing kidney cancer As the causes of kidney cancer aren't fully understood, it's not possible to fully prevent it. However, leading a healthy lifestyle may reduce the chances of developing the condition. A combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise will help to avoid becoming overweight or obese, which is a significant risk factor for kidney cancer. If you're overweight or obese, you can lose weight and maintain a healthy weight by combining regular exercise with a calorie-controlled diet. Read more about treating obesity. Outlook The outlook for kidney cancer is usually good if the condition is diagnosed in its early stages, when the cancer is still contained inside the kidney. Kidney cancer can often be completely cured by removing some or all of the kidney. This is because it's possible to live a healthy life with only one kidney. Around one in three cases of kidney cancer are diagnosed at an early stage. Depending on how aggressive the cancer is, 65-90% of people will live at least five years after receiving an early diagnosis of kidney cancer, with many people living much longer. The outlook for kidney cancer that's spread outside the kidney is less favourable. Around 40-70% of people with this stage of kidney cancer will live at least five years after receiving a diagnosis. In cases where kidney cancer is advanced and has spread to other parts of the body, only around 10% of people will live for at least five years after receiving a diagnosis. What do our kidneys do?

It's a common condition often associated with getting older. Anyone can get it, although it's more common in black people and people of south Asian origin. CKD can get gradually worse over time and eventually the kidneys may stop working altogether, but this is uncommon. Many people with kidney disease are able to live long, largely normal lives. This page covers: Symptoms Causes Tests and diagnosis Treatments Outlook Symptoms of CKD There are usually no symptoms of kidney disease in the early stages. It may only be picked up if blood or urine tests carried out for another reason detect a possible problem with your kidneys. When it reaches a more advanced stage, symptoms can include: tiredness swollen ankles, feet or hands shortness of breath feeling sick blood in your urine See your GP if you have persistent or worrying symptoms that you think could be caused by kidney disease. Read more about the symptoms of CKD. Causes of CKD Kidney disease is usually caused by other conditions that put a strain on the kidneys. Often it's the result of a combination of different problems. CKD can be caused by: high blood pressure \u2013 over time, this can put strain on the small blood vessels in the kidneys and stop the kidneys working properly diabetes \u2013 too much glucose in your blood can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys high cholesterol \u2013 this can cause a build-up of fatty deposits in the blood vessels supplying your kidneys, which can make it harder for them to work properly kidney infections glomerulonephritis \u2013 kidney inflammation polycystic kidney disease \u2013 an inherited condition where growths called cysts develop in the kidneys blockages in the flow of urine \u2013 for example, from recurrent kidney stones or an enlarged prostate long-term, regular use of certain medicines \u2013 such as lithium and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) You can help prevent CKD by making healthy lifestyle changes and ensuring any underlying conditions you have are well controlled. Tests for CKD CKD can be diagnosed using blood and urine tests. These tests are used to look for high levels of certain substances in your blood and urine that are signs your kidneys aren't working properly. If you're at a high risk of developing kidney disease \u2013 for example, you have one of the conditions mentioned above \u2013 you may be advised to have regular tests to check for CKD so it's picked up at an early stage. The results of your blood and urine tests can be used to tell the stage of your kidney disease. This is a number that reflects how severe the damage to your kidneys is, with a higher number indicating more serious CKD. Read more about how CKD is diagnosed. Treatments for CKD There's no cure for CKD, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and stop it getting worse. Your treatment will depend on how severe your kidney disease is. The main treatments are: lifestyle changes to ensure you remain as healthy as possible medication to control associated problems such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol dialysis \u2013 treatment to replicate some of the kidney's functions; this may be necessary in advanced CKD kidney transplant \u2013 this may also be necessary in advanced CKD You'll also be advised to have regular check-ups to monitor your condition. Read more about how CKD is treated and living with CKD. Outlook for CKD CKD can range from a mild condition with no or few symptoms, to a very serious condition where the kidneys stop working, sometimes called kidney failure. Most people with CKD will be able to control their condition with medication and regular check-ups. CKD only progresses to kidney failure in around 1 in 50 people with the condition. But if you have CKD, even if it's mild, you're at an increased risk of developing other serious problems, such as cardiovascular disease. This is a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, which includes heart attacks and strokes. Cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of death in people with kidney disease, although healthy lifestyle changes and medication can help reduce your risk of developing it.

It often involves diverting blood to a machine to be cleaned. Normally, the kidneys filter the blood, removing harmful waste products and excess fluid and turning these into urine to be passed out of the body. Why do I need dialysis? If your kidneys aren't working properly, for example because you have advanced chronic kidney disease (kidney failure), the kidneys may not be able to clean the blood properly. Waste products and fluid can build up to dangerous levels in your body. Left untreated, this can cause a number of unpleasant symptoms and eventually be fatal. Dialysis filters out unwanted substances and fluids from the blood before this happens. How long will I need dialysis for? It depends. In some cases, kidney failure may be a temporary problem and dialysis can be stopped when your kidneys recover. But often, someone with kidney failure will need a kidney transplant. It's not always possible to carry out a kidney transplant straight away, so dialysis may be needed until a suitable donor kidney becomes available. If a kidney transplant isn't suitable for you, for example because you're not well enough to have a major operation, dialysis may be needed for the rest of your life. What happens during dialysis There are two main types of dialysis: haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Haemodialysis Haemodialysis is the most common type of dialysis and the one most people are aware of. During the procedure, a tube is attached to a needle in your arm. Blood passes along the tube and into an external machine that filters it, before it's passed back into the arm along another tube. This is usually carried out three days a week, with each session lasting around four hours. Peritoneal dialysis Peritoneal dialysis uses the inside lining of your abdomen (the peritoneum) as the filter, rather than a machine. Like the kidneys, the peritoneum contains thousands of tiny blood vessels, making it a useful filtering device. Before treatment starts, an incision is made near your belly button and a thin tube called a catheter is inserted through the incision and into the space inside your abdomen (the peritoneal cavity). This is left in place permanently. Fluid is pumped into the peritoneal cavity through the catheter. As blood passes through the blood vessels lining the peritoneal cavity, waste products and excess fluid are drawn out of the blood and into the dialysis fluid. The used fluid is drained into a bag a few hours later and replaced with fresh fluid. Changing the fluid usually takes about 30-40 minutes and normally needs to be repeated around four times a day. If you prefer, this can be done by a machine overnight while you sleep.   Read more about how dialysis is performed. Which type of dialysis is best? In many cases, you'll be able to choose which type of dialysis you want to have. The two techniques are equally effective for most people, but each has its own advantages and drawbacks. For example: haemodialysis means you'll have four treatment-free days a week, but the treatment sessions last longer and you may need to visit hospital each time peritoneal dialysis can be done quite easily at home and can sometimes be done while you sleep, but it needs to be done every day If you're able to choose the type of dialysis you prefer, your care team will discuss the pros and cons of each option with you to help you make a decision. Read more about the advantages and disadvantages of both types of dialysis. Side effects of dialysis Haemodialysis can cause itchy skin and muscle cramps. Peritoneal dialysis can put you at risk of developing peritonitis (infection of the thin membrane that surrounds your abdomen). Both types of dialysis can make you feel exhausted. Read more about the possible side effects of dialysis Life on dialysis Many people on dialysis have a good quality of life. If you're otherwise well, you should be able to: continue working or studying drive exercise go swimming go on holiday Most people can remain on dialysis for many years, although the treatment can only partially compensate for the loss of kidney function and having kidneys that don't work properly can place a significant strain on the body. Sadly, this means that people can die while on dialysis if they don't have a kidney transplant, particularly elderly people and those with other health problems. Someone who starts dialysis in their late 20s can expect to live for up to 20 years or longer, but adults over 75 may only survive for two to three years. However, it's important to be aware that survival rates of people on dialysis have improved over the past decade and are expected to continue improving in the future.

It can range from minor loss of kidney function to complete kidney failure. AKI normally happens as a complication of another serious illness. It's not the result of a physical blow to the kidneys, as the name might suggest. This type of kidney damage is usually seen in older people who are unwell with other conditions and the kidneys are also affected. Read more about who's at risk of AKI. It's essential that AKI is detected early and treated promptly. The role of the kidneys is to: filter \u2013 removing waste and water from the blood (as urine, via the bladder) clean the blood keep the bones healthy look after blood pressure stimulate the bone marrow to make blood Without quick treatment, abnormal levels of salts and chemicals can build up in the body, which affects the ability of other organs to work properly.  If the kidneys shut down completely, this may require temporary support from a dialysis machine, or lead to death. Symptoms of acute kidney injury In the early stages of AKI, there may not be any symptoms. The only possible warning sign may be that the person isn't producing much urine, although this isn't always the case. However, someone with AKI can deteriorate quickly and suddenly experience any of the following: nausea and vomiting dehydration confusion high blood pressure abdominal pain slight backache a build-up of fluid in the body (oedema) Even if it doesn't progress to complete kidney failure, AKI needs to be taken seriously. It has an effect on the whole body, changes how some drugs are handled by the body and could make some existing illnesses more serious. AKI is different to chronic kidney disease, where the kidneys gradually lose function over a long period of time. Who's at risk of acute kidney injury? You're more likely to get AKI if: you're aged 65 or over you already have a kidney problem, such as chronic kidney disease you have a long-term disease, such as heart failure, liver disease or diabetes you're dehydrated or unable to maintain your fluid intake independently you have a blockage in your urinary tract (or are at risk of this) you have a severe infection or sepsis you're taking certain medicines, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS, such as ibuprofen) or blood pressure drugs, such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics; diuretics are usually beneficial to the kidneys, but may become less helpful when a person is dehydrated or suffering from a severe illness you're given aminoglycosides \u2013 a type of antibiotic; again, this is only an issue if the person is dehydrated or ill, and these are usually only given in a hospital setting AKI is estimated to affect 13-18% of people admitted to hospital. It can affect both adults and children. Causes of acute kidney injury Most cases of AKI are caused by reduced blood flow to the kidneys, usually in someone who is already unwell with another health condition. This reduced blood flow could be caused by: low blood volume after bleeding, excessive vomiting or diarrhoea, or as seen with severe dehydration the heart pumping out less blood than normal as a result of heart failure, liver failure or sepsis, for example problems with the blood vessels \u2013 such as inflammation and blockage in the blood vessels within the kidneys (a rare condition called vasculitis) certain medicines (see above), which can affect the blood supply to the kidney \u2013 other medicines may cause unusual reactions in the kidney itself AKI can also be caused by a problem with the kidney itself, such as glomerulonephritis. This may be caused by a reaction to some drugs, infections or contrast medium (the liquid dye used in some types of X-rays). It may also be due to a blockage affecting the drainage of the kidneys, such as: an enlarged prostate a tumour in the pelvis \u2013 such as an ovarian or bladder tumour kidney stones When should AKI be suspected? A doctor may suspect AKI in people known to be at risk who suddenly fall ill or develop symptoms which suggest complications of AKI. AKI may also be suspected in people who have been unwell for a while and have either: chronic kidney disease  a urinary system disease new or worsening urinary symptoms symptoms or signs of a disease affecting the kidneys and other organs Diagnosing acute kidney injury AKI can be diagnosed after measuring urine output and doing blood tests. Blood levels of creatinine \u2013 a chemical waste product produced by the muscles \u2013 will be measured. Healthy kidneys filter creatinine and other waste products from the blood and these are excreted, in the form of urine. It's an easy and quick marker of kidney function, with higher levels of creatinine in the blood indicating poorer kidney function. In adults, a diagnosis of AKI can be made if: blood creatinine level has risen from the baseline value for that person (by 26 micromoles per litre or more within 48 hours) blood creatinine level has risen over time (by 50% or more within the past 7 days) they are passing much less urine (less than 0.5ml per kg per hour for more than 6 hours) In children and teenagers, doctors should use the plasma creatinine level to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). A diagnosis of AKI is made if they have a 25% or greater fall in eGFR within the past 7 days. Read more about AKI in children. Investigating the underlying cause Urine can be tested for protein, blood cells, sugar and waste products, which may give clues to the underlying cause. Doctors also need to know about: any other symptoms \u2013 such as signs of sepsis or signs of heart failure any other medical conditions any medication that's been taken in the past week \u2013 as some medicines can cause AKI An ultrasound scan should reveal if the cause is a blockage in the urinary system, such as an enlarged prostate or bladder tumour. Treating acute kidney injury Treatment of AKI depends on the underlying cause and extent of illness. In most cases, treating the underlying problem will cure the AKI. GPs may be able to manage mild cases in people who aren't already in hospital. They may: advise stopping any medication that may be causing the situation, or making it worse \u2013 it may be safe to resume some of these when the problem is sorted treat any underlying infections advise on fluid intake to prevent dehydration (which could cause or worsen AKI) take blood tests to monitor levels of creatinine and salt \u2013 to check how well a person is recovering refer to a urologist (genitourinary surgeon) or nephrologist (kidney specialist) if the cause isn't clear or if a more serious cause is suspected Admission to hospital is necessary in cases where: there's an underlying cause that needs urgent treatment \u2013 such as a urinary blockage, or if the person is seriously unwell; most people need hospital care to treat the underlying cause, allowing the AKI to get better there's a risk of urinary blockage \u2013 because of prostate disease, for example the person's condition has deteriorated, and regular blood and urine tests are needed to monitor how well their kidneys are working the person has a complication of AKI The majority of people who recover from AKI end up with a very similar level of kidney function as they had before they became ill, or go on to have normal kidney function.   However, some people go on to develop chronic kidney disease or long-term kidney failure as a result. In severe cases, dialysis \u2013 where a machine filters the blood to rid the body of harmful waste, extra salt and water \u2013 may be needed. Preventing acute kidney injury Those at risk of AKI should be monitored with regular blood tests if they become unwell or start new medication. It's also useful to check how much urine you're passing. Any warning signs of AKI, such as vomiting or producing little urine, require immediate investigation for AKI and treatment. People who are dehydrated, or at risk of dehydration, may need to be given fluids via a drip. Any medicine that seems to be making the problem worse, or directly damaging the kidneys needs to be stopped, at least temporarily. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced detailed guidelines on preventing, detecting and managing AKI. Read the NICE guidelines here. Complications of acute kidney injury The most serious complications of acute kidney injury are: high levels of potassium in the blood \u2013 in severe cases, this can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and heart rhythm problems fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) acidic blood (metabolic acidosis) \u2013 which can cause nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and breathlessness Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 11\/04\/2016 Next review due: 11\/04\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's more serious than cystitis, a common infection of the bladder that makes urinating painful. If treated promptly, a kidney infection doesn't cause serious harm, but will make you feel very unwell. If a kidney infection isn't treated, it can get worse and cause permanent kidney damage. Symptoms of a kidney infection often come on within a few hours. You can feel feverish, shivery, sick and have a pain in your back or side. Read more about the symptoms of a kidney infection. When to see your GP See your GP if you have a fever and persistent tummy, lower back or genital pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination. Most kidney infections need prompt treatment with antibiotics to stop the infection from damaging the kidneys or spreading to the bloodstream. You may also need painkillers. If you're especially vulnerable to the effects of an infection \u2013 for example, if you have a pre-existing health condition or are pregnant, you may be admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotics through an intravenous drip. After taking antibiotics, you should feel completely better after about two weeks. In rare cases, a kidney infection can cause further problems. These include blood poisoning (sepsis) and a build-up of pus in the kidney called an abscess. Read more about treating a kidney infection and the complications of a kidney infection. What causes a kidney infection? A kidney infection usually happens when bacteria \u2013 often a type called E. coli \u2013 gets into the urethra (the tube which carries urine out of the body) and travels up through the bladder and into the kidneys. Read more about the causes of a kidney infection. Who's at risk? Kidney infections are relatively rare. It's estimated that one in every 830 people develops a kidney infection each year in the UK. They can happen at any age, but are much more common in women. In fact, women are six times more likely to get a kidney infection than men. This is because a woman's urethra is shorter, making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys. Younger women are most at risk because they tend to be more sexually active, and having frequent sex increases the chances of getting a kidney infection. Younger children are also vulnerable to developing kidney infections because they may be born with an abnormality of the urinary tract or have a condition called vesico-ureteric reflux, where there is a backflow of urine from the bladder up to the kidneys. Can kidney infections be prevented? You can reduce your chances of developing a kidney infection by keeping your bladder and urethra free from bacteria. This can include drinking plenty of fluids, keeping your genitals clean and treating any constipation. Read more about preventing a kidney infection.

They're quite common, with around three in 20 men and up to two in 20 women developing them at some stage of their lives.  The medical term for kidney stones is nephrolithiasis, and if they cause severe pain it's known as renal colic. Symptoms of kidney stones Small kidney stones may go undetected and be passed out painlessly in the urine. But it's fairly common for a stone to block part of the urinary system, such as the: ureter \u2013 the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder urethra \u2013 the tube urine passes through on its way out of the body A blockage can cause severe pain in the abdomen or groin and sometimes causes a urinary tract infection (UTI). Read more about the symptoms of kidney stones. What causes kidney stones? The waste products in the blood can occasionally form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. Over time, the crystals may build up to form a hard stone-like lump. This is more likely to happen if you don't drink enough fluids, if you're taking some types of medication, or if you have a medical condition that raises the levels of certain substances in your urine. Read more about the causes of kidney stones. After a kidney stone has formed, your body will try to pass it out when you go to the toilet (in the urine). This means it will often travel through the urinary system (the kidneys, kidney tubes and bladder). Treating and preventing kidney stones Most kidney stones are small enough to be passed in your urine, and it may be possible to treat the symptoms at home with medication. Larger stones may need to be broken up using ultrasound or laser energy. Occasionally, keyhole surgery may be needed to remove very large kidney stones directly. Read more about treating kidney stones. It's estimated that up to half of all people who have had kidney stones will experience them again within the following five years. To avoid getting kidney stones, make sure you drink plenty of water every day so you don't become dehydrated. It's very important to keep your urine diluted (clear) to prevent waste products forming into kidney stones. Read more about preventing kidney stones. The kidneys The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs that are roughly 10cm (four inches) in length. They're located towards the back of the abdomen on either side of the spine. The kidneys remove waste products from the blood. The clean blood is then transferred back into the body and the waste products are passed out of the body in your urine when you go to the toilet.

If the kidneys lose this ability, waste products can build up, which is potentially life-threatening. This loss of kidney function, known as end-stage chronic kidney disease or kidney failure, is the most common reason for needing a kidney transplant. It's possible to partially replicate the functions of the kidney using a blood filtering procedure known as dialysis. However, this can be inconvenient and time-consuming, so a kidney transplant is the treatment of choice for kidney failure whenever possible. Who can have a kidney transplant? Most people who need a kidney transplant are able to have one, regardless of their age, as long as: they're well enough to withstand the effects of surgery the transplant has a relatively good chance of success the person is willing to comply with the recommended treatments required after the transplant \u2013 such as taking immunosuppressant medication and attending regular follow-up appointments Reasons why it may not be safe or effective to perform a transplant include having an ongoing infection (this will need to be treated first), severe heart disease, cancer that has spread to several places in your body, or AIDS. Around one in three people with kidney failure is suitable for a transplant. Kidney donations Unlike many other types of organ donation, it's possible to donate a kidney while you're alive because you only need one kidney to survive. This is known as a living donation. People who want to be considered as a kidney donor are tested very carefully to ensure they are a suitable donor and are fit for the operation needed to remove a kidney. Ideally, living donations will come from a close relative because they are more likely to share the same tissue type and blood group as the recipient, which reduces the risk of the body rejecting the kidney. Kidney donations are also possible from people who have recently died. This is known as deceased kidney donation. However, this type of kidney donation has a slightly lower chance of long-term success. Read more about donating a kidney. Waiting for a kidney People who need a kidney transplant, but don't have a suitable living donor, will have to wait until a suitable deceased donor kidney becomes available. On average, the waiting time for a deceased donor kidney transplant is two to three years. Waiting times are so long because the demand for donated kidneys in the UK is far higher than the available supply of donors. From April 2014 to April 2015, around 3,000 kidney transplants were carried out in the UK, but there were still more than 5,000 people on the waiting list for a kidney by the end of this period. Kidney donors are particularly required from people of non-white ethnic origin, because rates of kidney disease are especially high in people of South Asian, African and Caribbean ethnic origin. However, there are not many donors from these communities. Read more about the kidney transplant waiting list. The transplant procedure If you receive a kidney from a living donor, this will be a carefully planned operation. If you're waiting for a deceased donor kidney, the transplant centre will contact you when a suitable kidney becomes available. This can happen at any time of the day or night. Staff at the centre will check you don't have any new medical problems and will ask you to go to the centre, where final checks will be performed to be sure the transplant should go ahead. You'll then have surgery to insert the new kidney and connect it to your blood vessels and bladder. The new kidney will be placed in the lower part of your abdomen (tummy). Your own kidneys will usually be left in place. A kidney transplant is a major surgical procedure with a wide range of potential risks. In the short term, these risks include blood clots and infection. Longer-term problems, which include diabetes and an increased risk of infections, are usually related to the medication you need to take to reduce the chance of rejection. Because of the risk of further problems, people who have had a kidney transplant require regular check-ups for the rest of their life. Read more about what happens during a kidney transplant and the risks of a kidney transplant. Living with a kidney transplant Having a healthy lifestyle after a kidney transplant goes a long way to minimise the risk of complications. Therefore, it\u2019s recommended that you: stop smoking if you smoke eat a healthy diet lose weight if you are overweight or obese take steps to reduce your risk of developing infections Read more about living with a transplant. How long do kidney transplants last? There are a number of factors which affect how long a transplanted kidney lasts. These include whether or not the kidney came from a living donor, how well the kidney is matched in terms of blood group and tissue type, and the age and overall health of the person receiving the donation. Overall, average kidney survival times are: 1 year \u2013 about 95% 5 years \u2013 about 85-90% 10 years \u2013 about 75% If you have a kidney transplant that fails, you can usually be put on the waiting list for another transplant. You may need dialysis in the meantime. The NHS Organ Donor Register In the UK, consent is required before organs can be donated. A person can give their consent to become an organ donor after death by joining the NHS Organ Donor Register or by discussing their wishes with loved ones. Alternatively, a person's organs can be donated if consent is obtained after their death from an authorised person, such as a relative or friend. Joining the NHS Organ Donor Register is quick and simple, and will only take a few minutes of your time. You can remove yourself from the register at any time, and you can specify what you're willing to donate. Read more about organ donation.

Chromosomes are packages of genes found in every cell in the body. Two types of chromosome, called the sex chromosomes, determine the genetic sex of a baby. These are named either X or Y. Usually, a female baby has two X chromosomes (XX) and a male has one X and one Y (XY). But in Klinefelter syndrome, a boy is born with an extra copy of the X chromosome (XXY). The X chromosome is not a \"female\" chromosome and is present in everyone. The presence of a Y chromosome denotes male sex. Boys and men with Klinefelter syndrome are still genetically male, and often will not realise they have this extra chromosome, but occasionally it can cause problems that may require treatment. Klinefelter syndrome is quite common, affecting around 1 in every 660 males. This page covers: Symptoms Health issues Causes Testing and diagnosis Treatments More information and support Symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome Klinefelter syndrome doesn't usually cause any obvious symptoms early in childhood, and even the later symptoms may be difficult to spot. Many boys and men don't realise they have it. Possible features, which aren't always present, may include: in babies and toddlers \u2013 learning to sit up, crawl, walk and talk later than usual, being weaker, quieter and more passive than usual in childhood \u2013 shyness and low self-confidence, problems with reading, writing, spelling and paying attention, mild dyslexia and\/or dyspraxia, low energy levels, difficulty socialising or expressing feelings in teenagers \u2013 growing taller than expected for the family (with long arms and legs), broad hips, poor muscle tone and slower than usual muscle growth, reduced facial and body hair that starts growing later than usual, a small penis and testicles, enlarged breasts (gynaecomastia) in adulthood \u2013 inability to have children naturally (infertility) and a low sex drive, in addition to the physical characteristics mentioned above Health issues in Klinefelter syndrome Most boys and men with Klinefelter syndrome will not be significantly affected and can live normal, healthy lives. Infertility tends to be the main problem, although there are treatments that can help (see Treatments below). However, men with Klinefelter syndrome are at a slightly increased risk of developing other health problems, including: type 2 diabetes weak and fragile bones (osteoporosis) cardiovascular disease and blood clots autoimmune disorders (where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body), such as lupus an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) anxiety, learning difficulties and depression \u2013 although intelligence is usually unaffected male breast cancer \u2013 although this is very rare These problems can usually be treated if they do occur and testosterone replacement therapy may help reduce the risk of some of them. Causes of Klinefelter syndrome Klinefelter syndrome is caused by an additional X chromosome. This chromosome carries extra copies of genes, which interfere with the development of the testicles and mean they produce less testosterone (male sex hormone) than usual. The extra genetic information may either be carried in every cell in the body or it may only affect some cells (known as mosaic Klinefelter syndrome). Klinefelter syndrome isn't directly inherited \u2013 the additional X chromosome occurs as a result of either the mother's egg or the father's sperm having the extra X chromosome (an equal chance of this happening in either), so after conception the chromosome pattern is XXY rather than XY. This change in the egg or sperm seems to happen randomly. If you have a son with the condition, the chances of this happening again are very small. However, the risk of a woman having a son with Klinefelter syndrome may be slightly higher if the mother is over 35 years of age. Testing for Klinefelter syndrome See your GP if you have concerns about your son's development or you notice any troubling symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome in yourself or your son. Klinefelter syndrome isn't necessarily anything serious, but treatment can help reduce some of the symptoms if necessary. In many cases, it's only detected if a man with the condition undergoes fertility tests. Your GP may suspect Klinefelter syndrome after a physical examination and they may suggest sending off a sample of blood to check reproductive hormone levels. The diagnosis can be confirmed by checking a sample of blood for the presence of the extra X chromosome. Treatments for Klinefelter syndrome There's no cure for Klinefelter syndrome, but some of the problems associated with the condition can be treated if necessary. Possible treatments include: testosterone replacement therapy (see below) speech and language therapy during childhood to help with speech development educational and behavioural support at school to help with any learning difficulties or behaviour problems occupational therapy to help with any co-ordination problems associated with dyspraxia physiotherapy to help build muscle and increase strength psychological support for any mental health issues fertility treatment \u2013 options include artificial insemination using donor sperm or possibly intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), where sperm removed during a small operation are used to fertilise an egg in a laboratory breast reduction surgery to remove excess breast tissue Testosterone replacement therapy TRT involves taking medication containing testosterone. It can be taken in the form of gels or tablets in teenagers, or given as gel or injections in adult men. TRT may be considered once puberty begins and may help with the development of a deep voice, facial and body hair, an increase in muscle mass, reduction in body fat, and improvement in energy. You should see a specialist in children's hormones (a paediatric endocrinologist) at this time. Long-term treatment during adulthood may also help with several other problems associated with Klinefelter syndrome \u2013 including osteoporosis, low mood, reduced sex drive, low self-esteem and low energy levels \u2013 although it can't reverse infertility. More information and support If you or your son has been diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome, you might find it useful to find out more about it and get in touch with others affected by it. The following websites may be able to help: Klinefelter's Syndrome Association UK Klinefelter Organisation Contact a Family Information about your child If your son has Klinefelter syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about him on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

In many cases, you don't need to see your GP. The knee joint is particularly vulnerable to damage and pain because it takes the full weight of your body and any extra force when you run or jump. You're more likely to experience knee pain as you get older, and people who are overweight or do lots of sports have a higher risk of damaging their knees. Some sports that involve a lot of turning, such as football, netball and skiing, carry a particularly high risk of knee injuries. This page summarises some of the most common causes of pain in one or both knees, and offers advice on when you should see your GP. Common causes of knee pain Common causes of knee pain include: sprains and strains anterior knee pain (pain around the kneecap) menisci or cartilage damage osteoarthritis tendonitis bursitis (housemaid's knee) torn ligaments or tendons bleeding into the joint Osgood-Schlatter's disease gout septic arthritis (infected knee joint) Click on these links for more information about these conditions. Simple sprain or strain If you think your pain is the result of having done more activity than you're used to, you've probably just sprained or strained your knee. This means that the knee tissues have stretched, but aren't permanently damaged. Read more about sprains and strains. Most sprains and strains can be managed yourself using PRICE therapy (protection, rest, ice, compression and elevation) and painkillers. Read more about treating sprains and strains. You can prevent future injuries by: always warming up before exercising and stretching to cool down after exercise increasing your activity levels slowly over time replacing your sports shoes when necessary You can also try low-impact exercises, such as cycling and swimming, to improve your health and fitness without harming your knees. Read about easy exercises. Anterior knee pain Knee pain felt at the front of the knee, around the kneecap, is called anterior knee pain or patellofemoral pain syndrome. It's not always obvious why this pain develops, but it's been linked to previous injuries, overuse of your knees, muscle weakness and your kneecap being slightly out of place. The pain tends to be dull or aching and often affects both knees at the same time. It's usually made worse by sitting for prolonged periods, squatting or kneeling, or using stairs. You can normally treat this yourself using ordinary painkillers, an ice pack and rest. Exercises to strengthen the muscles around your kneecap can also help. You may be referred to a physiotherapist, who can advise you about specific exercises to try. Damage to the menisci or cartilage Sitting between the upper and lower leg bones at the knee joint are rubbery pads of tissue called menisci. These cushion the bones, acting as shock absorbers. A meniscus can also be torn after suddenly twisting the knee joint, resulting in pain, swelling and occasionally locking of the knee. Rarely, the torn meniscus can flip into the joint and prevent you from straightening it. A meniscus can also be torn after suddenly twisting the knee joint, resulting in pain, swelling and occasionally locking of the knee. The cartilage covering the bones of the knee joint can also be damaged by injury (read more about cartilage damage). These symptoms may settle down with rest, although physiotherapy can sometimes help, and in the case of menisci damage, an operation may be needed to remove or repair the torn pad of tissue. Osteoarthritis In older people, recurrent pain and stiffness in both knees is likely to be caused by osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis in the UK. Osteoarthritis causes damage to the articular cartilage (protective surface of the knee bone) and mild swelling of the tissues in and around the joints. The pain in your joints may be worse after putting weight on your knees and your knees may become stiff if you don't move them for a while. They may also occasionally become locked or feel as though they're going to give way. In some cases, osteoarthritis can also cause a painful fluid-filled swelling to develop at the back of the knee \u2013 this is known as a Baker\u2019s cyst, or popliteal cyst. Less commonly, osteoarthritis can affect younger people, especially those who are overweight or have had serious injuries to the knee in the past. You should see your GP if you think your knee pain may be caused by osteoarthritis. They may recommend wearing suitable footwear to reduce the strain on your joints, using assistive devices such as a walking stick, losing weight, taking painkillers, or having physiotherapy. Read more about treating osteoarthritis. Tendonitis Overusing or injuring the tendon that connects the kneecap to the shin bone can cause patellar tendonitis (inflammation of the tendon). This condition is sometimes called \"jumper's knee\", as it can be brought on by jumping activities such as basketball or volleyball. As well as feeling painful and tender, your knee may also be swollen, red and warm. The pain can often be relieved with rest, ice packs and painkillers at home. Read more about treating tendonitis.  Bursitis Repetitive movement of the knee or kneeling for long periods can cause a build-up of fluid over the knee joint, known as bursitis or \"housemaid's knee\". This particularly affects people with certain jobs that involve kneeling (such as carpet layers), or sports players (such as footballers). It typically causes pain in the knee that gets worse when you kneel or bend your knee fully. Your knee will also probably be swollen and may be tender, red and warm. Bursitis can often be treated at home. Resting the affected area and using an ice pack helps reduce the swelling and ordinary painkillers can help relieve the pain until your knee heals. Read more about treating bursitis. If you develop redness that spreads, a high temperature (fever), or persistent pain, this may be due to infection of the bursae. You should see your GP urgently, or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Torn ligament or tendon Knee pain may be caused by torn ligaments or tendons. Ligaments are tough bands of tissue that connect the bones at the knee joint; tendons connect the muscles to the bone. You can tear these tissues during running sports such as rugby or football. Injured tendons or knee ligaments at the side of the knee may cause pain even when the knee is at rest, which may get worse when you bend the knee or put weight on it. There may also be warmth and swelling around the knee. If you feel that your knee is also unstable or keeps \"giving way\", you may have torn the anterior cruciate ligament (one of the main knee ligaments). This probably resulted from a sudden change in direction or a twisting movement, and you may have heard a pop when it happened.  You should see your GP if this happens, and you may be referred to an orthopaedic specialist for advice and treatment. In some cases, surgery may be recommended. Read about surgery to repair a damaged knee ligament. Bleeding into the joint An injury that causes significant damage to the knee joint may cause bleeding into the joint spaces, known as haemarthrosis. This can happen if a cruciate ligament is torn or if there is a fracture to one of the bones of the knee. Signs of haemarthrosis are swelling of the knee, warmth, stiffness and bruising. You should go to hospital immediately to have your knee treated if you have a badly swollen knee. Surgery may be required to repair the damage. If you take anticoagulant medication such as warfarin, bleeding into the joint can happen without any obvious damage. You should see your GP in this case as you may need treatment to reverse the effects on your medication. Osgood-Schlatter's disease In teenagers and young adults, pain, swelling and tenderness in the bony lump just below the kneecap could be a sign of Osgood-Schlatter's disease.  This is a where the bone at the top of the lower leg becomes damaged during a growth spurt. It's relatively common in active children who participate in sports that involve running, jumping and repetitive bending on the knees. Reducing activity levels, taking painkillers and using ice packs can help relieve the pain in most children. The problem will normally resolve completely once your child stops having growth spurts, although occasionally it can persist into adulthood. Gout If you experience sudden attacks of severe knee pain and your knee also becomes red and hot, the cause is likely to be gout, which is a type of arthritis. Gout is caused by a build-up of uric acid (a waste product) in the body, which can form crystals in the joints. These crystals cause the joints to become inflamed and painful. Gout will cause severe pain in the knee and limit movement of the joint. You may feel pain even when you're resting, including at night. Gout can affect any joint in the body and sometimes other joints such as the joint of your big toe may be affected before your knees. You should see your GP if you think the cause of your knee pain is gout. They may recommend using ice packs and taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) painkillers. You may also need to change your diet or receive additional treatment to prevent attacks if you experience them frequently. Read more about treating gout. Septic arthritis (infected knee) Septic arthritis is a serious condition that causes a very painful, hot, swollen knee. You may also feel generally unwell and have a fever. It can be mistaken for gout (see above). You should see your GP urgently, or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if you suspect you have septic arthritis. Septic arthritis is treated by draining fluid from the knee before antibiotics are given. Occasionally arthroscopic surgery is needed to clear out the infection. When to see your GP You should see your GP if: you cannot put weight on your knee at all you have severe pain even when you're not putting weight on it, such as at night your knee locks or painfully clicks (painless clicking is OK) your knee keeps giving way you're unable to fully bend or straighten your knee your knee looks deformed you have fever, redness or heat around the knee, or it's very swollen you have pain, swelling, numbness or tingling of the calf beneath your affected knee the pain doesn't start to improve within a few weeks or you have pain that's still severe after a few days of caring for your knee at home Your GP will do a careful examination of the knee and take your medical history. They may also arrange further tests such as blood tests, an X-ray or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to help identify the problem. In some cases, you may need to be referred to an orthopaedic specialist.

Adults of any age can be considered for a knee replacement, although most are carried out on people between the ages of 60 and 80. More people are now receiving this operation at a younger age. A replacement knee usually lasts over 20 years, especially if the new knee is cared for properly and not put under too much strain. When a knee replacement is needed Knee replacement surgery is usually necessary when the knee joint is worn or damaged to the extent that your mobility is reduced and you experience pain even while resting. The most common reason for knee replacement surgery is osteoarthritis. Other conditions that cause knee damage include: rheumatoid arthritis haemophilia gout disorders that cause unusual bone growth (bone dysplasias) death of bone in the knee joint following blood supply problems (avascular necrosis) knee injury knee deformity with pain and loss of cartilage Who is offered knee replacement surgery A knee replacement is major surgery, so is normally only recommended if other treatments, such as physiotherapy or steroid injections, haven't helped reduce pain or improve mobility. You may be offered knee replacement surgery if: you have severe pain, swelling and stiffness in your knee joint and your mobility is reduced your knee pain is so severe that it interferes with your quality of life and sleep everyday tasks, such as shopping or getting out of the bath, are difficult or impossible you're feeling depressed because of the pain and lack of mobility you can't work or have a normal social life You'll also need to be well enough to cope with both a major operation and the rehabilitation afterwards. Types of knee replacement surgery There are two main types of surgery, depending on the condition of the knee: total knee replacement (TKR) \u2013 both sides of your knee joint are replaced partial (half) knee replacement (PKR) \u2013 only one side of your joint is replaced in a smaller operation with a shorter hospital stay and recovery period Read more about how knee replacement surgery is performed. Alternative surgery There are alternative surgeries to knee replacement, but results are often not as good in the long term. Your doctor will discuss the best treatment option with you. Alternatives may include: arthroscopic washout and debridement \u2013 an arthroscope (tiny telescope) is inserted into the knee, which is then washed out with saline to clear out any bits of bone or cartilage osteotomy \u2013 during an open operation, the surgeon cuts the shin bone and realigns it so that weight is no longer focused on the damaged part of the knee mosaicplasty \u2013 a keyhole operation that involves transferring plugs of hard cartilage, together with some underlying bone from another part of your knee, to repair the damaged surface Choosing a specialist Choose a specialist who performs knee replacement regularly and can discuss their results with you. This is even more important if you're having a second or subsequent knee replacement (revision knee replacement), which is more difficult to perform. Your local hospital trust website will show which specialists in your area do knee replacement. Your GP may also have a recommendation, or arrange for you to follow an enhanced recovery programme. You can also read a guide to NHS waiting times. Preparing for knee replacement surgery Before you go into hospital, find out as much as you can about what's involved in your operation. Your hospital should provide written information or videos. Stay as active as you can. Strengthening the muscles around your knee will aid your recovery. If you can, continue to take gentle exercise, such as walking and swimming, in the weeks and months before your operation. You can be referred to a physiotherapist, who will give you helpful exercises. Read about preparing for surgery, including information on travel arrangements, what to bring with you and attending a pre-operative assessment. Recovering from knee replacement surgery You'll usually be in hospital for three to five days, but recovery times can vary depending on the individual and type of surgery being carried out.  Once you're able to be discharged, your hospital will give you advice about looking after your knee at home. You'll need to use a frame or crutches at first and a physiotherapist will teach you exercises to help strengthen your knee. Most people can stop using walking aids around six weeks after surgery, and start driving after about eight to 12 weeks.  Full recovery can take up to two years as scar tissue heals and your muscles are restored by exercise. A very small amount of people will continue to experience some pain after two years. Read about recovering from knee replacement surgery. Risks of knee replacement surgery Knee replacement surgery is a common operation and most people don't experience complications. However, as with any operation, there are risks as well as benefits. Complications are rare but can include: stiffness of the knee infection of the wound deep infection of the joint replacement, needing further surgery  unexpected bleeding into the knee joint ligament, artery or nerve damage in the area around the knee joint blood clots or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) persistent pain the in the knee fracture \u2013 a break in the bone around the knee replacement during or after the operation In some cases, the new knee joint may not be completely stable and further surgery may be needed to correct it. Read more about the risks of knee replacement surgery. The National Joint Registry The National Joint Registry (NJR) collects details of knee replacements carried out in England and Wales. Although it's voluntary, it's worth registering. This enables the NJR to monitor knee replacements, so you can be identified if any problems emerge in the future. The registry also gives you the chance to participate in a patient feedback survey. It's confidential and you have a right under the Freedom of Information Act to see what details are kept about you.

The ACL is a tough band of tissue joining the thigh bone to the shin bone at the knee joint. It runs diagonally through the inside of the knee and gives the knee joint stability. It also helps to control the back-and-forth movement of the lower leg. ACL injuries Knee injuries can occur during sports such as skiing, tennis, squash, football and rugby. ACL injuries are one of the most common types of knee injuries, accounting for around 40% of all sports injuries. You can tear your ACL if your lower leg extends forwards too much. It can also be torn if your knee and lower leg are twisted. Common causes of an ACL injury include: landing incorrectly from a jump stopping suddenly changing direction suddenly having a collision, such as during a football tackle If the ACL is torn, your knee may become very unstable and lose its full range of movement. This can make it difficult to perform certain movements, such as turning on the spot. Some sports may be impossible to play. Deciding to have surgery The decision to have knee surgery will depend on the extent of damage to your ACL and whether it's affecting your quality of life. If your knee doesn't feel unstable and you don't have an active lifestyle, you may decide not to have ACL surgery. However, it's important to be aware that delaying surgery could cause further damage to your knee. Read more about deciding to have surgery. Before having surgery Before having ACL surgery, you may need to wait for any swelling to go down and the full range of movement to return to your knee. You may also need to wait until the muscles at the front of your thigh (quadriceps) and the back of your thigh (hamstrings) are as strong as possible. If you don't have the full range of movement in your knee before having surgery, your recovery will be more difficult. It's likely to take at least three weeks after the injury occurred for the full range of movement to return. Before having surgery, you may be referred for physiotherapy to help you regain the full range of movement in your knee. Your physiotherapist may show you some stretches that you can do at home to help keep your leg flexible. They may also recommend low-impact exercise, such as swimming or cycling. These types of activities will improve your muscle strength without placing too much weight on your knee. You should avoid any sports or activities that involve twisting, turning or jumping. Read more about preparing for ACL surgery. Reconstructive ACL surgery A torn ACL can't be repaired by stitching it back together. However, it can be reconstructed by grafting (attaching) new tissue onto it. The ACL can be reconstructed by removing what remains of the torn ligament and replacing it with a tendon from another area of the leg, such as the hamstring or patellar tendon. The patellar tendon attaches the bottom of the kneecap (patella) to the top of the shinbone (tibia). Read more about how ACL reconstructive surgery is performed. Risks of ACL surgery ACL surgery fully restores the functioning of the knee in over 80% of cases. However, your knee may not be exactly like it was before the injury, and you may still have some pain and swelling. This may be because of other injuries to the knee, such as tears or injuries to the cartilage, which happened at the same time as or after the ACL injury. As with all types of surgery, there are some small risks associated with knee surgery, including infection, a blood clot, knee pain, and knee weakness and stiffness. Read more about the risks of ACL surgery. Recovering from surgery After having reconstructive ACL surgery, a few people may still experience knee pain or instability. Recovering from surgery usually takes around six months. However, it could be up to a year before you're able to return to full training for your sport. Read more about recovering from ACL reconstructive surgery.  The knee The three bones that meet in the knee are the: thigh bone (femur) shin bone (tibia) kneecap (patella) The three bones are connected by four ligaments \u2013 two collateral ligaments on the sides of the knee and two cruciate ligaments inside the knee.  Ligaments are tough bands of connective tissue. The ligaments in the knee hold the bones together and help keep the knee stable.

A bursa is a fluid-filled sac which forms under the skin, usually over the joints, and acts as a cushion between the tendons and bones. The main symptoms of bursitis are pain, swelling and tenderness in the affected area. Any bursa can become inflamed, but bursitis most commonly occurs in the: shoulder elbow  knee (known as housemaid's knee) hip Other areas affected can include the ankle, foot and Achilles tendon (the large tendon that attaches the heel bone to the calf muscle).  What causes bursitis? A bursa can become inflamed through injury or repetitive movement. Your risk of developing bursitis is increased if you regularly take part in physical activities that involve a lot of repetitive movement, for example running (bursitis in the ankle) or playing darts (bursitis in the elbow). People who spend a lot of time kneeling, such as carpet fitters and gardeners, also have an increased risk of developing bursitis in their knee. Less commonly, bursitis can develop as a result of an infection or as a complication of certain conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis. Read more about the causes of bursitis. Treating bursitis Most cases of bursitis can be treated at home. Resting the affected area, using an ice pack (a frozen bag of vegetables wrapped in a tea towel works well) to reduce inflammation, and taking painkillers such as aspirin, paracetamol and ibuprofen will help relieve your symptoms and speed up your recovery. The pain usually improves within a few weeks, but the swelling may take longer to completely disappear. See your GP if your symptoms do not improve after two weeks. Read more about treating bursitis. Preventing bursitis Taking precautions, such as wearing knee pads when kneeling and warming up properly before exercise, may help reduce your risk of getting bursitis.

They act as cushions between two surfaces that rub against each other, such as bones, muscles, joints and tendons.  Each bursa is lined with special cells called synovial cells. The cells produce a liquid that lubricates the body's moving parts and helps reduce friction.

It's often caused by a blow or a sudden change in direction when the leg is planted on the ground, such as during sports or dancing. The kneecap (patella) normally sits over the front of the knee. It glides over a groove in the joint when you bend or straighten your leg. When the kneecap dislocates, it comes out of this groove and the supporting tissues can be stretched or torn. This page covers: Symptoms What to do Treatment Recovery Repeated dislocations Symptoms of a dislocated kneecap When a kneecap dislocates, it will usually look out of place or at an odd angle. But in many cases it will pop back into place soon afterwards. Other symptoms can include: a \"popping\" sensation severe knee pain being unable to straighten the knee sudden swelling of the knee being unable to walk What to do if you dislocate your kneecap A dislocated kneecap isn't usually serious and will often pop back into place by itself. But it's still a good idea to get it checked by a health professional: if your kneecap has gone back into place by itself \u2013 go to your nearest minor injuries unit (MIU) or accident and emergency (A&E) department if your kneecap hasn't gone back into place \u2013 call an ambulance: don't try to put it back in place yourself While you're on your way to hospital or waiting for an ambulance, sit still with your leg in the most comfortable position. Treatment for a dislocated kneecap If your kneecap hasn't corrected itself by the time you get to hospital, a doctor will manipulate it back into place. This is known as a reduction. You may be given medication to ensure you're relaxed and free from pain while this is done. Once the kneecap is back in place, you may have an X-ray to check the bones are in the correct position and there's no other damage. You'll be sent home with painkillers and your leg will normally be immobilised in a removable splint to begin with. A few weeks of physiotherapy will be recommended to aid your recovery. Surgery is usually only necessary if there was a fracture or another associated injury, such as a ligament tear. It may also be done if you have dislocated your kneecap at least once before. Read more about repeated kneecap dislocations. Recovering from a dislocated kneecap Your knee may hurt at first and you'll probably need to take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. See your GP if this doesn't control the pain. During the first few days, you can help reduce any swelling by keeping your leg elevated when sitting and holding an ice pack to your knee for 10 to 15 minutes every few hours. A physiotherapist will teach you some exercises to do at home to strengthen the muscles that stabilise your kneecap and improve the movement of your knee. The splint should only be kept on for comfort and should be removed to do these exercises as soon as you're able to move your leg. It usually takes about six weeks to fully recover from a dislocated kneecap, although sometimes it can take a bit longer to return to sports or other strenuous activities. Ask your GP, consultant or physiotherapist for advice about returning to your normal activities. If you keep dislocating your kneecap Most people who dislocate their kneecap won't dislocate it again. But in some people it can keep happening. This often occurs if the tissues that support the kneecap are weak or loose, such as in people with hypermobile joints, or because the groove in the bone beneath the kneecap is too shallow or uneven. Regularly doing the exercises your physiotherapist recommends can help strengthen the tissues that hold the kneecap in place and reduce the risk of dislocating it again. Surgery may occasionally be needed if the kneecap keeps dislocating. A common procedure is a medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) repair. This is where the connective tissue (ligament) that helps hold the kneecap in place is repaired and strengthened.

Many young children have knock knees, which tend to be most obvious at around the age of four. This is almost always just a normal part of their development, and their legs will normally straighten by the age of six or seven. Slight knock knees can continue into adulthood, but this also isn't usually anything to worry about unless it causes other problems. However, knock knees can very occasionally be a sign of an underlying condition that requires treatment, especially if the condition develops in older children or adults, or doesn't improve at all with age. The medical name for knock knees is genu valgum. This page covers: Symptoms of knock knees When to seek medical advice What causes knock knees? Treatments for knock knees Symptoms of knock knees If someone with knock knees stands with their knees together, their lower legs will be spread out so their feet and ankles are further apart than normal. A small distance between the ankles is normal, but in people with knock knees this gap can be up to 8cm (just over 3 inches) or more. Knock knees don't usually cause any other problems, although a few severe cases may cause knee pain, a limp or difficulty walking. Knock knees that don't improve on their own can also place your knees under extra pressure, which may increase your risk of developing arthritis. When to seek medical advice Knock knees in children aren't usually a cause for concern and should improve as your child gets older. However, visit your GP if: the gap between the ankles is greater than 8cm while standing with the knees together there's a big difference between the angle of the lower legs when standing compared with the upper legs  the problem seems to be getting worse a child under the age of two or over the age of seven has knock knees only one leg is affected there are other symptoms, such as knee pain or difficulty walking you have any other concerns about the way your child stands or walks you develop knock knees in adulthood Your GP will examine your or your child's legs, ask about any pain or walking difficulties, and may take some measurements.  They may refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon (a specialist in bone and joint problems) and arrange an X-ray of your legs and blood tests to check for underlying problems. What causes knock knees? Knock knees are fairly common in healthy children under the ages of six or seven, and are just a normal part of growth and development. The legs will normally gradually straighten as the child grows, although mild knock knees can last into adulthood. Knock knees that develop later in childhood or don't improve with age can sometimes be associated with an underlying problem, such as: rickets \u2013 problems with bone development resulting from a lack of vitamin D and calcium excessive pressure on the knees \u2013 for example, as a result of obesity or loose knee ligaments (the bands of tissue around joints that connect bones to one another) an injury or infection affecting the knees or leg bones genetic conditions affecting the development of the bones or joints Adults can sometimes develop knock knees. These cases are often associated with joint problems such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Treatments for knock knees In most cases, knock knees don't need to be treated because the problem tends to correct itself as a child grows. Your child doesn't need to avoid physical activity, wear supportive leg braces or shoes, or do any special exercises. Mild knock knees that persist into adulthood don't need to be treated unless they're causing problems, such as knee pain. Treating the underlying cause If knock knees are caused by an underlying condition, treatment for this may be necessary. For example, rickets can be treated with vitamin D and calcium supplements. Read more about treating rickets. Adults with arthritis may benefit from wearing leg braces or special insoles to reduce the strain on their knees. Read more about treating osteoarthritis and treating rheumatoid arthritis. Surgery Surgery for knock knees is rarely necessary, although it may be recommended if the condition is severe or persistent. There are two main types of operation that may be carried out: guided growth \u2013 where small metal plates are placed on the inside of the knees, which helps correct their growth over a period of around 12 months; the plates will be removed once the treatment is complete an osteotomy \u2013 where a thin wedge of bone is removed from the leg bones so they're realigned into the correct position; plates and screws are used to fix the bones in their new position Children with persistent knock knees who are still rapidly growing are more likely to be offered the guided growth operation. Osteotomies are mainly used for adults with severe knock knees. Both procedures are carried out under general anaesthetic, which means you or your child will be asleep while having the operation. A child can usually start walking again within a few days of a guided growth procedure and return to sports within a few weeks. It can take a few months to return to all your normal activities after an osteotomy.

They're often a sign of a fungal nail infection or injury, but can sometimes indicate a more serious underlying disease. Visit your GP if your nails have changed in colour, texture, shape or thickness and you don't know why (you haven't injured your nails or been biting them). This guide gives the most likely reasons for the following nail problems: brittle or crumbly nails  discoloured nails  white nails  thickened, overgrown nails  loose nails  indented spoon-shaped nails  pitting or dents on the nails  grooves going across the width of the nails  unusually curved fingertips and nails  white lines running across the nails  dark stripes running down the nail  red or brown little streaks under the nails  a destroyed nail  infected nail fold (painful, red and swollen skin next to the nail) Brittle or crumbly nails Brittle nails are often just a sign of ageing or long-term exposure to water or chemicals such as detergents and nail polish. Nails can be strengthened by taking biotin (vitamin B7) supplements, by wearing gloves for all wet work and by frequently applying moisturising cream to the nails. Sometimes, brittle or crumbly nails can be caused by: a fungal nail infection, which can be cleared by taking a course of antifungal tablets (this especially tends to be the cause for crumbly toenails) a skin condition called lichen planus, which can just affect the nails an underactive thyroid or overactive thyroid, where the thyroid gland either doesn't produce enough hormones or produces too many nail psoriasis, a long-term skin condition that can cause the nails to become crumbly A less common cause of crumbly nails is reactive arthritis, an unusual reaction of the immune system affecting the joints, muscles and other parts of the body following an infection. If you have a combination of symptoms affecting different parts of your body, your GP might consider this condition. Discoloured nails The most common causes of a yellow nail are fungal nail infections or nail psoriasis. Yellow nails can also result from any of the following: frequent application of nail varnish lymphoedema, a long-term condition that causes swelling of the skin permanent damage to your airways caused by bronchiectasis (a long-term lung condition) sinusitis (inflammation of the lining of the sinuses) inflammation of the thyroid gland, found in the neck tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial infection affecting the lungs jaundice (yellowing of the skin) due to liver disease some drugs, such as mepacrine or carotene   chronic paronychia (infection of the nail fold) Green-black nails can be caused by overgrowth of bacteria called pseudomonas, especially under loose nails. This can be treated by applying antibiotic eye drops underneath the nails or soaking the affected nails in an antiseptic solution or vinegar. Grey nails can be caused by medication such as antimalarials or minocycline. Brown nails can sometimes be caused by thyroid disease, pregnancy, malnutrition and frequent use of nail varnish. Red or yellow drop under the nail If the discolouration looks like a drop of oil under the nail plate or is the colour of salmon, you may have psoriasis of the nails. Half white, half brown nails Fingernails that are half white and half brown (brown near the tips) can be a sign of kidney failure, where the kidneys stop working properly. The link is not fully understood, but one theory is that kidney failure causes chemical changes in the blood that encourage melanin (a skin pigment) to be released into the nail bed. It's also possible that kidney failure causes an increase in the number of tiny blood vessels in the nail bed. It's estimated up to 40% of people with kidney failure have \"half-and-half\" fingernails. Half-and-half nails have also been seen in some people with AIDS and can be seen following chemotherapy. White nails If most of the nail plate has turned white and it's not because the nail has become detached from the nail bed, it's likely to be either a fungal nail infection or a sign of decreased blood supply to the nail bed, known as \"Terry's nails\". Terry's nails are typically white with reddened or dark tips and can be a sign of a wide range of medical conditions, including the following: liver cirrhosis (scarring and damage to the liver) \u2013 about 80% of people with cirrhosis have Terry's nails liver, kidney or heart failure diabetes iron-deficiency anaemia \u2013 a reduced number of red blood cells due to a lack of iron in the body chemotherapy an overactive thyroid (where the thyroid gland in your neck produces too many hormones) malnutrition  Thickened, overgrown nails A common cause of thickened nails is a fungal nail infection. This can also cause them to discolour and become crumbly (see above). Other possible causes of thickened or overgrown nails are: psoriasis, a long-term condition that tends to also cause red, flaky patches of skin long-term pressure from shoes that are either too small or too narrow over the toes reactive arthritis, where the immune system attacks the joints, muscles and other parts of the body following an infection Severely overgrown horn-like nails Sometimes, the big toenails become so overgrown and thickened that they resemble claws and are almost impossible to cut with conventional nail clippers. This nail disorder is known as onychogryphosis (\"ram's horn nails\"), and is seen in older people or as a response to long-term pressure on the nails. Regular chiropody can help, but sometimes the nails need to be removed by a podiatrist or doctor. Loose nails It's normal for a toenail to come loose and fall off after an injury to the toe. However, if you haven't injured your nail, a loose nail is often caused by over-manicuring the nails and cleaning under the nails with a sharp object. Less commonly, it may be a sign of one of the following health conditions: a fungal nail infection psoriasis of the nail \u2013 psoriasis is a long-term condition that tends to also cause red, flaky patches of skin warts that cluster around the fingernail an overactive thyroid, which means the thyroid gland in the neck is producing too many hormones  sarcoidosis, a condition where small clumps of cells form in the organs and tissues of the body amyloidosis, where protein builds up in the organs a problem with the connective tissue fibres in the body that support the organs and body tissues poor circulation, for example caused by smoking or Raynaud's disease  an allergic reaction to medicine (usually to a type of antibiotic) or nail cosmetics A loose nail should be cut back to where it's detached to allow the nail to become reattached as it grows. You shouldn't clean your nails with anything other than a soft nailbrush. Indented spoon-shaped nails (koilonychia) If your fingernails curve inwards like spoons (known medically as koilonychia), you may have one of the following disorders: iron-deficiency anaemia, which is a reduced number of red blood cells due to a lack of iron in the body haemochromatosis, where the body contains too much iron Raynaud\u2019s disease, a common condition affecting the blood supply to the fingers and toes, causing them to turn white  lupus erythematosus, an uncommon condition where the immune system attacks the body's cells, tissues and organs Pitting or dents on the nails Pitting or small dents on the surface of your nails can be a sign of any of the following diseases: psoriasis, a long-term condition that tends to also cause red, flaky patches of skin (10%-50% of patients with psoriasis have pitted nails) eczema, a long-term skin condition reactive arthritis, where the immune system attacks the joints, muscles and other parts of the body following an infection alopecia areata, patches of hair loss that tend to come and go Grooves across the fingernails (Beau's lines) Deep lines or grooves that go from left to right across the nail are known as Beau's lines. They may be a sign of: a previous illness \u2013 the line forms at the time of the illness  chemotherapy a previous injury previous exposure to extremely cold temperatures, if you have Raynaud's disease Illness, injury or cold temperatures can interrupt nail growth and cause nail grooves to form at the base of the nails. These grooves tend to only be noticed a few months later, when the nails have grown and the grooves have moved up the nails to become visible. It takes about four to six months for a fingernail to fully grow out, and 6-12 months for a toenail. Unusually curved fingertips and nails Clubbing of the fingertips means the tissue beneath the nails thickens and the fingertips become rounded and bulbous. The fingernails curve over the rounded fingertips. Clubbing is thought to result from increased blood flow to the fingertips. It can run in families and be entirely harmless. However, if it suddenly develops, it may be a sign of one of many possible medical conditions, including: long-term lung disease or heart disease, such as lung cancer, bronchiectasis, or endocarditis inflammatory bowel disease, a long-term disease that causes inflammation of the lining of the gut stomach cancer or bowel cancer cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) polycythaemia, a condition where the blood is too thick  White lines running across nails White spots or streaks are normal and nothing to worry about, but parallel white lines that extend all the way across the nails, known as Muehrcke's lines, are a sign of low levels of protein in the blood. In contrast to Beau's lines (see above), they're not grooved. They can be due to liver disease or malnutrition. Dark stripes running down the nail If you have dark skin, it's fairly common to find dark stripes running down your nails (linear melanonychia). This occurs in more than 77% of black people over the age of 20, and in most cases is perfectly normal. However, it's not something to ignore: dark stripes may sometimes be a form of skin cancer that affects the nail bed, called subungual melanoma. It's important that your doctor checks it to rule out melanoma. Generally, subungual melanoma only affects one nail. Also, it will cause the stripe to change in appearance (for example, it may become wider or darker over time) and the pigmentation may also affect the surrounding skin (the nail fold). Red or brown little streaks under the nails If you have what look like red or brown little streaks underneath the nails, it's likely these are splinter haemorrhages \u2013 lines of blood caused by tiny damaged blood vessels. Just a few splinters under one nail are nothing to worry about and most likely due to injury of the nail. However, if many nails are affected, these splinters may be a sign of lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, an infection of the heart valves (endocarditis) or another underlying disease. A destroyed nail Nails can be destroyed by: injury, including nail biting skin diseases such as psoriasis or lichen planus overgrowth of the surrounding tissues, which is usually harmless (for example, due to a wart or verruca) but can sometimes be cancerous nail patella syndrome \u2013 an uncommon genetic condition which may cause missing nails, usually at birth  If one of your nails becomes destroyed and you don't remember injuring it, it's important to see your GP. Painful, red and swollen nail fold (paronychia) Paronychia is the name for inflammation of the nail fold, which is the skin and soft tissue that frames and supports the nail. This is most often caused by infection, injury or irritation. It's about three times more common in women than in men. Sometimes, there's an underlying skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis or another medical condition such as diabetes or HIV. Paronychia can be acute, where it develops over a few hours, or chronic, where it lasts more than six weeks. Acute paronychia Acute infective paronychia usually starts after a minor injury to the nail fold, such as from nail biting, picking or manicures. The affected area is red, warm, tender and swollen. After a while pus may be seen, which can form around the nail and may lift the nail. Acute paronychia is often caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, although any number of germs can be involved. Treatment is with antibiotic creams or tablets. If there's a large amount of pus, it can help to have this surgically drained. Sometimes, acute paronychia is caused by the cold sore virus, in which case it's known as herpetic whitlow. Acute paronychia can completely clear in a few days with treatment, but if it's not treated or doesn't respond to treatment, it can become long-term (chronic). Chronic paronychia Chronic paronychia may start more gradually and be more difficult to get rid of. It's most common in people who often have their hands in water or chemicals, such as cleaners, bartenders, canteen staff or fishmongers. It may start in one nail fold but can affect several fingers. The affected nail folds are swollen and may be red and sore from time to time, often after exposure to water. The nail plate gradually becomes thickened and ridged as it grows, and may become yellow or green and brittle. The skin in chronic paronychia is often colonised by a mixture of yeasts and bacteria. These germs thrive on previously damaged skin, without necessarily starting the skin damage in the first place. To settle chronic paronychia, both the skin damage and the colonisation with germs needs to be addressed. It can take months for chronic paronychia to clear, and after that up to a year for nails to grow back to normal. You may find that doing things such as keeping your hands dry and warm, frequently using emollient hand cream and avoiding biting and picking your nails can help.  See your GP if the condition is severe. Depending on the type of paronychia, creams and\/or tablets may be prescribed. Use these as directed. You may be referred to a dermatologist for further investigation of the underlying skin disease or for contact allergy testing, and for treatment advice.

The main sign of kwashiorkor is having too much fluid in body tissues, causing swelling under the skin (oedema). It usually begins in the legs, but can involve the whole body, including the face. The following symptoms can also be present: red, inflamed patches of skin that darken and peel or split open dry, sparse, brittle hair that may turn reddish yellow or white drowsiness and tiredness irritability failure to grow loss of muscle mass an enlarged tummy ('pot belly') regular or persistent infections ridged or cracked nails If the condition is left untreated for too long, it can be fatal. Why does it happen? Kwashiorkor is most commonly seen in developing regions of the world with an unstable food supply, particularly in countries where the diet consists mainly of corn, rice and beans which lack essential nutrients such as proteins, vitamins and minerals. However, the exact cause remains unknown. The condition is unusual in developed countries such as the UK, although it can occasionally occur as a result of problems such as severe neglect, long-term (chronic) illness, a lack of knowledge about nutrition or a very restricted diet. Kwashiorkor can affect people of all ages, but is more common in children than adults. How it is diagnosed Kwashiorkor can be diagnosed based on physical appearance and knowledge about the person's diet and care. There are other conditions that may cause oedema and the other signs of kwashiorkor. Blood and urine tests may be done to exclude these and to see how kwashiorkor is affecting the body, including measuring blood sugar and protein levels, checking how well the liver and kidneys are working, checking for anaemia and measuring the levels of vitamins and minerals in the body. Other tests may include growth measurements, calculating body mass index (BMI), measuring body water content, taking a skin biopsy and analysing a hair sample. How it is treated If it is identified early, kwashiorkor can sometimes be treated with either specially formulated milk-based feeds or ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF), which is typically made up of peanut butter, milk powder, sugar, vegetable oil and added vitamins and minerals. In severe cases, or where there are already complications such as infections, more intensive treatment provided as an inpatient in a hospital or clinic will be needed. Inpatient treatment will usually involve: correcting or preventing low blood glucose keeping the person warm, as kwashiorkor can cause difficulty generating body heat treating dehydration if it is present with specially-formulated rehydration solution treating infections with antibiotics, as kwashiorkor greatly increases the risk of infections correcting vitamin and mineral deficiencies \u2013 vitamin supplements are usually included in the special milks or RUTF slowly introducing small amounts of food at first because it may upset the body\u2019s metabolism, before gradually increasing the strength and amount of food eaten to promote weight gain and growth This whole process generally takes between two and six weeks to complete. Play and stimulation are an important part of recovery from kwashiorkor, as well as ensuring nutrition and care provided at home are adequate. Outlook How well a person with kwashiorkor does after treatment depends on the severity of the condition when treatment began.  If treatment was started early, the person usually recovers well, although children may never reach their full growth potential. If treatment was started in the later stages of malnutrition, the person may be left with physical and intellectual disabilities. If kwashiorkor is not treated or treatment is delayed, it can result in death. Children with kwashiorkor often develop an enlarged 'pot belly'  Marasmus Marasmus is another type of malnutrition often found in developing regions of the world affected by an unstable food supply. The condition is generally associated with a lack of protein, calories and other nutrients in the diet and, unlike kwashiorkor, it tends to lead to significant loss of fat and muscle without any associated swelling (oedema). It's not clear exactly why some severely malnourished children develop marasmus and others develop kwashiorkor, although it is not thought to be solely due to diet because both conditions can occur in children with very similar diets. Marasmus is generally treated in the same way as kwashiorkor.
