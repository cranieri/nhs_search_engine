It can cause bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and\/or constipation. The symptoms vary between individuals and affect some people more severely than others. They tend to come and go in periods lasting a few days to a few months at a time, often during times of stress or after eating certain foods. You may find some of the symptoms of IBS ease after going to the toilet and opening your bowels. IBS is thought to affect up to one in five people at some point in their life, and it usually first develops when a person is between 20 and 30 years of age. Around twice as many women are affected as men. The condition is often lifelong, although it may improve over several years. Read more about the symptoms of IBS. When to see your GP See your GP if you think you have IBS symptoms, so they can try to determine the cause. Your GP may be able to identify IBS based on your symptoms, although blood tests may be needed to rule out other conditions. Read more about diagnosing IBS. What causes IBS? The exact cause of IBS is unknown, but most experts think that it's related to increased sensitivity of the gut and problems digesting food. These problems may mean that you are more sensitive to pain coming from your gut, and you may become constipated or have diarrhoea because your food passes through your gut either too slowly or too quickly. Psychological factors such as stress may also play a part in IBS. Read more about the causes of IBS. How IBS is treated There is no cure for IBS, but the symptoms can often be managed by making changes to your diet and lifestyle. For example, it may help to: identify and avoid foods or drinks that trigger your symptoms alter the amount of fibre in your diet exercise regularly reduce your stress levels Medication is sometimes prescribed for people with IBS to treat the individual symptoms they experience. Read more about treating IBS. Living with IBS IBS is unpredictable. You may go for many months without any symptoms, then have a sudden flare-up. The condition can also be painful and debilitating, which can have a negative impact on your quality of life and emotional state. Many people with IBS will experience feelings of depression and anxiety, at some point.  Speak to your GP if you have feelings of depression or anxiety that are affecting your daily life. These problems rarely improve without treatment and your GP can recommend treatments such as antidepressants or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which can help you cope with IBS, as well as directly treating the condition. With appropriate medical and psychological treatment, you should be able to live a normal, full and active life with IBS.  IBS does not pose a serious threat to your physical health and does not increase your chances of developing cancer or other bowel-related conditions.

There are at least 20 different types of ichthyosis. Some types are inherited at birth and other types are acquired during adulthood. There's no cure for ichthyosis, but a daily skincare routine usually keeps the symptoms mild and manageable. This topic covers: What causes ichthyosis Ichthyosis vulgaris Other types of inherited ichthyosis Acquired ichthyosis Treating ichthyosis Outlook Helping with research What causes ichthyosis Most people with ichthyosis have inherited a particular faulty gene from their parent. The signs and symptoms of inherited ichthyosis appear at birth or within the first year of life. The faulty gene affects the rate at which the skin regenerates \u2013 either the shedding of old skin cells is too slow, or the skin cells reproduce at a much faster rate than they can shed old skin. Either way, this causes a build-up of rough, scaly skin. Ichthyosis vulgaris Ichthyosis vulgaris is the most common type of inherited ichthyosis, affecting 1 in 250-1,000 people. Signs and symptoms include: skin may appear normal at birth skin gradually becomes dry, rough and scaly, usually before the age of one the face and the bends of the elbows and knees aren't usually affected limbs may develop fine light-grey scales the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet may have more lines than normal and be thickened the child often also has eczema symptoms are often worse when it's cold and dry and improve in warm, humid conditions \u2013 this means they may be more noticeable in the winter than the summer Other types of inherited ichthyosis Other inherited forms of ichthyosis are very rare and include: X-linked ichthyosis \u2013 only affects males and includes general scaling, particularly over the limbs and trunk (torso)  congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma  harlequin ichthyosis \u2013 this is extremely rare, but the scaling is severe and requires intensive care at birth syndromes that include ichthyosis \u2013 such as Netherton's syndrome or Sjögren-Larsson syndrome Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma Ichthyosis may develop if a baby is born with a shiny yellow membrane (collodion membrane) that sheds within the first week of life. Once the membrane has shed, one of the following types of ichthyosis can develop: non-bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma \u2013 inflamed scaly skin that affects the entire skin surface bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma \u2013 inflamed scaly skin with fluid-filled blisters that may become infected and produce a foul-smelling skin odour lamellar ichthyosis \u2013 where the skin isn't as red, but the scales are larger and tighter to the skin In severe cases of congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma a child may also have drooping lower eyelids (ectropion), mild hair loss and tight skin on the fingers. Acquired ichthyosis Acquired ichthyosis tends to develop in adulthood and isn't inherited. It's usually associated with another condition, such as: an underactive thyroid kidney disease sarcoidosis \u2013 a rare condition that causes small patches of red swollen tissue to develop in the body's organs Hodgkin lymphoma \u2013 a rare type of cancer HIV infection Certain medications can also trigger ichthyosis, including some medications used in targeted cancer therapy, such as vemurafenib and protein kinase inhibitors. Treating ichthyosis There's no cure for ichthyosis, but moisturising and exfoliating the skin daily can help prevent dryness, scaling and the build-up of skin cells. Skincare  Your skin specialist (dermatologist) will be able to prescribe or recommend suitable moisturising treatments (emollients), which may be in the form of a cream, ointment, lotion or bath oil. You should: apply emollients to wet skin to trap the moisture \u2013 ideally a few minutes after having a bath or shower gently rub wet skin with a pumice stone to remove some of the thickened skin brush washed hair to remove scales from your scalp Other useful exfoliating or moisturising products include lanolin creams, products containing urea, propylene glycol, lactic acid, and other alpha hydroxy acids. Your dermatologist may also recommend peeling creams, such as salicylic acid, to help exfoliate and moisturise your skin. However, some people may find these products irritate their skin. Antibiotics or antiseptics may be prescribed to treat skin infections. Steroid treatments aren't effective for treating ichthyosis. Severe ichthyosis People with severe ichthyosis may need to spend several hours a day caring for their skin. They may have the following problems: overheating \u2013 as a result of a reduced ability to sweat limited movement \u2013 dry skin can make it too painful to move certain parts of the body skin infection \u2013 after cracking and splitting of the skin impaired hearing or eyesight \u2013 if skin builds up over the ears or eyes People with severe ichthyosis may be prescribed retinoid tablets (synthetic vitamin A), which reduce the growth of overactive scaly skin. They improve the skin's appearance, but don't improve the inflammation or redness. Vitamin D supplements may also be prescribed. Outlook People with mild ichthyosis have a normal lifespan. However, the most severe inherited types can be life threatening. If you have inherited ichthyosis, you'll have it for life. Acquired ichthyosis may get better if the underlying cause is identified and treated. National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service If you or your child has ichthyosis, your clinical team may ask you for permission to pass information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). The NCARDRS helps scientists identify more effective ways of treating and preventing rare conditions, such as ichthyosis. You can opt out of the register at any time.

It can have many possible causes, including conditions such as narcolepsy, sleep apnoea or restless legs syndrome; severe sleep deprivation; depression; certain medications (such as tranquillisers); or drug and alcohol misuse. However, some people with hypersomnia will not have an underlying medical condition and there will be no obvious explanation for it \u2013 they have it throughout the day, despite sleeping for a very long time at night. This is known as \"idiopathic\" or primary hypersomnia. The rest of this page focuses on idiopathic hypersomnia.  Signs and symptoms People with idiopathic hypersomnia struggle to stay awake during the day and are usually compelled to take frequent long naps. These may be prolonged or at inappropriate times \u2013 such as during a conversation or meal, or even while driving \u2013 and generally don't provide any relief from the sleepiness. Most people with idiopathic hypersomnia also sleep for more than 10 hours a night and struggle to wake in the morning, because they feel very drowsy and confused upon waking (\"sleep drunkenness\"), although some people sleep for a regular amount of time (about eight hours) and are able to wake relatively normally. The excessive sleepiness may have a negative impact on the person's work, relationships and social life, and they may also: have mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression  have low energy be restless or agitated think or speak slowly have trouble remembering things or maintaining concentration perform behaviours around the house as if on \u201Cautopilot\u201D These symptoms often develop during adolescence or in a person's early twenties, although they can occur earlier or later in life. What to do See your GP if you're constantly drowsy during the day and it's affecting your everyday life. They'll want to know about your sleeping habits, how much sleep you get at night, if you wake during the night, and whether you fall asleep during the day. They will also want to know if you have any emotional problems, such as depression, or if you're taking any medication that could explain your hypersomnia. Your GP may also suggest keeping a diary of your sleeping patterns and sleepiness levels for a few weeks, or filling in a questionnaire called the Epworth sleepiness scale to assess whether you're excessively sleepy during the day. If necessary, your GP can refer you to a doctor specialising in sleep disorders for tests to help diagnose the cause of your symptoms. Seeing a sleep specialist A number of tests can be carried out to assess your sleep and help identify any underlying cause. These are usually carried out at a specialist sleep centre. Two of the main tests used are: Polysomnography (a night time sleep test), which will help rule out sleep disorders such as narcolepsy or sleep apnoea. You stay in a special bedroom and are observed from another room through the night. Electrodes are attached to your face, head and body to record brainwaves, muscle activity, eye movement, breathing and snoring.  Multiple sleep latency test \u2013 this test usually follows the next day. You'll be asked to take several naps throughout the day, so doctors can see how long it takes you to fall asleep when instructed (this shouldn't take longer than eight minutes for someone with hypersomnia). Doctors may diagnose idiopathic hypersomnia if you have excessive daytime sleepiness and need regular daytime naps, but no other cause is found. Managing idiopathic hypersomnia Idiopathic hypersomnia doesn't usually get better by itself. Many people find that the symptoms improve with treatment. Medication There are no medicines specifically designed to treat idiopathic hypersomnia, but medications used for narcolepsy can often help. The main medications used are stimulants, such as modafinil, dexamphetamine and methylphenidate, which help to keep you awake during the day. See treating narcolepsy for more information on these medicines. Antidepressants may be prescribed if emotional problems are interfering with your sleep. A medicine called flumazenil has been shown to help some patients with idiopathic hypersomnia, although more research is needed to be sure of its effectiveness. Lifestyle changes It may also help to adopt good sleeping habits, such as avoiding alcohol, caffeine and medications that make the condition worse, sticking to a bedtime routine, and avoiding working at night or engaging in social activities that delay bedtime. Idiopathic hypersomnia or narcolepsy? Idiopathic hypersomnia is similar to narcolepsy, in that both cause excessive daytime sleepiness and can mean you fall asleep at virtually any time, but there are some key differences:  In narcolepsy, you may lose muscle control when experiencing strong emotions (cataplexy) \u2013 this does not happen in idiopathic hypersomnia. People with narcolepsy often have very vivid dreams and even hallucinations when they are drowsy, which are generally not seen in idiopathic hypersomnia. The overnight sleep in narcolepsy is usually very fragmented and of poor quality, but people with idiopathic hypersomnia tend to sleep continuously through the night. Short daytime naps in narcolepsy tend to be refreshing, but naps in idiopathic hypersomnia are more like long sleeps and are not refreshing. In idiopathic hypersomnia, you don't tend to fall quickly into rapid eye movement (REM) or dream sleep, which is often a key feature in narcolepsy.

The opening is known as a stoma. A special bag is placed over the stoma to collect waste products that usually pass through the colon (large intestine) and out of the body through the rectum and back passage (anus). Ileostomy procedures are relatively common in the UK. More than 9,000 are carried out each year in England. When is an ileostomy needed? Ileostomies are formed to either temporarily or permanently stop digestive waste passing through the full length of the small intestine or colon. There are a number of reasons why this may be necessary, including: to allow the small intestine or colon to heal after it's been operated on \u2013 for example, if a section of bowel has been removed to treat bowel cancer to relieve inflammation of the colon in people with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis to allow for complex surgery to be carried out on the anus or rectum Read more about why ileostomy procedures are carried out. The ileostomy procedure Before an ileostomy is formed, you'll normally see a specialist stoma nurse to discuss exactly where you'd like your stoma to be (usually somewhere on the right-hand side of the abdomen) and to talk about living with a stoma. There are two main types of ileostomy: loop ileostomy \u2013 where a loop of small intestine is pulled out through a cut (incision) in your abdomen, before being opened up and stitched to the skin to form a stoma end ileostomy \u2013 where the ileum is separated from the colon and is brought out through the abdomen to form a stoma Alternatively, it's sometimes possible for an internal pouch to be created that's connected to your anus (ileo-anal pouch). This means there's no stoma and stools are passed out of your back passage in a similar way to normal. End ileostomies and ileo-anal pouches are usually permanent. Loop ileostomies are usually intended to be temporary and can be reversed during an operation at a later date. Read more about: How an ileostomy is formed  Reversing an ileostomy After surgery You may need to stay in hospital for up to two weeks after an ileostomy operation. During this time you'll be taught how to look after your stoma by a specialist stoma nurse. Recovering from the procedure can be challenging. Many people experience short-term physical and psychological problems, ranging from skin irritation around the stoma to feelings of anxiety and self-consciousness. However, with practise and support from a designated stoma nurse, many people adjust and often find their quality of life improves after surgery. This is especially true if they've been living for years with a condition such as Crohn's disease. Read more about: Recovering from an ileostomy procedure Living with an ileostomy Complications As with any surgical procedure, having an ileostomy carries a risk of complications. Some of the problems people with an ileostomy experience include: a bowel obstruction \u2013 where the output of digestive waste is blocked vitamin B12 deficiency \u2013 caused by the removal of part of the intestine that absorbs vitamin B12 stoma problems \u2013 such as widening or narrowing of the stoma, making it difficult to attach the external bag Read more about the risks of having an ileostomy.

It's also known as the \"pneumo jab\" or pneumonia vaccine. Pneumococcal infections are caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae and can lead to pneumonia, septicaemia (a kind of blood poisoning) and meningitis. At their worst, they can cause permanent brain damage, or even kill. This page covers: Who should have the pneumococcal vaccine How often is the pneumococcal vaccine given The different types of pneumococcal vaccine How the pneumococcal vaccine works Who shouldn't have the pneumococcal vaccine Side effects of the pneumococcal vaccine Who should have the pneumococcal vaccine? A pneumococcal infection can affect anyone. However, some people are at higher risk of serious illness and can be given the pneumococcal vaccination on the NHS. These include: babies  adults aged 65 or over children and adults with certain long-term health conditions, such as a serious heart or kidney condition Read more about who should have the pneumo jab. How often is the pneumococcal vaccine given? Babies receive the pneumococcal vaccine as three separate injections, at 8 weeks, 16 weeks and one year old. People over 65 only need a single pneumococcal vaccination, which will protect for life. It is not given annually like the flu jab. People with a long-term health condition may need just a single one-off pneumococcal vaccination or five-yearly vaccination, depending on their underlying health problem. The different types of pneumonia vaccine The type of pneumococcal vaccine you are given depends on your age and health. The two types are: pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) \u2013 this is used to vaccinate children under two years old as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. It's known by the brand name Prevenar 13. Read the patient information leaflet for Prevenar 13. pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) \u2013 this is given to people aged 65 and over, and to people at high risk due to long-term health conditions. Read the patient information leaflet for PPV.  Children at risk of pneumococcal infections can have the PPV vaccine from the age of two years onwards. It's thought not to work in children under the age of two.  How the pneumococcal vaccine works Both types of pneumococcal vaccine encourage your body to produce antibodies against pneumococcal bacteria. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body to neutralise or destroy disease-carrying organisms and toxins. They protect you from becoming ill if you are infected with the bacteria. More than 90 different strains of the pneumococcal bacterium have been identified, though only 8 to 10 of them cause the most serious infections. The childhood vaccine (PCV) protects against 13 strains of the pneumococcal bacterium, while the adult vaccine (PPV) protects against 23 strains. The pneumococcal vaccine is thought to be around 50-70% effective at preventing pneumococcal disease. Both the PPV and the PCV are inactivated or \"killed\" vaccines and do not contain any live organisms. They cannot cause the disease against which they protect.  Read more about killed vaccines. Who shouldn't have the pneumo jab? Occasionally, you or your child may need to delay having the vaccination or avoid it completely because of the following: Vaccine allergy Tell your GP if you or your child has had a bad reaction to any vaccination in the past. If there's been a confirmed severe allergic reaction, called an anaphylactic reaction, to the pneumococcal vaccine or any ingredient in the vaccine, it's best to avoid having it. However, if it was only a mild reaction, such as a rash, it is generally safe to have the vaccine. Fever at the vaccination appointment If you or your child are mildly unwell at the time of the vaccination, it's safe to have the vaccine. However, if you or your child are more seriously ill \u2013 for example, with a high temperature \u2013 it's best to delay the vaccination until after recovery.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding It's thought to be safe to have the pneumococcal vaccine during pregnancy and while you're breastfeeding. But, as a precaution, if you are pregnant, you may want to wait until you have had your baby (unless the benefits of having the vaccine outweigh the risks to your child). Side effects of the pneumococcal vaccine Like most vaccines, the childhood and adult versions of the pneumococcal vaccine can sometimes cause mild side effects, including: a mild fever redness at the site of the injection hardness or swelling at the site of the injection There are no serious side effects listed for either the childhood or adult versions of the vaccine, apart from an extremely small risk of serious allergic reaction. Read about the side effects of the pneumococcal vaccination. This video tells the story of 11-year-old Sam, who had pneumococcal meningitis as a baby (before the childhood pneumococcal vaccine was introduced) and was left severely brain damaged.

It's not usually serious and often improves within a week of treatment or within a few weeks without treatment. Impetigo is the most common skin infection in young children in the UK, but it can affect people of all ages. This topic covers: Symptoms When to seek medical advice Causes Treatment Preventing the spread of impetigo Preventing recurrent impetigo Complications Symptoms of impetigo  There are two types of impetigo: non-bullous impetigo \u2013 the most common type bullous impetigo The symptoms of both types are described below. Non-bullous impetigo The symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores \u2013 usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected. The sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. The appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin. After the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually fades without scarring. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks. The sores aren't painful, but they may be itchy. It's important not to touch or scratch the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of the body, and to other people. Other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and swollen glands, are rare but can occur in more severe cases. Bullous impetigo The symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the central part of the body between the waist and neck, or on the arms and legs. The blisters are usually about 1-2cm across. The blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring. The blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. As with non-bullous impetigo, it's important not to touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin. Symptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo. When to seek medical advice Speak to your GP if you think you or your child may have symptoms of impetigo. Impetigo isn't usually serious, but it can sometimes have similar symptoms to more serious conditions such as cellulitis (an infection of the deeper layers of skin) so it's important to get a correct diagnosis. Your GP can also prescribe treatment to help clear up the infection more quickly than if it was left untreated. Causes of impetigo Impetigo occurs when the skin becomes infected with bacteria, usually either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. The bacteria can infect the skin in two main ways: through a break in otherwise healthy skin \u2013 such as a cut, insect bite or other injury \u2013 this is known as primary impetigo through skin damaged by another underlying skin condition, such as head lice, scabies or eczema \u2013 this is known as secondary impetigo The bacteria can be spread easily through close contact with someone who has the infection, such as through direct physical contact, or by sharing towels or flannels. As the condition doesn't cause any symptoms until four to 10 days after initial exposure to the bacteria, it's often easily spread to others unintentionally. Children and people with diabetes or a weakened immune system \u2013 either due to a condition such as HIV or a treatment such as chemotherapy \u2013 are most at risk of developing impetigo. Treating impetigo Impetigo usually gets better without treatment in around two to three weeks. However, treatment is often recommended because it can reduce the length of the illness to around seven to 10 days and can lower the risk of the infection being spread to others. The main treatments prescribed are antibiotic creams or antibiotic tablets. These usually have to be used for around a week. Read about treating impetigo. Preventing the spread of impetigo During treatment, it's important to take precautions to minimise the risk of impetigo spreading to other people or to other areas of the body. Most people are no longer contagious after 48 hours of treatment or once their sores have dried and healed. It's important to stay away from work, school, nursery or playgroup until this point. The advice below can also help to prevent the spread of the infection: don't share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo \u2013 wash them at a high temperature after use wash the sores with soap and water and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing avoid touching or scratching the sores, or letting others touch them \u2013 it may help to ensure your nails are kept clean and short avoid contact with newborn babies, preparing food, playing contact sports, or going to the gym \u2013 until the risk of infection has passed wash your hands frequently \u2013 particularly after touching infected skin washable toys should also be washed \u2013 wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completely If you think that the infection has spread to someone else, make sure they're seen by a GP as soon as possible. Preventing recurrent impetigo To reduce the risk of impetigo returning, make sure any cuts, scratches or bites are kept clean. Ensure any condition that causes broken skin, such as eczema, is treated promptly. If you develop impetigo frequently, your doctor may suggest taking a swab from around your nose to see if you carry staphylococcal bacteria. These bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, although they can lead to impetigo if they infect broken skin nearby. If you're found to carry these bacteria, you may be prescribed an antiseptic nasal cream to apply several times a day for five to 10 days in an attempt to clear the bacteria and reduce the chances of impetigo recurring. Complications of impetigo Complications of impetigo are rare, but they can sometimes occur and can be serious. Tell your GP if you have impetigo and your symptoms change or get worse. Some complications associated with impetigo include: cellulitis \u2013 an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue scarlet fever \u2013 a rare bacterial infection that causes a fine, pink rash across the body guttate psoriasis \u2013 a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a bacterial infection septicaemia (a type of sepsis) \u2013 a bacterial infection of the blood Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) \u2013 a serious skin condition that looks like the skin has been scalded with boiling water post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis \u2013 an infection of the small blood vessels in the kidneys In very rare cases, impetigo may lead to some scarring, particularly if you scratch at the blisters, crusts or sores.

It involves the rotator cuff tendon \u2013 a tough, rubbery cord that connects the muscles in your shoulder to the top of your arm. The tendon and muscle run through a narrow space at the top of the shoulder called the subacromial space. In shoulder impingement syndrome, the tendon becomes trapped in this space and repeatedly scrapes against the bone above, causing pain that tends to be worse when you raise your arm over your head. You may also experience a persistent ache in your shoulder and pain at night. Shoulder impingement syndrome can start suddenly after an injury, or (generally from middle age onwards) it can come on gradually without any obvious cause. What causes shoulder impingement syndrome? The subacromial space is naturally quite narrow, especially when the arm is raised. Anything that further narrows this space can cause the tendon to become trapped. Possible causes include: bone spurs under the bony roof (acromion) at the top of the subacromial space can narrow the space and catch on the tendon swelling or thickening of the rotator cuff tendon \u2013 which may result from an injury or general overuse of the shoulder inflammation of the fluid-filled sac (bursa) that lies between the rotator cuff tendon and acromion (known as \"bursitis\") a build-up of calcium deposits within the rotator cuff tendon Seeking medical advice See your GP if you have persistent shoulder pain. They should be able to diagnose shoulder impingement syndrome by asking about your symptoms and examining your shoulder. You may also be asked to do some specific arm movements to help them work out the cause of your pain. If the cause of your pain is unclear, your GP may refer you for a specialist assessment by a shoulder surgeon, who may also carry out some scans of your shoulder. This can help to rule out other possible causes of shoulder pain. Treating shoulder impingement syndrome Caring for your shoulder at home If shoulder impingement syndrome is only mild, the following measures may be all that are needed: Rest the tendon \u2013 Avoiding any overarm movements will help prevent any further inflammation (swelling) or damage. Your doctor or physiotherapist will tell you how long you should rest it for, and when you should start exercises (see below). Ice packs \u2013 Holding an ice pack to the shoulder for around 20 minutes several times a day may help to ease the pain. Don't put ice directly on your skin \u2013 wrap it in a towel. If you don't have an ice pack, try ice cubes or a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel. Painkillers \u2013 Mild non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can provide short-term pain relief and are available as tablets or a gel that you apply to the shoulder. Other painkillers, such as paracetamol, may also help to ease the pain. If your pain is more severe, a stronger painkiller such as codeine can be prescribed. Exercises While it's important to rest the shoulder joint, you shouldn't stop movement altogether. Inactivity will cause the muscles to weaken, which will worsen the problem and cause your shoulder to stiffen up. For this reason, a sling is not usually recommended. Your GP may refer you to a physiotherapist, who will be able to recommend some arm exercises to help stretch and strengthen your shoulder, and improve your range of movement. After an initial period of supervision by a physiotherapist, you will usually be able to continue doing these exercises at home. Read more about physiotherapy. Corticosteroid injections Corticosteroids are medications that can be used to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. If there is swelling and evidence of inflammation in your shoulder, corticosteroids can be injected directly into the affected area. They may also be combined with local anaesthetic to further help relieve your pain. Although corticosteroid injections can relieve pain, without physiotherapy they do not have a long-term effect, and it's common for the pain to return. You can sometimes have another injection, but you will need to wait at least six weeks. Usually, no more than one to two injections into the same area are recommended. Possible side effects of corticosteroid injections include thinning and lightening of the skin. Surgery If the treatments above aren't effective, you may need an operation to widen the subacromial space in your shoulder, so the rotator cuff tendon is no longer rubbing against the bone above. This is known as subacromial decompression. This can usually be done using a technique called arthroscopy, which is a type of keyhole surgery carried out under general anaesthetic, where special surgical instruments and a thin, flexible tube containing a camera are inserted through small cuts in your skin. This means you should recover faster and with less scarring than if a larger cut was made. Most people are able to go home the same day or the day after. This technique can also be used to remove any calcium deposits that have formed in the tendon in your shoulder.

It can be expensive, the results aren't guaranteed, and there are risks to weigh up. It involves inserting breast implants to increase the size of the breasts, change their shape, or make them more even. But before you go ahead, be absolutely sure about why you want them. Take time to reflect on your decision. It may help to read our article Is cosmetic surgery right for me? and to discuss it with your GP first. Read on to find out: How much does it cost? Where do I go? What does it involve? Choosing your implants  How long do breast implants last? Recovery Side effects to expect What could go wrong What to do if you have problems   More information How much does it cost? In the UK, breast implant surgery costs around £3,500-£7,000, plus the cost of any consultations or follow-up care that may not be included in the price. If there is a problem with the implant and it has to be removed, you'll usually need to pay for any replacement and further surgery yourself. Where do I go? If you're looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform the operation.  All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC. The CQC publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. Also, research the surgeon who is going to fit your breast implants. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor's fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many operations they've performed where there have been complications what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong their own patient satisfaction rates Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? Breast implant surgery is carried out under general anaesthetic. The operation involves: making a cut (incision) in the skin next to or below the breast positioning the implant \u2013 either between your breast tissue and chest muscle, or behind your chest muscle stitching the incision and covering it with a dressing The operation takes between 60 and 90 minutes. You may be able to go home the same day, but may need to stay in hospital overnight if the operation was scheduled late in the day. Pain relief is provided if you experience any discomfort afterwards. Choosing your implants The type of implants most commonly used in the UK are silicone gel, but saline implants are also available. Your surgeon should discuss with you what shape and type of implant is best for you, but below is a rough guide. Silicone gel implants These are filled with either soft or firm silicone gel. Implants filled with the firmer gel are called cohesive gel implants. Some have a polyurethane coating.  Pros: Generally less likely to wrinkle than saline implants. The soft type can give a natural feel. Polyurethane-coated ones are claimed to reduce the risk of capsular contracture and the implant rotating \u2013 see What could go wrong. Cons: If a soft gel implant ruptures, silicone could spread into your breast and cause siliconomas \u2013 see What could go wrong. This is much less of an issue if cohesive implants are used, but this firmer gel may not feel as natural. Polyurethane-coated ones may cause a temporary skin reaction. Saline solution implants  Pros: If the implant were to rupture, the saline solution would be safely absorbed or passed out of your body.   Cons: More likely to rupture or deflate earlier than silicone, as they tend to slowly deflate over time. More prone to wrinkling or folding. May feel less natural than soft silicone. Where to place them The implants can either be placed between the breast and the chest muscle or behind the muscle. You'll need to decide with your surgeon where is best for you, but here's a rough guide. Between the breast and the muscle: most natural location less discomfort immediately after the operation chest muscle is not damaged Under the muscle: extra tissue coverage less risk of rippling and capsular contracture \u2013 see What could go wrong How long do breast implants last? Breast implants will not last a lifetime. They are likely to need replacing at some point. Some women may need further surgery after about 10 years, either because of problems with the implants or because their breasts have changed around the implants. Recovery It can take a few weeks to fully recover from breast implant surgery. You may need to take a week or two off work and shouldn't drive for at least one week. Some surgeons recommend wearing a sports bra 24 hours a day for up to three months after breast surgery. You'd need to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous exercise for at least a month, and keep your breast scars out of direct sunlight for about a year. After a week or two: Stitches would be removed (unless you had dissolvable stitches). Within six weeks: You'd usually be able to return to most of your normal activities. After a few months: Your breasts would usually start to look and feel more natural. You may be able to stop wearing your sports bra. Side effects to expect It's fairly common after breast implant surgery to have:  temporary pain, swelling and bruising a tight feeling in your chest for a few weeks   What could go wrong Breast implants can occasionally result in problems, including: thick, obvious scarring the breast tissue feeling hard because scar tissue has shrunk around the implant (capsular contracture) a ruptured implant \u2013 this may cause small tender lumps (siliconomas) only detectable on breast scans, and the implant will need to be removed creases or folds in the implant the implant rotating within the breast, which may lead to an abnormal shape 'rippling' of the implant \u2013 this occurs when the implant is covered by only a thin layer of tissue, which sticks to the implant surface and is very difficult to treat nerve problems in the nipples \u2013 they may become more sensitive, less sensitive, or completely desensitised; this can be temporary or permanent not being able to breastfeed or producing slightly less breast milk than you would without implants \u2013 your baby won't be harmed if you breastfeed with implants Also, any type of operation carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding infection \u2013 this is rare, but may mean the implant needs to be removed an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic a blood clot forming in the deep veins You should also be aware of a possible link between breast implants and a rare type of immune system cell cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). ALCL has been reported in a very small number of women who have had breast implants. So far, it has only been found in scar tissue that develops around textured breast implants. The surgeon should explain how likely all these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, people find the desired effect wasn't achieved and feel they need another operation. Mammograms after implants Mammograms for breast cancer screening are less accurate if you have implants, so it's important you tell the radiographer about them. It's safe to have mammograms and they do not cause implants to rupture. They may reveal an implant that has ruptured. What to do if you have problems Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms, such as redness of your breast skin, a burning sensation or unusual swelling. If you experience a problem with your breast implants, you can report this through the government's Yellow Card Scheme. By reporting any issues, you are helping to provide more information on the safety of the implants. If you are not happy with the results or think the procedure wasn't carried out properly, you should take up the matter with your surgeon through the hospital or clinic where you were treated. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC). Breast implant registry By June 2016, everyone who has a breast enlargement operation in England will be able to have their breast implants recorded on a national registry.  This measure has been introduced following the 2010 PIP implant scandal, when many women were unable to find out whether they had been given the faulty implants. This registry is designed to capture all breast implant surgery carried out both privately and by the NHS, so patients can be easily traced if implants ever need to be recalled and removed. Talk to your surgeon if you want data about your implants to be stored. Find out more about the registry.

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: Contraceptive implant A woman can get pregnant if a man\u2019s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method is the implant. At a glance: facts about the contraceptive implant   How it works   Who can use it   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks   Where you can get it The contraceptive implant is a small flexible tube about 40mm long that's inserted under the skin of your upper arm. It's inserted by a trained professional, such as a doctor, and lasts for three years.  The implant stops the release of an egg from the ovary by slowly releasing progestogen into your body. Progestogen also thickens the cervical mucus and thins the womb lining. This makes it harder for sperm to move through your cervix, and less likely for your womb to accept a fertilised egg. At a glance: the implant If implanted correctly, it's more than 99% effective. Fewer than one woman in 1,000 who have the implant as contraception for three years will get pregnant. It's very useful for women who know they don't want to get pregnant for a while. Once the implant is in place, you don't have to think about contraception for three years.  It can be useful for women who can't use contraception that contains oestrogen.  It's very useful for women who find it difficult to take a pill at the same time every day.  If you have side effects, the implant can be taken out. You can have the implant removed at any time, and your natural fertility will return very quickly. When it's first put in, you may feel some bruising, tenderness or swelling around the implant.  In the first year after the implant is fitted, your periods may become irregular, lighter, heavier or longer. This usually settles down after the first year.  A common side effect of the implant is that your periods stop (amenorrhoea). It's not harmful, but you may want to consider this before deciding to have an implant.  Some medications can make the implant less effective, and additional contraceptive precautions need to be followed when you are taking these medications (see Will other medicines affect the implant?). The implant does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using condoms as well as the implant, you'll help to protect yourself against STIs. How the implant works The implant steadily releases the hormone progestogen into your bloodstream. Progestogen is similar to the natural hormone progesterone, which is released by a woman's ovaries during her period. The continuous release of progestogen: stops a woman releasing an egg every month (ovulation)  thickens the mucus from the cervix (entrance to the womb), making it difficult for sperm to pass through to the womb and reach an unfertilised egg makes the lining of the womb thinner so that it is unable to support a fertilised egg You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you The implant can be put in at any time during your menstrual cycle, as long as you and your doctor are reasonably sure you are not pregnant. In the UK, Nexplanon is the main contraceptive implant currently in use. Implants inserted before October 2010 were called Implanon. Since October 2010, insertion of Implanon has decreased as stocks are used up, and Nexplanon has become the most commonly used implant. Both types of implant work in the same way, but Nexplanon is designed to reduce the risk of insertion errors and is visible on an X-ray or CT (computerised tomography) scan. There is no need for existing Implanon users to have their implant removed and replaced by Nexplanon ahead of its usual replacement time. Nexplanon is a small, thin, flexible tube about 4cm long. It is implanted under the skin of your upper arm by a doctor or nurse. A local anaesthetic is used to numb the area. The small wound made in your arm is closed with a dressing and does not need stitches. Nexplanon works for up to three years before it needs to be replaced. You can continue to use it until you reach the menopause, when a woman\u2019s monthly periods stop (at around 52 years of age). The implant can be removed at any time by a specially trained doctor or nurse. It only takes a few minutes to remove, using a local anaesthetic. As soon as the implant has been removed, you will no longer be protected against pregnancy. When it starts to work If the implant is fitted during the first five days of your menstrual cycle, you will be immediately protected against becoming pregnant. If it is fitted on any other day of your menstrual cycle, you will not be protected against pregnancy for up to seven days, and should use another method, such as condoms.   After giving birth You can have the contraceptive implant fitted after you have given birth, usually after three weeks. If it is fitted on or before day 21 after the birth, you will be immediately protected against becoming pregnant.  If it is fitted after day 21, you will need to use additional contraception, such as condoms, for the following seven days. It is safe to use the implant while you are breastfeeding. After a miscarriage or abortion The implant can be fitted immediately after a miscarriage or an abortion, and you will be protected against pregnancy straight away. Who can use the implant Most women can be fitted with the contraceptive implant. It may not be suitable if you: think you might be pregnant want to keep having regular periods  have bleeding in between periods or after sex have arterial disease or a history of heart disease or stroke have a blood clot in a blood vessel (thrombosis) have liver disease  have migraines have breast cancer or have had it in the past have diabetes with complications have cirrhosis or liver tumours are at risk of osteoporosis   Advantages and disadvantages of the implant The main advantages of the contraceptive implant are: it works for three years the implant does not interrupt sex it is an option if you cannot use oestrogen-based contraception, such as the combined contraceptive pill, contraceptive patch or vaginal ring you do not have to remember to take a pill every day the implant is safe to use while you are breastfeeding your fertility should return to normal as soon as the implant is removed implants offer some protection against pelvic inflammatory disease (the mucus from the cervix may stop bacteria entering the womb) and may also give some protection against cancer of the womb the implant may reduce heavy periods or painful periods after the first year of use after the contraceptive implant has been inserted, you should be able to carry out normal activities Using a contraceptive implant may have some disadvantages, which you should consider carefully before deciding on the right method of contraception for you. These include: Disrupted periods Your periods may change significantly while using a contraceptive implant. Around 20% of women using the implant will have no bleeding, and almost 50% will have infrequent or prolonged bleeding. Bleeding patterns are likely to remain irregular, although they may settle down after the first year. Although these changes are not harmful, they may not be acceptable for some women. Your GP may be able to help by providing additional medication if you have prolonged bleeding. Other side effects that some women report are: headaches acne nausea breast tenderness changes in mood loss of sex drive These side effects usually stop after the first few months. If you have prolonged or severe headaches or other side effects, tell your doctor. Some women put on weight while using the implant, but there is no evidence to show that the implant causes weight gain. Will other medicines affect the implant? Some medicines can reduce the implant's effectiveness. These include: medication for HIV medication for epilepsy complementary remedies, such as St John's Wort an antibiotic called rifabutin (which can be used to treat tuberculosis) an antibiotic called rifampicin (which can be used to treat several conditions, including tuberculosis and meningitis) These are called enzyme-inducing drugs. If you are using these medicines for a short while (for example, rifampicin to protect against meningitis), it is recommended that you use additional contraception during the course of treatment and for 28 days afterwards. The additional contraception could be condoms, or a single dose of the contraceptive injection. The implant can remain in place if you have the injection. Women taking enzyme-inducing drugs in the long term may wish to consider using a method of contraception that isn't affected by their medication. Always tell your doctor that you are using an implant if you are prescribed any medicines. Ask your doctor or nurse for more details about the implant and other medication. Risks of the implant In rare cases, the area of skin where the implant has been fitted can become infected. If this happens, the area will be cleaned and may be treated with antibiotics. Where you can get the contraceptive implant Most types of contraception are available for free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics sexual health clinics \u2013 they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people\u2019s services (call 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching by postcode or town. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won't tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.

Erectile dysfunction is a very common condition, particularly in older men. It is estimated that half of all men between the ages of 40 and 70 will have it to some degree. When to see your GP See your GP if you have erectile dysfunction for more than a few weeks. They will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such as heart disease (when the heart\u2019s blood supply is blocked or interrupted). Why does erectile dysfunction happen? Erectile dysfunction can have a range of causes, both physical and psychological. Physical causes include: narrowing of the blood vessels going to the penis \u2013 commonly associated with high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol or diabetes hormonal problems surgery or injury Psychological causes of ED include: anxiety  depression  relationship problems Sometimes erectile dysfunction only occurs in certain situations. For example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner. If this is the case, it is likely the underlying cause of erectile dysfunction is psychological (stress related). If you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is physical. Erectile dysfunction can also be a side-effect of using certain medicines. Read more about the causes of erectile dysfunction. Diagnosis Although you may be embarrassed, it's important to get a diagnosis so that the cause can be identified. Your GP can usually diagnose erectile dysfunction. This will involve answering questions about your symptoms, as well as a physical examination and some simple tests. Read more about diagnosing erectile dysfunction. How is erectile dysfunction treated? Erectile dysfunction is primarily treated by tackling the cause of the problem, whether this is physical or psychological. The narrowing of the arteries (called atherosclerosis) is one of the most common causes of ED. In these cases your GP may suggest lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, to try to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease.

It is a common problem and is thought to affect millions of people worldwide. It's not clear exactly how many people are affected, but it's estimated that between 3 and 6 million people in the UK may have some degree of urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence affects both men and women, but it tends to be more common in women overall. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of urinary incontinence depend on the type you have. There are several types of urinary incontinence, but the most common are: stress incontinence \u2013 when urine leaks out at times when your bladder is under pressure, for example when you cough or laugh urge incontinence \u2013 when urine leaks as you feel a sudden, intense urge to pass urine, or soon afterwards It is also possible to have a mixture of both stress and urge urinary incontinence. Read more about the symptoms of urinary incontinence. What causes urinary incontinence? The causes of urinary incontinence depend on the type. Stress incontinence is usually the result of the weakening or damaging of the muscles used to prevent urination, such as the pelvic floor muscles and the urethral sphincter. Urge incontinence is usually the result of overactivity of the detrusor muscles, which control the bladder. Certain things can increase the chances of urinary incontinence developing, including: pregnancy and vaginal birth obesity a family history of incontinence increasing age \u2013 although incontinence is not an inevitable part of ageing Read more about the causes of urinary incontinence. Seeking medical advice Although you may feel embarrassed talking to someone about your symptoms, it's a good idea to see your GP if you have any type of urinary incontinence as this can be the first step towards finding a way to effectively manage the problem. Urinary incontinence can usually be diagnosed after a consultation with your GP, who will ask about your symptoms and may carry out a pelvic examination (in women) or rectal examination (in men). Your GP may also suggest you keep a diary in which you note how much fluid you drink and how often you have to urinate. Read more about diagnosing urinary incontinence. How urinary incontinence is treated Initially, your GP may suggest some simple measures to see if they help improve your symptoms. These may include: lifestyle changes, such as losing weight and cutting down on caffeine and alcohol pelvic floor exercises (exercising your pelvic floor muscles by squeezing them) taught by a specialist  bladder training (where you learn ways to help you can wait longer between needing to urinate and passing urine) guided by a specialist You may also benefit from the use of incontinence products, such as absorbent pads and hand-held urinals (urine collection bottles). If you are still unable to manage your symptoms, medication may be recommended.  Surgery may also be considered. The specific procedures suitable for you will depend on the type of incontinence you have. Surgical treatments for stress incontinence, such as tape or sling procedures, are used to reduce pressure on the bladder, or strengthen the muscles that control urination. Operations to treat urge incontinence include enlarging the bladder or implanting a device that stimulates the nerve that controls the detrusor muscles. Read more about non-surgical treatments for urinary incontinence and surgery and procedures for urinary incontinence. Preventing urinary incontinence It is not always possible to prevent urinary incontinence, but there are some steps you can take that may help reduce the chance of it developing, such as: controlling your weight avoiding or cutting down on alcohol keeping fit \u2013 in particular, ensuring that your pelvic floor muscles are strong Read more about preventing urinary incontinence.

Media last reviewed: 07\/05\/2015 Next review due: 07\/05\/2017 How we pass urine Urine passes from the kidneys through tubes called ureters to the bladder, where it is stored. The bladder is supported by pelvic floor muscles. Some of this muscle wraps around the urethra \u2013 the tube that runs from the bladder to outside the body \u2013 to help keep it closed until you need to pass urine. Once the bladder is full, a signal is sent to the brain that you need to pass urine. When you are ready, the brain tells the pelvic floor muscles to relax and open the urethra. The muscles around the bladder contract and push the urine out. A problem in any part of this process can result in urinary incontinence.

It is a common problem and is thought to affect millions of people worldwide. It's not clear exactly how many people are affected, but it's estimated that between 3 and 6 million people in the UK may have some degree of urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence affects both men and women, but it tends to be more common in women overall. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of urinary incontinence depend on the type you have. There are several types of urinary incontinence, but the most common are: stress incontinence \u2013 when urine leaks out at times when your bladder is under pressure, for example when you cough or laugh urge incontinence \u2013 when urine leaks as you feel a sudden, intense urge to pass urine, or soon afterwards It is also possible to have a mixture of both stress and urge urinary incontinence. Read more about the symptoms of urinary incontinence. What causes urinary incontinence? The causes of urinary incontinence depend on the type. Stress incontinence is usually the result of the weakening or damaging of the muscles used to prevent urination, such as the pelvic floor muscles and the urethral sphincter. Urge incontinence is usually the result of overactivity of the detrusor muscles, which control the bladder. Certain things can increase the chances of urinary incontinence developing, including: pregnancy and vaginal birth obesity a family history of incontinence increasing age \u2013 although incontinence is not an inevitable part of ageing Read more about the causes of urinary incontinence. Seeking medical advice Although you may feel embarrassed talking to someone about your symptoms, it's a good idea to see your GP if you have any type of urinary incontinence as this can be the first step towards finding a way to effectively manage the problem. Urinary incontinence can usually be diagnosed after a consultation with your GP, who will ask about your symptoms and may carry out a pelvic examination (in women) or rectal examination (in men). Your GP may also suggest you keep a diary in which you note how much fluid you drink and how often you have to urinate. Read more about diagnosing urinary incontinence. How urinary incontinence is treated Initially, your GP may suggest some simple measures to see if they help improve your symptoms. These may include: lifestyle changes, such as losing weight and cutting down on caffeine and alcohol pelvic floor exercises (exercising your pelvic floor muscles by squeezing them) taught by a specialist  bladder training (where you learn ways to help you can wait longer between needing to urinate and passing urine) guided by a specialist You may also benefit from the use of incontinence products, such as absorbent pads and hand-held urinals (urine collection bottles). If you are still unable to manage your symptoms, medication may be recommended.  Surgery may also be considered. The specific procedures suitable for you will depend on the type of incontinence you have. Surgical treatments for stress incontinence, such as tape or sling procedures, are used to reduce pressure on the bladder, or strengthen the muscles that control urination. Operations to treat urge incontinence include enlarging the bladder or implanting a device that stimulates the nerve that controls the detrusor muscles. Read more about non-surgical treatments for urinary incontinence and surgery and procedures for urinary incontinence.

Media last reviewed: 07\/05\/2015 Next review due: 07\/05\/2017 How we pass urine Urine passes from the kidneys through tubes called ureters to the bladder, where it is stored. The bladder is supported by pelvic floor muscles. Some of this muscle wraps around the urethra \u2013 the tube that runs from the bladder to outside the body \u2013 to help keep it closed until you need to pass urine. Once the bladder is full, a signal is sent to the brain that you need to pass urine. When you are ready, the brain tells the pelvic floor muscles to relax and open the urethra. The muscles around the bladder contract and push the urine out. A problem in any part of this process can result in urinary incontinence.

Dyspepsia and heartburn may occur together or on their own. Symptoms usually appear soon after eating or drinking. Common associated symptoms include: feeling full or bloated feeling sick (nausea) belching bringing up (regurgitating) fluid or food into the gullet (oesophagus) Indigestion is a common problem that affects many people, but in most cases it's mild and only occurs occasionally. Read more about the symptoms of indigestion. Why it happens Indigestion may be caused by stomach acid coming into contact with the sensitive, protective lining of the digestive system (mucosa). The stomach acid breaks down the lining, leading to irritation and inflammation, which can be painful. The majority of people with indigestion don't have inflammation in their digestive system. Therefore, their symptoms are thought to be caused by increased sensitivity of the mucosa (to acidity or stretching). In most cases indigestion is related to eating, although it can be triggered by other factors such as smoking, drinking, alcohol, pregnancy, stress or taking certain medications. Read more about the causes of indigestion. Treating indigestion at home Most people are able to treat indigestion with simple changes to their diet and lifestyle, or with a number of different medications, such as antacids. Read more about the treatment of indigestion. Read how to ease indigestion in pregnancy. Very rarely, a serious underlying health condition is the cause of indigestion. If this is suspected, then further investigation such as an endoscopy will be required (see below). When to see your doctor Most people will not need to seek medical advice for their indigestion. However, it is important to see your GP if you have recurring indigestion and any of the following apply: you are 55 years old or over you have lost a lot of weight without meaning to you have increasing difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) you have persistent vomiting you have iron deficiency anaemia you have a lump in your stomach you have blood in your vomit or blood in your stools This is because these symptoms may be a sign of an underlying health condition, such as a stomach ulcer or stomach cancer. You may need to be referred for an endoscopy to rule out any serious cause. An endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of the body is examined using an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube that has a light and camera on one end). Severe indigestion can cause long-term problems with parts of your digestive tract, such as scarring of the oesophagus or the passage from your stomach.

They're available over the counter from pharmacies and are often used to treat the symptoms of heartburn and indigestion. How antacids work Antacids counteract (neutralise) the acid in your stomach that's used to aid digestion. This helps reduce the symptoms of heartburn and relieves pain. Some antacids also coat the surface of the oesophagus (gullet) with a protective barrier against stomach acid, or produce a gel on the stomach\u2019s surface which helps stop acid leaking into the oesophagus and causing acid reflux. Different types of antacids Antacids are available in liquid form or as chewable tablets. They're sold under various brand names but contain common ingredients, including: aluminium hydroxide magnesium carbonate magnesium trisilicate Extra ingredients are sometimes added to help treat other problems, such as simeticone to relieve flatulence (wind), and alginates to prevent acid flowing into your oesophagus. Who can't take antacids? Antacids aren't suitable for everyone. For example, many antacids aren't recommended for children under the age of 12 and people with certain health conditions, such as kidney disease. Antacids can also interfere with other medications, so you may not be able to take them while you're being treated for another condition. Antacids are generally considered safe to take during pregnancy, but you should discuss it with your GP or pharmacist beforehand. Read more about who can't take antacid medicines. Possible side effects of antacids Like all medicines, antacids can have side effects. Common side effects include: diarrhoea constipation flatulence stomach cramps feeling sick or vomiting If you have diarrhoea or constipation after taking antacids it may be possible to switch to an alternative medicine. Speak to your GP or pharmacist for advice. Any side effects you experience while taking antacids should pass once you stop taking the medication. Visit your GP if they continue. Missed or extra doses When taking antacid medicines, follow the instructions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine or the advice of your GP or pharmacist. If you miss a dose, it won't usually be necessary to alter your next dose. It's likely that you can carry on taking your normal dose. However, for specific advice about what to do, refer to the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. Taking extra doses could cause several unpleasant side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation. Contact your GP or pharmacist immediately if you think that you've taken more antacids than you should have. Alternatively, you can call NHS 111 for advice.

The symptoms usually come on after eating food. Heartburn is a strong, burning pain in the chest caused by stomach acid passing from your stomach into your oesophagus (the tube that leads from your mouth to your stomach).  You can help ease the discomfort of indigestion and heartburn by making changes to your diet and lifestyle, and there are treatments that are safe to take in pregnancy. Talk to your midwife, GP or pharmacist. You can also find out more by reading this page or clicking on the links to go directly to the relevant information. Symptoms of indigestion Causes of indigestion in pregnancy Treatment for indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy Self-help tips for indigestion and heartburn Symptoms of indigestion in pregnancy Symptoms of indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy are the same as for anyone else with the condition. The main symptom is pain or a feeling of discomfort in your chest or stomach. This usually happens soon after eating or drinking, but there can sometimes be a delay between eating a meal and developing indigestion. You may experience indigestion at any point during your pregnancy, although your symptoms may be more frequent and severe during later pregnancy, from 27 weeks onwards. As well as pain, indigestion may cause: heartburn, a burning sensation caused by acid passing from the stomach into the oesophagus feeling uncomfortable or heavy belching (burping) regurgitation (food coming back up from the stomach) bloating nausea (feeling sick) vomiting (being sick) Causes of indigestion in pregnancy The symptoms of indigestion (dyspepsia), including heartburn, are caused by stomach acid coming into contact with the sensitive protective lining (mucosa) of your digestive system. The stomach acid breaks down the mucosa, which causes irritation and leads to the symptoms of indigestion. When you're pregnant, you are more likely to have indigestion due to:  hormonal changes that your body is going through your growing womb (uterus) pressing on your stomach the relaxing of the lower oesophageal sphincter (ring of muscle) that acts like a gate between your stomach and your oesophagus, allowing stomach acid to leak back up You may be more likely to get indigestion in pregnancy if: you had indigestion before you were pregnant you have been pregnant before you are in the latter stages of pregnancy Your GP or midwife will usually be able to diagnose indigestion or heartburn from your symptoms and by asking you some questions. For example, they might ask:  how the symptoms are affecting your day-to-day life what your usual eating habits are if you have tried any treatments already if you experienced indigestion or any other stomach conditions before you were pregnant Your GP or midwife may also examine your chest and stomach. They may press gently on different areas of your chest and stomach to see whether this is painful. Treatments for indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy In some cases, changes to your diet and lifestyle may be enough to control indigestion, particularly if the symptoms are mild. If you have severe indigestion, or if changes to your diet and lifestyle don't work, your GP or midwife may suggest using medication to help ease your symptoms. Several indigestion medicines are safe to use during pregnancy. However, check with your GP, midwife or pharmacist before taking anything they have not recommended. The types of medicines that may be prescribed for indigestion and heartburn during pregnancy are: Antacids Antacids are a type of medicine that can provide immediate relief from indigestion. They work by neutralising the acid in your stomach (making it less acidic) so that it no longer irritates the protective lining (mucosa) of your digestive system. Alginates Some antacids are combined with another type of medicine known as an alginate. This helps relieve indigestion caused by acid reflux. Acid reflux occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your oesophagus and irritates its protective lining. Alginates work by forming a foam barrier that floats on the surface of your stomach contents. This keeps stomach acid in your stomach and away from your oesophagus. In most cases, antacids and alginates can effectively control the symptoms of indigestion during pregnancy. Choice and dosage A number of antacids are available over-the-counter from your pharmacist without a prescription. Ask your pharmacist for advice about which ones are suitable for you. You may only need to take antacids and alginates when you start to experience symptoms. In other cases, your GP may recommend that you take these medicines before your symptoms are expected, such as: before a meal before bed It is safe to use antacids and alginates while you are pregnant as long as you do not take more than the recommended dose. Follow the instructions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine to ensure that you take it correctly. Side effects from antacids are rare, but can include: diarrhoea  constipation  Iron supplements If you are prescribed an antacid medicine and you are also taking iron supplements, do not take them at the same time. Antacids can prevent iron from being properly absorbed by your body. Take your antacid at least two hours before or after your iron supplement. Acid-suppressing medicines If antacids and alginates do not improve your symptoms of indigestion, your GP may prescribe a different medicine that suppresses the acid in your stomach. There are two acid-suppressing medicines that are safe to use during pregnancy: ranitidine omeprazole As with antacids and alginates, follow the dosage instructions on the patient information leaflet or packet. Ranitidine Ranitidine is usually prescribed as tablets to be taken twice a day. Follow the dosage instructions, as your medicine may not work if you only take it when you have symptoms. Ranitidine rarely causes any side effects. Omeprazole Omeprazole is usually prescribed as a tablet to take once a day. After five days, your symptoms should have improved. If not, your dose may need to be increased. In some cases, omeprazole may cause side effects such as: headaches diarrhoea nausea vomiting Self-help tips for indigestion in pregnancy You may not need medicine to control your symptoms. Your GP or midwife may suggest some of the following changes to your diet and lifestyle. In many cases, these changes can be enough to ease your symptoms. Stop smoking to banish indigestion Smoking when you're pregnant can cause indigestion and seriously affect your health, as well as the health of your unborn baby. Smoking increases the risk of:  your baby being born prematurely (before week 37 of your pregnancy) your baby being born with a low birth weight cot death, or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) When you smoke, the chemicals you inhale can contribute to your indigestion. These chemicals can cause the ring of muscle at the lower end of your oesophagus to relax. This allows stomach acid to leak back up into your oesophagus more easily (known as acid reflux). If you smoke, quitting is the best thing that you can do for your own and your baby's health. You can speak to your GP or midwife for more information, or you can call the NHS Smokefree Helpline, which offers support and encouragement to help you quit smoking. You can call them on 0300 123 1044 or go to the NHS Smokefree website. Here are 8 steps to take to help you stop smoking right away. Avoid alcohol to ease indigestion Drinking alcohol can contribute to the symptoms of indigestion. During pregnancy, it can also put your unborn baby at risk of developing serious birth defects. Find out more about alcohol and pregnancy. The Department of Health recommends that all pregnant women avoid drinking alcohol completely during pregnancy. It advises that if you do choose to drink while you're pregnant, to minimise risks to your baby you should not drink more than 1-2 units of alcohol once or twice a week, and should not get drunk. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant should avoid drinking alcohol in the first three months of pregnancy because there may be an increased risk of miscarriage. One UK unit is 10ml (or eight grams) of pure alcohol. This is equal to:  half a pint of beer, lager or cider at 3.5% alcohol by volume (ABV: you can find this on the label) a single measure (25ml) of spirit, such as whisky, gin, rum or vodka, at 40% ABV  half a standard (175ml) glass of wine at 11.5% ABV You can find out how many units there are in different types and brands of drinks with the Drinkaware unit calculator. If you have difficulty cutting down what you drink, talk to your midwife, doctor or pharmacist. Confidential help and support is available from local counselling services (look in the telephone directory or contact Drinkline on 0300 123 1110). Eat healthily to avoid indigestion You are more likely to get indigestion if you are very full, so regularly eating large amounts of food may make your symptoms worse. If you are pregnant, it can be tempting to eat more than you would normally, but this may not be good for you or your baby. You don't need to \"eat for two\". During pregnancy you do not need to go on a special diet, but it is important to eat a variety of different foods every day to get the right balance of nutrients that you and your baby need. Find out more about eating a healthy diet in pregnancy and foods to avoid. Change your eating habits In some cases, you may be able to control your indigestion by making changes to the way you eat. For example:  it may help to eat smaller meals more frequently, rather than larger meals three times a day avoid eating within three hours of going to bed at night sit up straight when you eat because this will take the pressure off your stomach Drinking a glass of milk may relieve heartburn (the burning sensation from stomach acid leaking up into your oesophagus). You may want to keep a glass of milk beside your bed in case you wake up with heartburn in the night. Avoid indigestion triggers You may find that your indigestion is made worse by certain triggers, such as:  drinking fruit juice eating chocolate bending over Make a note of any particular food, drink or activity that seems to make your indigestion worse and avoid them if possible. This may mean: eating less rich, spicy and fatty foods cutting down on drinks that contain caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola (find out more about caffeine and pregnancy) Prop your head up When you go to bed, use a couple of pillows to prop your head and shoulders up, or raise the head of your bed by a few inches by putting something underneath the mattress. The slight slope should help prevent stomach acid from moving up into your oesophagus while you sleep.  Prescription medicines Speak to your GP if you are taking medication for another condition, such as antidepressants or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and you think it may be contributing to your indigestion. Your GP may be able to prescribe an alternative medicine. Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are advised to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care.

Allergies are very common. They're thought to affect more than one in four people in the UK at some point in their lives. They are particularly common in children. Some allergies go away as a child gets older, although many are lifelong. Adults can develop allergies to things they weren't previously allergic to. Having an allergy can be a nuisance and affect your everyday activities, but most allergic reactions are mild and can be largely kept under control. Severe reactions can occasionally occur, but these are uncommon. Common allergies Substances that cause allergic reactions are called allergens. The more common allergens include: grass and tree pollen \u2013 an allergy to these is known as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) dust mites animal dander (tiny flakes of skin or hair) food \u2013 particularly nuts, fruit, shellfish, eggs and cow's milk insect bites and stings medication \u2013 including ibuprofen, aspirin, and certain antibiotics latex \u2013 used to make some gloves and condoms mould \u2013 these can release small particles into the air that you can breathe in household chemicals \u2013 including those in detergents and hair dyes Most of these allergens are generally harmless to people who aren't allergic to them. Symptoms of an allergic reaction Allergic reactions usually happen quickly within a few minutes of exposure to an allergen. They can cause: sneezing a runny or blocked nose red, itchy, watery eyes wheezing and coughing a red, itchy rash worsening of asthma or eczema symptoms Most allergic reactions are mild, but occasionally a severe reaction called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock can occur. This is a medical emergency and needs urgent treatment. Read more about the symptoms of allergies. Getting help for allergies See your GP if you think you or your child might have had an allergic reaction to something. The symptoms of an allergic reaction can also be caused by other conditions. Your GP can help determine whether it's likely you have an allergy. If your GP thinks you might have a mild allergy, they can offer advice and treatment to help manage the condition. If your allergy is particularly severe or it's not clear what you're allergic to, your GP may refer you to an allergy specialist for testing and advice about treatment. Read more about allergy testing. How to manage an allergy In many cases, the most effective way of managing an allergy is to avoid the allergen that causes the reaction whenever possible. For example, if you have a food allergy, you should check a food's ingredients list for allergens before eating it. The Food Standards Agency has more information about food allergen labelling. There are also several medications available to help control symptoms of allergic reactions, including: antihistamines \u2013 these can be taken when you notice the symptoms of a reaction, or before being exposed to an allergen to stop a reaction occurring decongestants \u2013 tablets, capsules, nasal sprays or liquids that can be used as a short-term treatment for a blocked nose lotions and creams, such as moisturising creams (emollients) \u2013 these can reduce skin redness and itchiness steroid medication \u2013 sprays, drops, creams, inhalers and tablets that can help reduce redness and swelling caused by an allergic reaction For some people with very severe allergies, a treatment called immunotherapy may be recommended. This involves being exposed to the allergen in a controlled way over a number of years, so your body gets used to it and doesn't react to it so severely. Read more about treating an allergy and avoiding allergic reactions. What causes allergies? Allergies occur when the body's immune system reacts to a particular substance as though it's harmful. It's not clear why this happens, but most people affected have a family history of allergies or have closely related conditions such as asthma or eczema. The number of people with allergies is increasing every year. The reasons for this are not understood, but one of the main theories is it's the result of living in a cleaner, germ-free environment, which reduces the number of germs our immune system has to deal with. It's thought this may cause it to overreact when it comes into contact with harmless substances. Is it an allergy, sensitivity or intolerance? allergy \u2013 a reaction produced by the body's immune system when exposed to a normally harmless substance sensitivity \u2013 the exaggeration of the normal effects of a substance; for example, the caffeine in a cup of coffee may cause extreme symptoms, such as palpitations and trembling intolerance \u2013 where a substance causes unpleasant symptoms, such as diarrhoea, but doesn't involve the immune system; people with an intolerance to certain foods can typically eat a small amount without having any problems Page last reviewed: 12\/02\/2016 Next review due: 12\/02\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It usually affects premature babies.  NRDS is also known as:  hyaline membrane disease infant respiratory distress syndrome newborn respiratory distress syndrome surfactant deficiency lung disease (SDLD) Despite having a similar name, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) isn't related. ARDS is caused by a serious underlying health condition and can affect people of any age. Why it happens NRDS most often occurs when there isn't enough surfactant in the lungs. This substance, made up of proteins and fats, helps keep the lungs inflated and prevents parts of the lung called air sacs collapsing. A baby normally begins producing surfactant sometime between weeks 24 and 28 of pregnancy. Most babies produce enough surfactant to breathe normally by week 34. If your baby is born prematurely, they may not have enough surfactant in their lungs. Occasionally, NRDS occurs in babies that aren't born prematurely. This is usually caused by other risk factors, such as: the mother having diabetes the baby being underweight poor lung development, which can be caused by a variety of illnesses Problems with the genes can play a role in lung development, but this is very rare. It's estimated half of all babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy will develop NRDS. However, this has reduced in recent years, as steroid injections can be given to mothers at risk of NRDS during premature labour. Signs and symptoms The signs of NRDS are often noticeable immediately after birth and get worse over the following few days. They can include: blue-coloured lips, fingers and toes rapid, shallow breathing flaring nostrils a grunting sound when breathing As premature babies are usually born in hospital, most babies with NRDS are already in hospital when they develop these problems and receive treatment. If you give birth outside hospital and notice the above symptoms in your child, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Diagnosing NRDS A number of tests can be used to look for the signs of NRDS and rule out other possible causes. These tests may include: a physical examination blood tests \u2013 to measure the amount of oxygen in the blood and check for an infection a pulse oximetry test \u2013 to measure how much oxygen is being absorbed in the blood, using a sensor attached to the fingertip, ear or toe a chest X-ray \u2013 to look for the distinctive cloudy appearance of NRDS Treating NRDS Most babies with NRDS need breathing help with extra oxygen and possibly some form of ventilator support. Babies needing ventilation can often be treated with a medication directly into the lungs called artificial surfactant, which helps restore normal lung function. Some cases can be prevented or at least made less severe by treating the mother with a medication called betamethasone before birth. Read more about treating NRDS. Complications In the majority of cases NRDS can be treated successfully, and deaths directly linked to NRDS are rare in the UK. However, in more severe cases there's a risk of further problems. These can include scarring to the lungs, leading to longer-term breathing problems. There's also a risk of brain damage, which may result in problems such as learning difficulties.

It is also known as infectious or bacterial arthritis. The condition is most commonly caused by staphylococcal or streptococcal bacteria. These bacteria may have entered a wound and travelled through your bloodstream to the affected joint, or may have infected your joint directly following an injury or during surgery. Any joint can be affected by septic arthritis \u2013 and more than one joint can be affected at a time \u2013 but the condition is most common in the knees and hips. You should see your GP or visit your local accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible if you think you or your child may have septic arthritis. The sooner the infection is picked up and treated, the better the outlook. If the condition is left untreated, it can become life-threatening and can lead to permanent joint damage. Signs and symptoms Septic arthritis typically causes severe pain, swelling, redness and heat in affected joints. These symptoms tend to develop quickly over a few hours or days. You may also have difficulty moving the affected joint and some people have a high temperature (fever). Young children with septic arthritis will generally be irritable and may cry whenever the infected joint is moved (for example, during nappy changing). They may also try to avoid using or putting any weight on affected joints. Who's at risk? Septic arthritis can be seen at any age, including in babies and infants, although it is less common in older children, teenagers and young adults. The following factors can increase your risk of septic arthritis: having an artificial joint implant, such as a knee replacement or hip replacement having a bacterial infection somewhere else in your body having a long-term condition such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis using injected drugs taking medication that suppresses your immune system recently injuring a joint recently having joint surgery or injections into your joints Diagnosis septic arthritis If your symptoms suggest septic arthritis, your GP will refer you to your nearest A&E department immediately for an assessment. You may have a blood test and a sample of fluid removed from your affected joint with a needle to look for signs of inflammation and infection, and to identify any bacteria. If you have septic arthritis, there may be high numbers of white blood cells (a sign of infection) in your blood and joint fluid. However, in many cases these tests come back normal, so they cannot be relied upon to rule out the infection. Treating septic arthritis Septic arthritis is treated with antibiotics. You will normally need to stay in hospital for at least two weeks to have antibiotics given to you intravenously (directly into a vein). You may need to rest in bed for a few days to take pressure off the affected joint and you will be given medication to relieve the pain. You might also have the fluid drained from your infected joint using a needle and syringe, or during a procedure called an arthroscopy (where a fine, metal tube is inserted through a small incision near the affected joint). This will normally be done by the orthopaedic surgeon. After you finish the course of intravenous antibiotics, you'll probably need to take antibiotic tablets at home for at least another four weeks. You should completely recover after antibiotic treatment, although some people still experience persistent limited movement in the affected joint.

It is also known as infectious mononucleosis, or \"mono\". Common symptoms include: a high temperature (fever) a severely sore throat swollen glands in the neck fatigue (extreme tiredness) While the symptoms of glandular fever can be very unpleasant, most of them should pass within two to three weeks. Fatigue, however, can occasionally last several months. Read more about the symptoms of glandular fever. When to seek medical advice You should contact your GP if you suspect that you or your child has glandular fever. While there is little your GP can do in terms of treatment, they can provide advice and support to help you control your symptoms and reduce the risk of passing the infection on to others. You should go to your local accident and emergency (A&E) department or dial 999 for an ambulance if you have glandular fever and you: develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties find swallowing fluids difficult develop intense abdominal pain These symptoms can be a sign of a complication of glandular fever that may need to be treated in hospital. What causes glandular fever? Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is found in the saliva of infected people and can be spread through: kissing \u2013 glandular fever is often referred to as the \"kissing disease\" exposure to coughs and sneezes sharing eating and drinking utensils, such as cups, glasses and unwashed cutlery EBV may be found in the saliva of someone who has had glandular fever for several months after their symptoms pass, and some people may continue to have the virus in their saliva on and off for years. If you have EBV, it's a good idea to take steps to avoid infecting others while you are ill, such as not kissing other people, but there's no need no need to avoid all contact with others as the chances of passing on the infection are generally low. Read more about the causes of glandular fever. Who is affected? Glandular fever can affect people of all ages, but most cases affect teenagers and young adults. Most EBV infections are thought to occur during childhood and cause only mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all. However, if a person develops an EBV infection during early adulthood, they can develop glandular fever. Once you have had glandular fever, it is unlikely you will develop it again. This is because people develop lifelong immunity after the initial infection. How glandular fever is diagnosed To diagnose glandular fever, your GP will first ask about your symptoms before carrying out a physical examination. They will look for characteristic signs of glandular fever, such as swollen glands, tonsils, liver and spleen. Your GP may also recommend a blood test to help confirm the diagnosis and rule out infections that can cause similar symptoms, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella, mumps and toxoplasmosis. How glandular fever is treated There is no cure for glandular fever, but there are a number of simple treatments and measures that can help reduce the symptoms while you wait for your body to control the infection. These include: drinking plenty of fluids taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen getting plenty of rest and gradually increasing your activity as your energy levels improve Occasionally, antibiotics or corticosteroids may be used if you develop complications of glandular fever. Some people with particularly severe symptoms may need to be looked after in hospital for a few days. Read more about treating glandular fever. Possible complications Complications associated with glandular fever are uncommon, but when they do occur they can be serious. They can include: further infections of other areas of the body, including the brain, liver and lungs severe anaemia (a lack of oxygen-carrying red blood cells) breathing difficulties as a result of the tonsils becoming significantly swollen a ruptured (burst) spleen, which may need to be treated with surgery Read more about the complications of glandular fever.

Around one in seven couples may have difficulty conceiving. This is approximately 3.5 million people in the UK. About 84% of couples will conceive naturally within one year if they have regular unprotected sex. For every 100 couples trying to conceive naturally: 84 will conceive within one year 92 will conceive within two years  93 will conceive within three years For couples who have been trying to conceive for more than three years without success, the likelihood of pregnancy occurring within the next year is 25% or less. Deciding to seek help Some women get pregnant quickly, but for others it can take longer. It is a good idea for a couple to visit their GP if they have not conceived after one year of trying. Women aged 36 and over, and anyone who is already aware they may have fertility problems, should see their GP sooner. The GP can check for common causes of fertility problems, and suggest treatments that could help. A couple will only be diagnosed as being infertile if they have not managed to have a baby after one year of trying. There are two types of infertility: primary infertility \u2013 where someone who has never conceived a child in the past has difficulty conceiving secondary infertility \u2013 where a person has had one or more pregnancies in the past, but is having difficulty conceiving again Read more information about how infertility is diagnosed. What causes infertility? There are many potential causes of infertility, and fertility problems can affect either the man or the woman. However, it is not always possible to identify the cause. Common causes of infertility in women include lack of regular ovulation (the monthly release of an egg), blockage of the fallopian tubes and endometriosis. However, for 25% of couples, the cause is unexplained. In men, the most common cause is poor quality of semen (the fluid containing sperm that is ejaculated during sex). For some people, leading a healthy lifestyle and staying up to date with regular health checks and tests may help to prevent infertility. What treatment is available? Types of fertility treatment available include: medical treatment for lack of regular ovulation surgical procedures \u2013 such as treatment for endometriosis assisted conception \u2013 which may be intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) The treatment offered will depend on what is causing your fertility problems and what is available from your local CCG. You may wish to consider private treatment. This can be expensive, and there is no guarantee it will be successful. It is important to choose a private clinic carefully. You can ask your GP for advice, and you should make sure you choose a clinic that is licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Read more about how infertility is treated. Some types of infertility treatment can cause complications, including: side effects of medication increased risk of ectopic pregnancy multiple pregnancy stress Read more about complications associated with infertility treatments.

During IVF, an egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilised egg, called an embryo, is then returned to the woman's womb to grow and develop. It can be carried out using your eggs and your partner's sperm, or eggs and\/or sperm from donors. Who can have IVF? The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published fertility guidelines that make recommendations about who should have access to IVF treatment on the NHS in England and Wales. These guidelines recommended that IVF should be offered to women under 43 years of age who have been trying to get pregnant through regular unprotected sex for two years, or who have had 12 cycles of artificial insemination. However, the final decision about who can have NHS-funded IVF in England is made by local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), and their criteria may be stricter than those recommended by NICE. If you're not eligible for NHS treatment, or you decide to pay for IVF, you can have treatment at a private clinic. Costs vary, but one cycle of treatment may cost up to £5,000 or more. Read more about the availability of IVF. Speaking to your GP about IVF If you're having trouble getting pregnant, you should start by speaking to your GP. They can advise on how to improve your chances of having a baby.  If these measures don't work, your GP can refer you to a fertility specialist for a treatment such as IVF.

What happens during IVF IVF involves six main stages: Suppressing your natural cycle \u2013 the menstrual cycle is suppressed with medication Boosting your egg supply \u2013 medication is used to encourage the ovaries to produce more eggs than usual Monitoring your progress and maturing your eggs \u2013 an ultrasound scan is carried out to check the development of the eggs, and medication is used to help them mature Collecting the eggs \u2013 a needle is inserted into the ovaries, via the vagina, to remove the eggs Fertilising the eggs \u2013 the eggs are mixed with the sperm for a few days to allow them to be fertilised Transferring the embryo(s) \u2013 one or two fertilised eggs (embryos) are placed into the womb Once the embryo(s) has been transferred into your womb, you'll need to wait two weeks before having a pregnancy test, to see if the treatment has worked. Read more about what happens during IVF. Chances of success The success rate of IVF depends on the age of the woman undergoing treatment, as well as the cause of the infertility (if it's known). Younger women are more likely to have a successful pregnancy. IVF isn't usually recommended for women above the age of 42, because the chances of a successful pregnancy are thought to be too low. In 2010, the percentage of IVF treatments that resulted in a live birth was: 32.2% for women under 35   27.7% for women aged 35-37   20.8% for women aged 38-39    13.6% for women aged 40-42    5% for women aged 43-44  1.9% for women aged over 44 Maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding alcohol, smoking and caffeine during treatment may improve your chances of having a baby with IVF. What are the risks? IVF doesn't always result in pregnancy, and it can be both physically and emotionally demanding. You should be offered counselling to help you through the process. There are also a number of health risks involved, including: side effects from the medications used during treatment, such as hot flushes and headaches multiple births (such as twins or triplets) \u2013 this can be dangerous for both the mother and the children an ectopic pregnancy \u2013 where the embryo implants in the fallopian tubes, rather than in the womb ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) \u2013 where too many eggs develop in the ovaries Read more about support available during and after IVF and the risks of IVF.

Having a low sperm count can make it more difficult to conceive naturally, although successful pregnancies can still occur. Problems with sperm, including a low sperm count and problems with sperm quality, are quite common. They're a factor in around one in three couples who are struggling to get pregnant. There are treatments available on the NHS or privately that can help you become a dad if you have a low sperm count. This page covers: Getting tested Home-testing kits Causes Treatments Getting your sperm count checked See your GP if you have not managed to conceive after one year of trying for a baby. It's a good idea for both you and your partner to get advice, as fertility problems can affect men and women and often it's a combination of both. It's important to understand what the exact issue is before you decide on your next steps. One of the tests your GP can arrange is a semen analysis. This is where a sample of your semen is analysed in a laboratory to check the quality and quantity of the sperm. The results are usually available within a week. If the results are abnormal, the test should be repeated to ensure it was accurate. This will normally be performed after three months. Your GP can refer you to a specialist in male infertility at your local hospital or fertility clinic if any problems are found. Home sperm count testing kits There are several male fertility home-testing kits available to buy from pharmacies. These tests claim to indicate whether your sperm count is low. It may be tempting to try one of the tests if you would rather not see your GP, but you should be aware that: although research by the manufacturers suggests these tests can give an accurate indication of sperm count, they haven't been extensively studied some home-testing kits classify a low sperm count as under 20 million sperm per millilitre of semen, but more recent international guidelines state that anything above 15 million sperm per millilitre of semen is normal home-testing kits only check the number of sperm, not other things that can affect fertility, such as how well the sperm are able to move (motility) While these tests might sometimes give a useful indication of your sperm count, they may also give you false reassurance or may suggest your sperm count is low when it's actually perfectly normal. It's better to see your GP for a proper semen analysis at an accredited laboratory if you're concerned about your fertility. See how to use self-test kits safely for more about the issues of home-testing. Causes of a low sperm count In many cases, it's not obvious what causes a low sperm count. Sometimes problems with sperm count and quality are associated with: a hormone imbalance, such as hypogonadism (reduced hormone production) a genetic problem such as Klinefelter syndrome having had undescended testicles as a baby a structural problem \u2013 for example, the tubes that carry sperm being damaged and blocked by illness or injury, or being absent from birth a genital infection such as chlamydia, gonorrhoea or prostatitis (infection of the prostate gland) varicoceles (enlarged veins in the testicles) previous surgery to the testicles or hernia repairs  the testicles becoming overheated excessive alcohol consumption, smoking and using drugs such as marijuana or cocaine certain medications, including testosterone replacement therapy, long-term anabolic steroid use, cancer medications (chemotherapy), some antibiotics and some antidepressants Treatments for low sperm count If you or your partner has been diagnosed with a low sperm count, there are several options available. Keep trying Your doctor may initially suggest trying to conceive naturally for a little longer. Many couples conceive within the second year of trying. You can help maximise your chances of conceiving by: having sex every two or three days moderating your alcohol consumption and stopping smoking staying in good shape, exercising regularly and having a healthy, balanced diet Read more about how to improve your chances of becoming a dad. IVF In vitro fertilisation (IVF) may be an option if you have a slightly low sperm count and you've been trying to conceive naturally with your partner for at least two years. During IVF, an egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to grow and develop. Read more about IVF. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a type of IVF technique, in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg to fertilise it. The fertilised egg is then transferred to the woman's womb. ICSI may be offered if you've been trying to conceive naturally with your partner for at least two years and you have either: few or no sperm in your semen poor quality sperm Before having ICSI, you and your partner will need to have an assessment to ensure the treatment is appropriate. This will involve questions about your medical and sexual history, and screening tests to check for infections or genetic problems that could affect your baby and the chances of ICSI working. The Human Fertilisation & Embryo Authority (HFEA) has more information about ICSI. Donor insemination Donor insemination means using sperm donated by another man. You may wish to consider using donor insemination as an alternative to ICSI, particularly if the man has a genetic disorder that could be passed on to any children. It can be used as part of IVF if necessary. If you're considering donor insemination, you should be offered counselling as a couple about the implications for you and your children. Read more about what you need to know about using a sperm donor. Gonadotrophin medication If you have very low levels of gonadotrophin hormones (which stimulate the production of sperm), you should be offered treatment with gonadotrophin medication to improve your fertility. But if no cause has been found for your abnormal sperm count, you will not be offered hormone-based medicines as they are not known to improve fertility in these cases.

Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease are long-term (chronic) conditions that involve inflammation of the gut (gastrointestinal tract). Ulcerative colitis only affects the colon (large intestine), while Crohn\u2019s disease can affect all of the digestive system, from the mouth to the anus. It\u2019s sometimes difficult to tell the difference between the two main types of IBD. If this is the case, it\u2019s known as indeterminate colitis. There are other, less common types of IBD called collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis. The inflammation can only be seen using a microscope, and so they\u2019re known as microscopic colitis. What are the symptoms? The main symptoms of ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease are similar. They include: pain, swelling or cramping in the tummy recurring or bloody diarrhoea weight loss extreme tiredness Not everyone has all of these symptoms, and some people may experience additional symptoms, including vomiting, anaemia and high temperature (fever). The symptoms of IBD can come and go. People may experience periods of severe symptoms (flare-ups), and go through long periods when they have few or no symptoms at all (remission). Read more about ulcerative colitis and the symptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease. Causes of inflammatory bowel disease The exact causes of ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease are unclear. It\u2019s thought that several factors may play a part, such as: genetics \u2013 there is evidence that you are more likely to develop IBD if you have a close relative with the condition disruption to the immune system (the body\u2019s defence against infection) \u2013 inflammation may be caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissue inside the digestive system while fighting off a virus or bacteria Read more about the causes of ulcerative colitis and causes of Crohn\u2019s disease. Treatment of IBD There is currently no cure for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and prevent them from returning. Mild ulcerative colitis may not need treatment as symptoms can clear up after a few days. Medicines used to treat ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease include: aminosalicylates, or in more severe cases, corticosteroids \u2013 to reduce inflammation immunosuppressants \u2013 to reduce the activity of the immune system An estimated 20% of people with ulcerative colitis have severe symptoms that often don't respond to medication. In these cases, it may be necessary to surgically remove an inflamed section of the digestive system. Around 60-75% of people with Crohn\u2019s disease will require surgery to repair damage to their digestive system and treat complications of the condition. Read more about treating ulcerative colitis and treating Crohn\u2019s disease. Who is affected? It is estimated that IBD affects about one person in every 250 in the UK. There are around 146,000 people with ulcerative colitis and 115,000 with Crohn's disease in the UK. IBD is usually diagnosed in people in their late teens or early 20s, but can affect people of any age. IBD is more common in white people than in black people or those of Asian origin. People from an Eastern European Jewish background are most likely to be affected by IBD. Woman and men are equally affected. Want to know more?

Inflammation can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the back passage, but most commonly occurs in the last section of the small intestine (ileum) or the large intestine (colon). Common symptoms can include: diarrhoea abdominal pain fatigue (extreme tiredness) unintended weight loss blood and mucus in your faeces (stools) People with Crohn's disease sometimes go for long periods without symptoms or with very mild symptoms. This is known as remission. Remission can be followed by periods where symptoms flare up and become particularly troublesome. Read more about the symptoms of Crohn's disease and diagnosing Crohn's disease. Why it happens The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. However, research suggests a combination of factors may be responsible. These include: genetics \u2013 genes you inherit from your parents may increase your risk of developing Crohn's disease the immune system \u2013 the inflammation may be caused by a problem with the immune system (the body's defence against infection and illness) that causes it to attack healthy bacteria in the gut previous infection \u2013 a previous infection may trigger an abnormal response from the immune system smoking \u2013 smokers with Crohn's disease usually have more severe symptoms than non-smokers environmental factors \u2013 Crohn's disease is most common in westernised countries such as the UK, and least common in poorer parts of the world such as Africa, which suggests the environment has a part to play; this is known as the hygiene hypothesis  Read more about the possible causes of Crohn's disease. Treating Crohn's disease There's currently no cure for Crohn's disease, so the aim of treatment is to stop the inflammatory process, relieve symptoms (induce and maintain remission) and avoid surgery wherever possible. The first treatment offered to reduce symptoms is usually steroid medication (corticosteroids). If this doesn't help, medication to suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants) and medication to reduce inflammation may be used. In some cases, surgery may be needed to remove the inflamed section of intestine. Once your symptoms are under control (in remission), further medication may be needed to help maintain this. Who is affected? Crohn's disease is a relatively uncommon condition. There are currently at least 115,000 people living with the condition in the UK. Crohn's disease can affect people of all ages, including children. However, most cases first develop between the ages of 16 and 30.  A large number of cases also develop between the ages of 60 and 80. It affects slightly more women than men, but in children more boys are affected than girls. The condition is more common in white people than in black or Asian people. It's most prevalent among Jewish people of European descent. Read more about treating Crohn's disease. Complications Over time, inflammation can damage sections of the digestive system, resulting in complications such as narrowing of the intestine (stricture), or a channel developing between the end of the bowel and the skin near the anus or vagina (fistula). These problems usually require surgical treatment. Read more about the possible complications of Crohn's disease. Information about you If you have Crohn's disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. IBD or IBS? Conditions that cause inflammation of the intestines, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, are known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This shouldn't be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is a different condition and requires different treatment. However, some people with IBD can also have IBS.

The opening is known as a stoma. A special bag is placed over the stoma to collect waste products that usually pass through the colon (large intestine) and out of the body through the rectum and back passage (anus). Ileostomy procedures are relatively common in the UK. More than 9,000 are carried out each year in England. When is an ileostomy needed? Ileostomies are formed to either temporarily or permanently stop digestive waste passing through the full length of the small intestine or colon. There are a number of reasons why this may be necessary, including: to allow the small intestine or colon to heal after it's been operated on \u2013 for example, if a section of bowel has been removed to treat bowel cancer to relieve inflammation of the colon in people with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis to allow for complex surgery to be carried out on the anus or rectum Read more about why ileostomy procedures are carried out. The ileostomy procedure Before an ileostomy is formed, you'll normally see a specialist stoma nurse to discuss exactly where you'd like your stoma to be (usually somewhere on the right-hand side of the abdomen) and to talk about living with a stoma. There are two main types of ileostomy: loop ileostomy \u2013 where a loop of small intestine is pulled out through a cut (incision) in your abdomen, before being opened up and stitched to the skin to form a stoma end ileostomy \u2013 where the ileum is separated from the colon and is brought out through the abdomen to form a stoma Alternatively, it's sometimes possible for an internal pouch to be created that's connected to your anus (ileo-anal pouch). This means there's no stoma and stools are passed out of your back passage in a similar way to normal. End ileostomies and ileo-anal pouches are usually permanent. Loop ileostomies are usually intended to be temporary and can be reversed during an operation at a later date. Read more about: How an ileostomy is formed  Reversing an ileostomy After surgery You may need to stay in hospital for up to two weeks after an ileostomy operation. During this time you'll be taught how to look after your stoma by a specialist stoma nurse. Recovering from the procedure can be challenging. Many people experience short-term physical and psychological problems, ranging from skin irritation around the stoma to feelings of anxiety and self-consciousness. However, with practise and support from a designated stoma nurse, many people adjust and often find their quality of life improves after surgery. This is especially true if they've been living for years with a condition such as Crohn's disease. Read more about: Recovering from an ileostomy procedure Living with an ileostomy Complications As with any surgical procedure, having an ileostomy carries a risk of complications. Some of the problems people with an ileostomy experience include: a bowel obstruction \u2013 where the output of digestive waste is blocked vitamin B12 deficiency \u2013 caused by the removal of part of the intestine that absorbs vitamin B12 stoma problems \u2013 such as widening or narrowing of the stoma, making it difficult to attach the external bag Read more about the risks of having an ileostomy.

The colon is the large intestine (bowel), and the rectum is the end of the bowel where stools are stored. Small ulcers can develop on the colon's lining, and can bleed and produce pus. Symptoms of ulcerative colitis The main symptoms of ulcerative colitis are: recurring diarrhoea, which may contain blood, mucus or pus abdominal (tummy) pain needing to empty your bowels frequently You may also experience fatigue (extreme tiredness), loss of appetite and weight loss. The severity of the symptoms varies, depending on how much of the rectum and colon is inflamed and how severe the inflammation is. For some people, the condition has a significant impact on their everyday lives. Symptoms of a flare-up Some people may go for weeks or months with very mild symptoms, or none at all (known as remission), followed by periods where the symptoms are particularly troublesome (known as flare-ups or relapses). During a flare-up, some people with ulcerative colitis also experience symptoms elsewhere in their body. For example, some people develop: painful and swollen joints (arthritis) mouth ulcers areas of painful, red and swollen skin irritated and red eyes In severe cases, defined as having to empty your bowels six or more times a day, additional symptoms may include: shortness of breath a fast or irregular heartbeat a high temperature (fever) blood in your stools becoming more obvious In most people, no specific trigger for flare-ups is identified, although a gut infection can occasionally be the cause. Stress is also thought to be a potential factor. Read more about living with ulcerative colitis. When to seek medical advice You should see your GP as soon as possible if you have symptoms of ulcerative colitis and you haven't been diagnosed with the condition. They can arrange blood or stool sample tests to help determine what may be causing your symptoms. If necessary, they can refer you to hospital for further tests. Read more about diagnosing ulcerative colitis. If you've been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and think you may be having a severe flare-up, contact your GP or care team for advice. You may need to be admitted to hospital. If you can't contact your GP or care team, call NHS 111 or contact your local out-of-hours service. What causes ulcerative colitis? Ulcerative colitis is thought to be an autoimmune condition. This means the immune system \u2013 the body's defence against infection \u2013 goes wrong and attacks healthy tissue. The most popular theory is that the immune system mistakes harmless bacteria inside the colon for a threat and attacks the tissues of the colon, causing it to become inflamed. Exactly what causes the immune system to behave in this way is unclear. Most experts think it's a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Read more about the causes of ulcerative colitis. Who's affected? It's estimated that around 1 in every 420 people living in the UK has ulcerative colitis; this amounts to around 146,000 people. The condition can develop at any age, but is most often diagnosed in people from 15 to 25 years old. It's more common in white people of European descent (especially those descended from Ashkenazi Jewish communities) and black people. The condition is rarer in people from Asian backgrounds (although the reasons for this are unclear). Both men and women seem to be equally affected by ulcerative colitis. How ulcerative colitis is treated Treatment for ulcerative colitis aims to relieve symptoms during a flare-up and prevent symptoms from returning (known as maintaining remission). In most people, this is achieved by taking medication such as: aminosalicylates (ASAs) corticosteroids immunosuppressants Mild to moderate flare-ups can usually be treated at home. However, more severe flare-ups need to be treated in hospital to reduce the risk of serious complications, such as the colon becoming stretched and enlarged or developing large ulcers. Both of these can increase the risk of developing a hole in the bowel. If medications aren't effective at controlling your symptoms, or your quality of life is significantly affected by your condition, surgery to remove your colon may be an option. During surgery, your small intestine will either be diverted out of an opening in your abdomen (known as an ileostomy), or used to create an internal pouch that's connected to your anus (known as an ileo-anal pouch). Read more about: treating ulcerative colitis complications of ulcerative colitis IBD or IBS? Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a term mainly used to describe two conditions that cause inflammation of the gut (gastrointestinal tract). They are: ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease IBD shouldn't be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is a different condition and requires different treatment.

It can be very unpleasant, but you'll usually begin to feel better within about a week. You can catch flu \u2013 short for influenza \u2013 all year round, but it's especially common in winter, which is why it's also known as \"seasonal flu\". It's not the same as the common cold. Flu is caused by a different group of viruses and the symptoms tend to start more suddenly, be more severe and last longer. Some of the main symptoms of flu include: a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above tiredness and weakness a headache general aches and pains a dry, chesty cough Cold-like symptoms \u2013 such as a blocked or runny nose, sneezing, and a sore throat \u2013 can also be caused by flu, but they tend to be less severe than the other symptoms you have. Flu can make you feel so exhausted and unwell that you have to stay in bed and rest until you feel better. Read more about the symptoms of flu. What to do If you're otherwise fit and healthy, there's usually no need to see a doctor if you have flu-like symptoms. The best remedy is to rest at home, keep warm and drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. You can take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower a high temperature and relieve aches if necessary. Stay off work or school until you're feeling better. For most people, this will take about a week. Read more about treating flu at home. When to see your GP Consider visiting your GP if: you're 65 years of age or over you're pregnant you have a long-term medical condition \u2013 such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease or a neurological disease you have a weakened immune system \u2013 for example, because you're having chemotherapy or have HIV you develop chest pain, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or start coughing up blood your symptoms are getting worse over time or haven't improved after a week In these situations, you may need medication to treat or prevent complications of flu. Your doctor may recommend taking antiviral medicine to reduce your symptoms and help you recover more quickly. Read more about antiviral medication for flu. How long does flu last and is it serious? If you have flu, you generally start to feel ill within a few days of being infected. You should begin to feel much better within a week or so, although you may feel tired for much longer. You will usually be most infectious from the day your symptoms start and for a further three to seven days. Children and people with weaker immune systems may remain infectious for longer. Most people will make a full recovery and won't experience any further problems, but elderly people and people with certain long-term medical conditions are more likely to have a bad case of flu or develop a serious complication, such as a chest infection. Read more about the complications of flu. How you catch flu The flu virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when someone who is infected coughs or sneezes. These droplets typically spread about one metre. They hang suspended in the air for a while before landing on surfaces, where the virus can survive for up to 24 hours. Anyone who breathes in the droplets can catch flu. You can also catch the virus by touching the surfaces that the droplets have landed on if you pick up the virus on your hands and then touch your nose or mouth. Everyday items at home and in public places can easily become contaminated with the flu virus, including food, door handles, remote controls, handrails, telephone handsets and computer keyboards. Therefore, it's important to wash your hands frequently. You can catch flu many times, because flu viruses change regularly and your body won't have natural resistance to the new versions. Preventing the spread of flu You can help stop yourself catching flu or spreading it to others with good hygiene measures. Always wash your hands regularly with soap and warm water, as well as: regularly cleaning surfaces such as your computer keyboard, telephone and door handles to get rid of germs using tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze putting used tissues in a bin as soon as possible You can also help stop the spread of flu by avoiding unnecessary contact with other people while you're infectious. You should stay off work or school until you're feeling better. In some people at risk of more serious flu, an annual flu vaccine (see below) or antiviral medication may be recommended to help reduce the risk of becoming infected. Read more about how to stop the spread of flu. The flu vaccine A flu vaccine is available for free on the NHS for: anyone over the age of 65  pregnant women anyone who is very overweight (with a body mass index over 40) children and adults with an underlying health condition (particularly long-term heart or lung disease) children and adults with weakened immune systems An annual flu vaccine nasal spray is also now offered to healthy children aged two, three and four years old, and to children in school years one and two.  The best time to have the vaccine is in the autumn, between September and early November. If you think you might need it, contact your local GP surgery. You should have the flu vaccination every year so you stay protected, as the viruses that cause flu change every year. For more information on who should have the flu vaccine and how to get it, read the sections on the flu jab for adults, the flu jab for pregnant women and the children's flu vaccine. Other types of flu As well as seasonal flu, there are several other types of flu. These include: bird (avian) flu \u2013 a type of flu spread among birds that affects humans in rare cases swine flu \u2013 the type of flu that was responsible for the flu pandemic in 2009-10 \"gastric flu\" (gastroenteritis) \u2013 an infection of the digestive system, which can be caused by bacteria or viruses such as the norovirus Click on the links above for more information about these types of flu.

Flu can be unpleasant, but if you are otherwise healthy it will usually clear up on its own within a week. However, flu can be more severe in certain people, such as: anyone aged 65 and over pregnant women children and adults with an underlying health condition (particularly long-term heart or respiratory disease) children and adults with weakened immune systems Anyone in these risk groups is more likely to develop potentially serious complications of flu, such as pneumonia (a lung infection), so it's recommended that they have a flu vaccine every year to protect them.  The injected flu vaccine is offered free on the NHS annually to: adults over the age of 18 at risk of flu (including everyone aged 65 and over) pregnant women  children aged six months to two years at risk of flu Find out more about who should have the flu jab. Flu nasal spray vaccination The flu vaccine is routinely given on the NHS as an annual nasal spray to: children aged two, three and four years old plus children in school years one, two and three.  children aged two to 17 years at a particular risk of flu Read more about the flu nasal spray for children. 65 and overs and the flu jab You are eligible for the flu vaccine this year (2016-17) if you will be aged 65 and over on March 31 2017 \u2013 that is, you were born on or before March 31 1952. So, if you are currently 64 but will be 65 on March 31 2017, you do qualify. Where to get the flu jab You can have your NHS flu jab at: your GP surgery a local pharmacy offering the service your midwifery service if they offer it for pregnant women Some community pharmacies now offer flu vaccination to adults (but not children) at risk of flu including pregnant women, people aged 65 and over, people with long-term health conditions and carers. If you have your flu jab at a pharmacy, you don't have to inform your GP \u2013 it is up to the pharmacist to do that. How effective is the flu jab? Flu vaccine is the best protection we have against an unpredictable virus that can cause unpleasant illness in children and severe illness and death among at-risk groups, including older people, pregnant women and those with an underlying medical health condition. Studies have shown that the flu jab does work and will help prevent you getting the flu. It won't stop all flu viruses and the level of protection may vary between people, so it's not a 100% guarantee that you'll be flu-free, but if you do get flu after vaccination it's likely to be milder and shorter-lived than it would otherwise have been. There is also evidence to suggest that the flu jab can reduce your risk of having a stroke. Over time, protection from the injected flu vaccine gradually decreases and flu strains often change. So new flu vaccines are produced each year which is why people advised to have the flu jab need it every year too. Read more about how the flu jab works. Flu jab side effects Serious side effects of the injected flu vaccine are very rare. You may have a slight temperature and aching muscles for a couple of days after having the jab, and your arm may be a bit sore where you were injected. Read more about the side effects of the flu jab. When to have a flu jab The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn, from the beginning of October to early November, but don't worry if you've missed it, you can have the vaccine later in winter. Ask your GP or pharmacist. The flu jab for 2016\/17 Each year, the viruses that are most likely to cause flu are identified in advance and vaccines are made to match them as closely as possible. The vaccines are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Most injected flu vaccines protect against three types of flu virus: A\/H1N1 \u2013 the strain of flu that caused the swine flu pandemic in 2009 A\/H3N2 \u2013 a strain of flu that mainly affects the elderly and people with risk factors like a long term health condition. In 2016\/17 the vaccine will contain an A\/Hong Kong\/4801\/2014 H3N2-like virus Influenza B - a strain of flu that particularly affects children. In 2016\/17 the vaccine will contain B\/Brisbane\/60\/2008-like virus The nasal spray flu vaccine and some injected vaccines also offer protection against a fourth B strain of virus, which in 2016\/17 is the B\/Phuket\/3073\/2013-like virus. Is there anyone who shouldn't have the flu jab? Most adults can have the injected flu vaccine, but you should avoid it if you have had a serious allergic reaction to a flu jab in the past. Read more about who shouldn't have the flu vaccine. You can find out more by reading the answers to the most common questions that people have about the flu vaccine.

They produce raised red spots, which can sometimes become infected and turn into painful, pus-filled sores. Ingrown hairs can be itchy and embarrassing, but they often go away on their own without doing anything. Anyone can get ingrown hairs, but they tend to be more of a problem in people with coarse or curly hair. This topic covers: What causes ingrown hairs? What to do If there are lots of pus-filled spots Preventing ingrown hairs Other possible skin conditions  What causes ingrown hairs? Ingrown hairs have usually grown out of the skin, curled back round and re-entered the skin. Some curl back into the hair follicle \u2013 small cavities in the skin that hairs grow out of \u2013 without even exiting the skin. An ingrown hair can occur when the hair follicle becomes clogged with dead skin cells. This forces the hair inside it to grow sideways, which is much more likely to happen if the hair is already curly or coarse and it's recently been shaved. Ingrown hairs can be a particular problem in the areas where you shave \u2013 the beard area in men, and the legs, armpits and pubic area in women. In these places, the hair that grows back has a sharper edge and can easily poke back into the skin. Ingrown hairs look like pimples in the skin, and sometimes you can see the hair trapped beneath the skin. The spots can be filled with pus. What to do If possible, you should leave ingrown hairs for a while as they may disappear without you having to do anything.  Don't pick or scratch an ingrown hair as bacteria can enter the small wound created, increasing your risk of infection. It can also cause scarring. You should also avoid squeezing the spots because it can damage the skin and lead to infection. If an ingrown hair is near the surface of your skin, you could use a sterile needle or tweezers to gently tease it out. However, don't dig for the hair if it lies deep below the skin's surface. Men who are prone to getting ingrown hairs around their face may find it best to grow out their beard. Longer hairs aren't as sharp at the ends, so are less likely to become ingrown. If there are lots of pus-filled spots The hair follicles of ingrown hairs can sometimes become infected and inflamed. This is known as folliculitis. The hair follicles will swell into pus-filled spots, although pus doesn't always mean there's an infection. Again, mild cases of folliculitis often clear up without treatment, so try not shaving for a few days and see if it gets better. You could also try dabbing a mild antiseptic, such as tea tree oil, on to the affected area. See your GP if the spots don't improve and are bothering you. If one particular spot is a problem, your GP may be able to release the ingrown hair using a sterile needle. Antibiotics are usually only needed if the skin is severely infected with pustules and abscesses. Preventing ingrown hairs The simplest way to prevent ingrowing hairs is to let your hair grow freely without shaving it. You may want to try this for a brief period if you need relief from particularly bad spots.  If you don't want to stop shaving, the following shaving tips may help: use a sharp, single-bladed razor wet your skin with warm water and use a gel shave in the direction the hairs are growing use as few strokes of the razor as possible rinse the razor after every stroke try not to shave too closely \u2013 leave a bit of stubble if you can, as bacteria can enter the tiny openings of freshly shaved skin Other hair removal methods may be less likely to result in ingrowing hairs. For example, instead of shaving your legs, you may want to try depilatory creams, electrolysis or laser removal. Other possible skin conditions There are many skin conditions that can easily be mistaken for ingrown hairs, including: keratosis pilaris (\"chicken skin\") \u2013 a common, harmless condition where the skin becomes rough and bumpy, as if covered in permanent goose pimples acne  a cyst or abscess eczema  impetigo \u2013 a highly contagious skin infection that mainly affects children  heat rash (prickly heat) pustular psoriasis molluscum contagiosum \u2013 a highly contagious viral infection that affects the skin  See your GP if you're unsure. The above links will take you to more information about these similar-looking skin conditions.

The big toe is often affected, either on one or both sides. The nail curls and pierces the skin, which becomes red, swollen and tender. Other possible symptoms include: pain if pressure is placed on the toe inflammation of the skin at the end of the toe a build-up of fluid (oedema) in the area surrounding the toe an overgrowth of skin around the affected toe (hypertrophy) bleeding white or yellow pus coming from the affected area When to see your GP See your GP or podiatrist (foot care specialist) if your ingrown toenail is badly inflamed, bleeding or has pus coming from it, because it may be infected. Find a podiatrist in your local area. It's also important to seek medical advice if you have diabetes and an ingrown toenail. Having diabetes could affect how your toenail heals. Read more about foot care and diabetes. What causes ingrown toenails? A number of things can cause an ingrown toenail to develop, including: badly cut toenails \u2013 cutting your toenails too short, or cutting the edges, will encourage the skin to fold over your nail and the nail to grow into the skin wearing tight-fitting shoes, socks or tights \u2013 this places pressure on the skin around your toenail; the skin may be pierced if it's pressed on to your toenail sweaty feet \u2013 if the skin around your toenails is soft, it's easier for your nail to pierce it and embed itself within it injury \u2013 for example, stubbing your toe can sometimes cause an ingrown toenail to develop natural shape of the nail \u2013 the sides of curved or fan-shaped toenails are more likely to press into the skin surrounding the nail A fungal nail infection can cause your toenail to thicken or widen. Treating ingrown toenails Left untreated, an ingrown toenail can become infected, so it\u2019s important that you: keep your feet clean by washing them regularly with soap and water change your socks regularly cut your toenails straight across to stop them digging into the surrounding skin gently push the skin away from the nail using a cotton bud (this may be easier after using a small amount of olive oil to soften the skin) wear comfortable shoes that fit properly Surgery may be recommended if your toenail doesn't improve. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, this may involve removing part or all of your toenail. Partial nail avulsion Partial nail avulsion removes part of your toenail and is the most commonly used operation for treating ingrown toenails. It's about 98% effective. A local anaesthetic is used to numb your toe and the edges of your toenail are cut away. A chemical called phenol is applied to the affected area to prevent the nail growing back and becoming ingrown in the future. A course of antibiotics may be prescribed if your nail is infected, and any pus will be drained away. Total nail avulsion Total nail avulsion completely removes your toenail. This may be necessary if your nail is thick and pressing into the skin surrounding your toe. After you toenail has been removed, you\u2019ll have an indentation where your nail used to be. However, it's perfectly safe for you not to have a toenail. After surgery After toenail surgery, your toe will be wrapped in a sterile bandage. This will help stem any bleeding and prevent infection. Rest your foot and keep it raised for one to two days after the operation. To help reduce the pain, you may need to take a painkiller, such as paracetamol, and wear soft or open-toed shoes for the first few days after surgery. Preventing ingrown toenails Taking care of your feet will help prevent foot problems such as ingrown toenails. It\u2019s important to cut your toenails properly (straight across, not at an angle or down the edges). Wash your feet every day, dry them thoroughly and use foot moisturiser. You can also use a foot file or pumice stone to remove hard or dead skin. Wearing shoes that fit properly will help to ensure your feet remain healthy. You should also change your socks (or tights) every day. Visit your GP or a podiatrist as soon as possible if you develop problems with your feet.

Your muscles are usually strong and tight enough to keep your intestines and organs in place, but a hernia can develop if there are any weak spots. What is an inguinal hernia? An inguinal (pronounced \"ingwinal\") hernia is the most common type of hernia. It can appear as a swelling or lump in your groin, or as an enlarged scrotum (the pouch containing the testicles). The swelling may be painful. The lump often appears when you're lifting something and disappears when you lie down. For information on other types of hernia see: femoral hernia hiatus hernia umbilical hernia What causes an inguinal hernia? An inguinal hernia usually occurs when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel, such as the intestine, pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh. It pushes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle wall (the abdominal wall) into an area called the inguinal canal. Inguinal hernias occur mainly in men. Most are thought to result from ageing, although they can occur at any age. This is because as you get older, the muscles surrounding your abdomen (tummy) can become weaker. Inguinal hernias can sometimes appear suddenly after putting pressure on the abdomen, such as straining on the toilet if you have constipation or carrying and pushing heavy loads. They have also been linked to having a persistent, heavy cough. When is surgery needed? Inguinal hernias can be repaired using surgery to push the bulge back into place and strengthen the weakness in the abdominal wall. The operation is usually recommended if you have a hernia that causes pain, severe or persistent symptoms, or if any serious complications develop. Complications that can develop as a result of an inguinal hernia include: obstruction \u2013 where a section of the bowel becomes stuck in the inguinal canal, causing nausea, vomiting and stomach pain, as well as a painful lump in the groin strangulation \u2013 where a section of bowel becomes trapped and its blood supply is cut off; this requires emergency surgery within hours to release the trapped tissue and restore its blood supply, so it doesn't die Surgery gets rid of the hernia to prevent any serious complications, but there's a chance it could return after the operation. What happens during surgery? There are two ways an inguinal hernia repair can be performed: open surgery \u2013 where one cut is made to allow the surgeon to push the lump back into the abdomen laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery \u2013 a less invasive, but more difficult, technique where several smaller cuts are made, allowing the surgeon to use various special instruments to repair the hernia There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods. The type of surgery you have depends on which method suits you and your surgeon\u2019s experience. You should be able to go home the same day or the day after surgery. It's important to follow the hospital's instructions on how to look after yourself. This includes eating a good diet to avoid constipation, caring for the wound and not straining yourself too soon. Most people make a full recovery from inguinal hernia repair within six weeks, although many people can return to driving, work and light activities within two weeks. Read more about: how an inguinal hernia repair is performed recovering from an inguinal hernia repair  Are there any risks from the operation? An inguinal hernia repair is a routine operation with very few risks. However, up to 10% of hernias come back at some point after surgery. Around 2-4% of hernias return within three years. Other potential complications of inguinal hernia repair include: blood or fluid building up in the space left by the hernia (this  usually gets better without treatment) painful swelling and bruising of the testicles or base of the penis (in men) pain and numbness in the groin area caused by a nerve being damaged or trapped during surgery damage to the blood supply to the testicle damage to the vas deferens \u2013 the tube that carries sperm to the testicles Complications are more likely if you're aged over 50, smoke or have another illness, such as heart disease or breathing problems.

In some cases, an inquest will also try to establish the deceased person's identity. The investigation is held in public at a coroner\u2019s court in cases where: a death was sudden, violent or unnatural a death occurred in prison or police custody the cause of death is still unknown after a post-mortem (where a body is examined after death) A coroner's court is a legal body that helps determine how, when and why a person died. Coroners are independent judicial officers who are usually lawyers or doctors with appropriate training in law. Unlike criminal trials, inquests don't try to establish whether anyone was responsible for a person\u2019s death. Evidence is given by witnesses but there's no prosecution or defence. When an inquest is held, the coroner must inform the deceased person's next of kin or personal representative. What happens during an inquest? An inquest will be opened soon after the death. This allows the death to be recorded, the deceased to be identified and the coroner to give authorisation for a burial or cremation to take place as soon as possible. After the inquest has been opened, it may be adjourned (postponed) until after any other investigations have been completed. The average length of adjournment is 27 weeks, although in some cases it may be longer if the case is particularly complex. In some cases, the coroner may hold one or more additional hearings before an inquest begins, known as pre-inquest hearings or reviews. These allow the extent of the inquest to be considered. During an inquest, witnesses chosen by the coroner will give evidence. The coroner usually asks the witness to summarise events in their own words before asking them questions to clarify any points.  Anyone who has a \"proper interest\" can also question a witness. Someone with a proper interest is: a parent, spouse, child, civil partner and anyone acting for the deceased anyone who gains from a life insurance policy of the deceased any insurer who has issued such a policy anyone whose actions the coroner believes may have contributed to the death accidentally or otherwise the chief officer of police (who can only ask questions through a lawyer) any person appointed by a government department The coroner will decide who is given proper interest status. At the end of the inquest, the coroner or jury (if there is one, see below), will come to a conclusion. This will include a legal statement about who died, as well as where, when and how they died. The coroner will make a statement about the cause of death so it can be formally registered. For example, the death may be described as being: an accident or misadventure alcohol or drug related an industrial disease a lawful killing an unlawful killing due to natural causes open (a death that's suspicious but where it isn't possible to confirm the exact cause) a road traffic collision a stillbirth  a suicide  The coroner or jury may also make a brief \"narrative\" conclusion in which they'll set out the facts surrounding the death in more detail and explain the reasons for their decision. When a jury is needed Most inquests are carried out by the coroner alone. However, in some circumstances, the coroner will call a jury to decide the verdict. For example, a jury will be required if the death occurred in prison or in police custody, or if the death was the result of an accident at work. The coroner can also call a jury at their own discretion. Relatives Relatives of the deceased can attend an inquest and are able to ask the witnesses questions. However, they're only able to ask questions relating to the medical cause and circumstances of the death. It's also possible for a relative of the deceased to be represented by a lawyer. This may be particularly important if the death was the result of a road accident, an accident at work, or in other circumstances where a compensation claim might be made. However, legal aid isn't usually available for legal representation during an inquest.

But occasionally they can become infected, cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or spread serious illnesses such as Lyme disease and malaria. Bugs that bite or sting include wasps, hornets, bees, horseflies, ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, spiders and midges. This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you've been bitten or stung When to get medical advice When to get emergency medical help Prevention Symptoms of insect bites and stings Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Some people have a mild allergic reaction and a larger area of skin around the bite or sting becomes swollen, red and painful. This should pass within a week. Occasionally, a severe allergic reaction can occur, causing symptoms such as breathing difficulties, dizziness and a swollen face or mouth. This requires immediate medical treatment (see below). Read more about the symptoms of common insect bites and stings. What to do if you've been bitten or stung To treat an insect bite or sting: Remove the sting or tick if it's still in the skin (see treating insect bites and stings for advice about how to do this safely). Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they're unlikely to help. The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. Ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments that can help, such as painkillers, creams for itching and antihistamines. Read more about treatments for insect bites and stings. When to get medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if: you're worried about a bite or sting your symptoms don't start to improve within a few days or are getting worse you've been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes a large area (around 10cm or more) around the bite becomes red and swollen you have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness you have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a fever, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms When to get emergency medical help Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe reaction, such as: wheezing or difficulty breathing a swollen face, mouth or throat nausea or vomiting a fast heart rate dizziness or feeling faint difficulty swallowing loss of consciousness Emergency treatment in hospital is needed in these cases. Prevent insect bites and stings There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin \u2013 repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants \u2013 these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. You may need to take extra precautions if you're travelling to part of the world where there's a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about how to prevent insect bites and stings.

It's a common problem thought to regularly affect around one in every three people in the UK, and is particularly common in elderly people. If you have insomnia, you may: find it difficult to fall asleep lie awake for long periods at night wake up several times during the night wake up early in the morning and not be able to get back to sleep not feel refreshed when you get up find it hard to nap during the day, despite feeling tired feel tired and irritable during the day and have difficulty concentrating Occasional episodes of insomnia may come and go without causing any serious problems, but for some people it can last for months or even years at a time. Persistent insomnia can have a significant impact on your quality of life. It can limit what you're able to do during the day, affect your mood, and lead to relationship problems with friends, family and colleagues. How much sleep do I need? There are no official guidelines about how much sleep you should get each night because everyone is different. On average, a \"normal\" amount of sleep for an adult is considered to be around seven to nine hours a night. Children and babies may sleep for much longer than this, whereas older adults may sleep less. What's important is whether you feel you get enough sleep, and whether your sleep is good quality. You're probably not getting enough good-quality sleep if you constantly feel tired throughout the day and it's affecting your everyday life. Try the sleep self-assessment to see if you have trouble sleeping. What causes insomnia? It's not always clear what triggers insomnia, but it's often associated with: stress and anxiety a poor sleeping environment \u2013 such as an uncomfortable bed, or a bedroom that's too light, noisy, hot or cold lifestyle factors \u2013 such as jet lag, shift work, or drinking alcohol or caffeine before going to bed mental health conditions \u2013 such as depression and schizophrenia physical health conditions \u2013 such as heart problems, other sleep disorders and long-term pain certain medicines \u2013 such as some antidepressants, epilepsy medicines and steroid medication Read more about the causes of insomnia. What you can do about it There are a number of things you can try to help yourself get a good night's sleep if you have insomnia. These include: setting regular times for going to bed and waking up relaxing before bed time \u2013 try taking a warm bath or listening to calming music using thick curtains or blinds, an eye mask and earplugs to stop you being woken up by light and noise avoiding caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, heavy meals and exercise for a few hours before going to bed not watching TV or using phones, tablets or computers shortly before going to bed  not napping during the day writing a list of your worries, and any ideas about how to solve them, before going to bed to help you forget about them until the morning Some people find over-the-counter sleeping tablets helpful, but they don't address the underlying problem and can have troublesome side effects. Read more self-help tips for insomnia. When to see your GP Make an appointment to see your GP if you're finding it difficult to get to sleep or stay asleep and it's affecting your daily life \u2013 particularly if it has been a problem for a month or more and the above measures have not helped. Your GP may ask you about your sleeping routines, your daily alcohol and caffeine consumption, and your general lifestyle habits, such as diet and exercise. They will also check your medical history for any illness or medication that may be contributing to your insomnia. Your GP may suggest keeping a sleep diary for a couple of weeks to help them gain a better understanding of your sleep patterns. Each day, make a note of things such as the time you went to bed and woke up, how long it took you to fall asleep, and the number of times you woke up during the night. Treatments for insomnia Your GP will first try to identify and treat any underlying health condition, such as anxiety, that may be causing your sleep problems. They'll probably also discuss things you can do at home that may help to improve your sleep. In some cases, a special type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) designed for people with insomnia (CBT-I) may be recommended. This is a type of talking therapy that aims to help you avoid the thoughts and behaviours affecting your sleep. It's usually the first treatment recommended and can help lead to long-term improvement of your sleep. Prescription sleeping tablets are usually only considered as a last resort and should be used for only a few days or weeks at a time. This is because they don't treat the cause of your insomnia and are associated with a number of side effects. They can also become less effective over time. Read more about treating insomnia.

The hormone insulin \u2013 produced by the pancreas \u2013 is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood. There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 \u2013 where the pancreas doesn't produce any insulin Type 2 \u2013 where the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin or the body\u2019s cells don't react to insulin This topic is about type 1 diabetes. Read more about type 2 diabetes. Another type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear following birth. It's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because it will get progressively worse if left untreated. You should therefore visit your GP if you have symptoms, which include feeling thirsty, passing urine more often than usual and feeling tired all the time (see the list below for more diabetes symptoms).  See your GP if you think you may have diabetes Results for Edit Find your GP's contact details Your location could not be found.

Type 1 and type 2 diabetes Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood. Around 10% of all diabetes is type 1, but it's the most common type of childhood diabetes. This is why it's sometimes called juvenile diabetes or early-onset diabetes.  In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas (a small gland behind the stomach) doesn't produce any insulin \u2013 the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels. This is why it's also sometimes called insulin-dependent diabetes. If the amount of glucose in the blood is too high, it can, over time, seriously damage the body's organs. In type 2 diabetes, the body either doesn't produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body's cells don't react to insulin. Around 90% of adults with diabetes have type 2, and it tends to develop later in life than type 1. Diabetes symptoms The symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means that glucose stays in the blood and isn\u2019t used as fuel for energy. Your body tries to reduce blood glucose levels by getting rid of the excess glucose in your urine. Typical symptoms include: feeling very thirsty passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night feeling very tired weight loss and loss of muscle bulk The symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop very quickly in young people (over a few days or weeks). In adults, the symptoms often take longer to develop (a few months). Read more about the symptoms of type 1 diabetes. Causes of type 1 diabetes  Type 1 diabetes occurs as a result of the body being unable to produce insulin, which moves glucose out of the blood and into your cells to be used for energy. Without insulin, your body will break down its own fat and muscle, resulting in weight loss. This can lead to a serious short-term condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, where the bloodstream becomes acidic and you develop dangerous levels of dehydration. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, where the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them. Read more about the causes of type 1 diabetes. Treating type 1 diabetes It's important that diabetes is diagnosed as early as possible, so that treatment can be started. Diabetes can't be cured, but treatment aims to keep your blood glucose levels as normal as possible and control your symptoms, to prevent health problems developing later in life. If you're diagnosed with diabetes, you'll be referred to a diabetes care team for specialist treatment and monitoring. As your body can't produce insulin, you'll need regular insulin injections to keep your glucose levels normal. You'll be taught how to do this and how to match the insulin you inject to the food you eat, taking into account your blood glucose level and how much exercise you do. Insulin injections come in several different forms, with each working slightly differently. Some last up to a whole day (long-acting), some last up to eight hours (short-acting) and some work quickly but don't last very long (rapid-acting). You'll most likely need a combination of different insulin preparations. There are alternatives to insulin injections, but they're only suitable for a small number of patients. They are: insulin pump therapy \u2013 where a small device constantly pumps insulin (at a rate you control) into your bloodstream through a needle that's inserted under the skin islet cell transplantation \u2013 where healthy insulin-producing cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor are implanted into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes (read about the criteria for having an islet transplant) a complete pancreas transplant Read more about diagnosing diabetes and treating type 1 diabetes. Complications If diabetes is left untreated, it can cause a number of different health problems. Large amounts of glucose can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs. Even a mildly raised glucose level that doesn't cause any symptoms can have damaging effects in the long term. Read more about the complications of type 1 diabetes. Living with diabetes If you have type 1 diabetes, you'll need to look after your health very carefully. Caring for your health will also make treating your diabetes easier and minimise your risk of developing complications. For example, eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly will lower your blood glucose level. Stopping smoking (if you smoke) will also reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it's not treated. Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year. Read more about living with diabetes.

They're staffed with specially-trained healthcare professionals and contain sophisticated monitoring equipment. ICUs are also sometimes called critical care units (CCUs) or intensive therapy units (ITUs). This page covers: When intensive care is needed What it involves Visiting Recovery and discharge Making decisions about care Links to more information When intensive care is needed Intensive care is needed if someone is seriously ill and requires intensive treatment and close monitoring, or if they're having surgery and intensive care can help them recover. Most people on an ICU have problems with one or more organs. For example, they may be unable to breathe on their own. There are many different conditions and situations that can mean someone needs intensive care. Some common reasons include: a serious accident \u2013 such as a road accident, a severe head injury, a serious fall or severe burns a serious short-term condition \u2013 such as a heart attack or a stroke a serious infection \u2013 such as sepsis (blood poisoning) or severe pneumonia major surgery \u2013 this can either be a planned part of your recovery, or an emergency measure if there are complications What intensive care involves Patients on an ICU will be looked after closely by a team of ICU staff and will be connected to equipment by a number of tubes, wires and cables. There will normally be one nurse for every one or two patients. This equipment is used to monitor their health and support their bodily functions until they recover. Equipment that may be used on an ICU includes: a ventilator \u2013 a machine that helps with breathing; a tube is placed in the mouth, nose, or through a small cut in the throat (tracheostomy) monitoring equipment \u2013 used to measure important bodily functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure and the level of oxygen in the blood IV lines and pumps \u2013 tubes inserted into a vein (intravenously) to provide fluids, nutrition and medication feeding tubes \u2013 tubes placed in the nose, through a small cut made in the tummy, or into a vein if a person is unable to eat normally drains and catheters \u2013 drains are tubes used to remove any build-up of blood or fluid from the body; catheters are thin tubes inserted into the bladder to drain urine Someone in an ICU will often be on painkilling medication and medication that makes them drowsy (sedatives). This is because some of the equipment used can be uncomfortable. Visiting an ICU An ICU can often be an overwhelming place, both for the patient and their loved ones. It can therefore help to know a little about what to expect. Visiting hours \u2013 visiting hours are usually very flexible, but there may be times when visiting isn't advised so it's a good idea to check before you arrive. The number of people allowed around the person's bed may be limited. Hygiene rules \u2013 to reduce the risk of spreading infection, you'll be asked to clean your hands when entering and leaving the unit and you may not be able to bring in certain things such as flowers. Avoid visiting if you're ill. How patients may look and behave \u2013 the person you're visiting may be drowsy and seem confused. They may also appear slightly swollen or have injuries such as bruises or wounds. This can be upsetting to see, but staff will ensure they're as comfortable as possible. ICU equipment \u2013 a series of tubes, wires and cables will be attached to the patient, which may look alarming at first. Ask staff to explain what these are if you'd like to know. Unfamiliar sounds \u2013 you may hear alarms and bleeps from the equipment. These help staff to monitor their patients. You'll usually be free to touch, comfort and talk to the person. It may help them to hear and recognise familiar voices, even if they don't appear to respond. You might want to tell them about your day, or read them a book or newspaper. You can bring in things to make them more comfortable, but ask staff beforehand if there's anything you shouldn't bring. The ICU staff will be on hand during your visit to answer any questions you have. Recovering from intensive care Once a person no longer needs intensive care, they can be transferred to a different ward to continue their recovery before eventually going home. Some people may leave the ICU after a few days. Others may need to stay in the ICU for months, or may deteriorate there. Many people who leave an ICU will make a good recovery. But sometimes there can be lingering problems, such as: weakness and stiffness fatigue (extreme tiredness) and a lack of energy loss of appetite and weight loss sleep problems  depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) problems with mental abilities \u2013 for example, not being able to think clearly, and being forgetful These problems can last several months. Get medical advice if they are a persistent issue for you or a loved one. Some people may require ongoing support and treatment (rehabilitation) to help them recover. Making decisions about care If your loved one has been admitted to an ICU and is awake and able to communicate, they'll be fully involved in decisions about their care. But if they're unconscious or sedated, they may not be able to give their consent (permission) for a particular treatment or procedure. If they knew they were going into intensive care, they may have nominated someone to make decisions about treatment on their behalf (called a \"designated decision maker\") or made an advance decision about any treatments they don't want to have. If this wasn't possible in an emergency situation, the ICU staff treating them will usually decide what they feel is in their best interests. They will talk things over with you and\/or the person's family whenever possible. Read more about giving consent to treatment.

However, you may feel painful aching in your leg muscles that is triggered by physical activity, such as walking or climbing stairs. The pain, known as intermittent claudication, usually develops in your calves, but your hip, buttock or thigh muscles can be affected. The pain can range from mild to severe, and will usually go away after a few minutes when you rest your legs. Both legs are often affected at the same time, although the pain may be worse in one leg. Other symptoms of PAD can include: hair loss on your legs and feet numbness or weakness in the legs brittle, slow-growing toenails  ulcers (open sores) on your feet and legs, which don't heal changing skin colour on your legs, such as turning pale or blue shiny skin  in men, erectile dysfunction the muscles in your legs shrinking (wasting) The symptoms of PAD often develop slowly, over time. If your symptoms develop quickly, or get suddenly worse, it could be a sign of a serious problem requiring immediate treatment (see below). When to seek medical advice See your GP if you experience recurring episodes of leg pain after physical activity, especially if you smoke, or have a confirmed diagnosis of diabetes, high blood pressure and\/or high cholesterol. Many people mistakenly think recurring episodes of leg pain are part of growing older. This is not the case \u2013 there is no reason why an otherwise healthy person should experience leg pain. Read more about diagnosing PAD. When to seek urgent medical advice Some symptoms may suggest that the supply of blood to your legs has become severely restricted, and you may need to see a doctor urgently. These include: your symptoms getting suddenly worse constant leg pain, even when resting being unable to move the affected leg a sudden loss of normal sensation in the affected leg, or a burning or prickling sensation a difference in the colour and temperature of your legs persistent ulcers on one or both legs the muscles in your legs beginning to waste away the skin on your toes or lower limbs turning red and then black and\/or beginning to swell and produce foul-smelling pus, causing severe pain (gangrene) If you experience any of the problems listed above, contact your GP as soon as possible. If this is not possible, phone NHS 111 or your local out-of-hours service.  These symptoms could be a sign of a complication of PAD called critical limb ischemia (CLI), which requires urgent treatment.  Read more about the complications of PAD.

If you have a DSD, you will have a mix of male and female sexual characteristics. You may have the sex chromosomes (bundles of genes) normally associated with being female (XX chromosomes) or male (XY chromosomes), but your reproductive organs and genitals may be of the opposite sex, not clearly male nor female (ambiguous or atypical), or a mixture of both. This occurs because of a difference with your genetic make-up and\/or how you respond to the sex hormones in your body. These conditions can be inherited, but often they occur randomly for no apparent reason. Read more about genes and genetics. Types of DSDs There are different types of DSD, and each has a different cause. Below are some examples. Female with ambiguous or male-looking genitals Some people have XX (female) chromosomes with normal ovaries and womb, but their genitals appear ambiguous or male. For example, they may have an enlarged clitoris resembling a penis and their lower vagina may be closed. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX DSD. The most common cause is a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). If your child has CAH, they lack a particular enzyme (protein) that their body needs to make hormones called cortisol and aldosterone. Without these, the body produces more androgens (male sex hormones). If the affected child is female, then the raised androgen levels before birth cause the genitals to become more male in appearance. This condition can also lead to serious health issues, such as life-threatening kidney problems that need to be treated as soon as possible. For support and more information on CAH, you can visit the CAH support group. Female with normal external genitals but some internal male structures Some women have XY (male) chromosomes but their external genitals may appear entirely female or atypical. The womb may be present or absent and the testicles may be absent or not properly formed. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XY DSD. There are several different causes of this condition. One possible cause is androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), where the body ignores androgens or is insensitive to them, so development is female. The testes usually remain inside their body and the womb does not develop. AIS is thought to occur in around one in every 20,000 births, although the exact figures are unknown. For support and more information on AIS, you can visit the AIS Support Group.  A mix of male and female characteristics People with this very rare type of DSD have both ovarian and testicular tissue (for example, one ovary and one testis), and their genitals may appear female, male or a mix of both. Most people with this type of DSD have XX (female) chromosomes and, although the cause is not usually clear, some cases have been linked to genetic material normally found on the Y chromosome becoming misplaced on the X chromosome. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX ovotesticular DSD. Normally formed genitals but abnormal sexual development Some people have neither XY nor XX chromosomes \u2013 for example, they may only have one X chromosome (XO), or they may have an extra chromosome (XXY). Physically, their sex organs are normally formed as either male (testes and a penis) or female (ovaries, womb and a vagina), but they may not go through normal sexual development at puberty. For example, a child with female sex organs may not start having periods and may have small breasts. Doctors refer to this condition as sex chromosome DSD. About one in 600 newborn boys will have the genetic condition Klinefelter syndrome, which means they are born with an extra X chromosome (XXY). Adult males with Klinefelter syndrome may not be able to produce enough testosterone, the sex hormone responsible for the development of male characteristics and important for maintaining bone strength, libido and fertility in men. Girls or women with Turner syndrome are missing an X chromosome, which means they're usually infertile and their height is shorter than average. Female with an absent womb Some females are born with an underdeveloped or absent womb, cervix and upper vagina, but the ovaries and external genitalia (vulva) are still present and they still develop breasts and pubic hair as they get older. This is known as Rokitansky syndrome (also called Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser or MRKH syndrome). It\u2019s thought to affect around one in every 4,000 to 5,000 females. The cause of Rokitansky syndrome is not clear, but it\u2019s not related to the chromosomes because girls and women with it have the normal XX chromosomes. Often the first sign of Rokitansky syndrome is that a girl does not start having periods. Sex may also be difficult because the vagina is shorter than normal. As they have no womb, women with Rokitansky syndrome cannot become pregnant, but it\u2019s sometimes possible to take eggs from their ovaries, fertilise them, and implant them in another women (surrogate). For support and more information on Rokitansky syndrome, you can visit the websites of Living MRKH, the MRKH Organization and the Boston Center for Young Women\u2019s Health. What happens after birth Some cases of DSD are suspected soon after birth because of obvious signs such as undescended testicles or an atypical or ambiguous genital appearance. In such cases, a number of tests may be carried out to help confirm the diagnosis and identify any medical problems that may require immediate treatment. These tests may include a further physical examination of your baby carried out by a specialist, an ultrasound scan to examine their internal organs, and blood tests. Your care team may advise you to delay registering your child's birth for a few days while these tests are carried out. Afterwards, the results will be explained to you and you will have a discussion with specialists about whether to bring your baby up as a boy or a girl. Emergency treatment is rarely needed for a DSD, but the team of specialists can also talk to you about your options regarding immediate or delayed treatment with hormone therapy or surgery. Advice for parents of older children Sometimes a DSD may be diagnosed if an older child does not develop normally in puberty. For example, your child may not start the normal puberty changes or may start puberty but not start periods. You should speak to your GP if you have any concerns about your child\u2019s development at puberty. They should refer your child to a specialist, usually a consultant in paediatric endocrinology or an adolescent gynaecologist. A team of different healthcare professionals will work together to understand your child's condition and offer you and your child support and advice. As your child grows up, they may need hormone therapy and psychological support, and they may eventually decide they want surgery to change their physical appearance. With the right care and support, many people with DSDs come to terms with their condition and live happily. If you think you have a DSD If you think or know that you have a DSD, help and support is available. You should speak to your GP initially, as they will be able to refer you to a team of specialist healthcare professionals who can offer support and advice. Most people with a DSD stay with the gender they were assigned as a baby, but if you feel the gender you were assigned does not represent who you are, you may wish to change your gender. This will be something you can discuss with your team of specialists. If you have a DSD, you may be infertile and you may need hormone therapy and psychological support, but the right care and support can help you come to terms with your condition and lead a normal life. Support groups If you have a DSD, or you are the parent of a child who does, you may find it useful to contact or join a support group. These groups can often offer more information and advice about living with a DSD, and they may be able to put you in contact with others who have been in a similar situation to you. National DSD support groups include: DSD Families Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Support Group MRKH UK Your care team may also be able to recommend support groups in your local area. Terminology Disorders of sex development (DSDs) are also sometimes called intersex conditions. Some doctors also used to refer to a person with a DSD as a hermaphrodite. However, this term is longer used as it is misleading and can be insensitive. DSDs should not be confused with gender dysphoria, which is also known as transsexuality or being transgender. Gender dysphoria is where the reproductive organs and genitals have developed normally, but the person feels that their gender identity (their sense of what sex they are) does not match their biological sex.

It's also known as \"painful bladder syndrome\" or \"bladder pain syndrome\". The condition tends to first affect people in their 30s and 40s, and is much more common in women than men. It can have a significant impact on your lifestyle, work, emotional health and relationships, but a number of different treatments can be tried to help relieve the symptoms. Symptoms of interstitial cystitis The main symptoms of interstitial cystitis are: intense pelvic pain (felt below your bellybutton) sudden, strong urges to pee needing to pee more often than normal waking up several times during the night to go to the toilet The pain may be worse when your bladder is full and may be temporarily relieved when you go to the toilet. You might also find the pain is worse during periods or after having certain foods or drinks. The symptoms will often come and go in phases. You may have episodes lasting days, weeks or months where your symptoms improve, followed by times when they're worse. When to see your GP You should see your GP if you have persistent pelvic pain or you notice a change in your usual pattern of urination. These symptoms can have a number of causes, so it's a good idea to get a proper diagnosis. Your GP can refer you to a hospital specialist such as a urologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the urinary system) for further tests, such as a cystoscopy (a procedure to examine the inside of the bladder). What causes interstitial cystitis? The exact cause of interstitial cystitis isn't clear. Unlike other types of cystitis, there's no obvious infection in the bladder and antibiotics don't help. In some people with the condition, the bladder is inflamed, ulcerated, scarred or stiff. There are several theories about the possible cause of the condition, including: damage to the bladder lining, which may mean urine can irritate the bladder and surrounding muscles and nerves a problem with the pelvic floor muscles (used to control urination) your immune system mistakenly attacking your bladder an allergic reaction It's also been suggested that interstitial cystitis may be a symptom of a more widespread problem, as it's been associated with conditions such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and lupus. Treatments for interstitial cystitis Unfortunately, there's currently no cure for interstitial cystitis and it can be difficult to treat, although a number of treatments can be tried. No single treatment works for everyone, however, and there's disagreement about how effective some of them are. You may need to try several treatments to find one that works for you. Lifestyle changes will usually be recommended first. Medications and other therapies may be used if these don't help, and surgery may be necessary as a last resort. Lifestyle changes Lifestyle changes that may help improve your symptoms include: reducing stress \u2013 anything that helps you relax, such as exercise or regular warm baths, may help reduce your symptoms avoiding certain foods or drinks (such as tomatoes and alcohol) if you notice they make your symptoms worse \u2013 but don't make significant changes to your diet without seeking medical advice first stopping smoking \u2013 the chemicals you breathe in while smoking may irritate your bladder controlling how much you drink \u2013 try to reduce the amount you drink before going to bed planned toilet breaks \u2013 taking regular planned toilet breaks may help stop your bladder becoming too full You may also find it useful to contact a support group, such as the Interstitial Cystitis Association or the Cystitis and Overactive Bladder (COB) Foundation for information and advice about living with interstitial cystitis. Medication Tablets or capsules may be used to treat people with interstitial cystitis, including: over-the-counter painkillers \u2013 such as paracetamol and ibuprofen over-the-counter antihistamines \u2013 such as loratadine and cetirizine stronger painkillers available on prescription \u2013 such as amitriptyline, gabapentin and pregabalin tolterodine, solifenacin or mirabegron \u2013 these help relax the bladder muscles pentosan polysulphate sodium (Elmiron) \u2013 this may help repair the bladder lining Some medications can also be passed directly into the bladder using a thin tube called a catheter. These are known as intravesical medications or bladder instillations. Examples of intravesical medications include lignocaine (a local anaesthetic that numbs the bladder) and hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulphate (medications that may help restore the bladder lining). Supportive therapies and treatments Some people also find the following therapies and supportive treatments helpful: physiotherapy \u2013 massaging the pelvic floor muscles may help reduce any strain on your bladder bladder retraining \u2013 where you gradually learn to be able to hold more urine in your bladder before needing to go to the toilet psychological therapy \u2013 to help you cope with your symptoms and their impact on your life transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) \u2013 where a small battery-operated device is used to relieve pain by sending electrical impulses into your body Surgery and procedures Surgery and other procedures may be recommended if you have clear abnormal areas (lesions) in your bladder or other treatments don't work. Procedures that may be carried out include: cauterisation \u2013 where ulcers inside the bladder are sealed using an electrical current or laser bladder distension \u2013 where the bladder is stretched with fluid, which can aid diagnosis and may temporarily relieve your symptoms botulinum toxin injections \u2013 where a substance called botulinum toxin (such as Botox) is injected directly into your bladder to temporarily relieve your symptoms neuromodulation \u2013 where an implant that stimulates your nerves with electricity is placed in your body to relieve pain and reduce sudden urges to pee augmentation \u2013 making the bladder larger using part of the small intestine; this usually also includes removing any inflamed areas of the bladder In very rare cases, it may be necessary to remove the bladder completely (cystectomy). If this is done, your surgeon will need to create an alternative way for urine to leave your body. This will usually be through a small hole in your tummy called a stoma, but might involve making a new bladder using part of your small intestine (bladder reconstruction).

It's an uncommon condition, with many different possible causes. Acute IH occurs when the condition comes on rapidly \u2013 for example, as the result of a severe head injury, stroke or brain abscess. Acute IH is fatal if it's not treated promptly as a medical emergency \u2013 you will need to be admitted to hospital straight away. This page focuses on chronic IH \u2013 a severe, lifelong condition, usually caused by an underlying disease. Emergency treatment may also be required if chronic IH is caused by a build-up of fluid in the brain or a brain tumour (see below). However, there is sometimes no clear reason for the condition. This is often referred to as idiopathic intracranial hypertension \u2013 idiopathic means there is no known cause. What are the causes of chronic IH? Possible causes of chronic IH include: a brain tumour \u2013 such as a glioma or meningioma a brain infection \u2013 such as meningitis or encephalitis hydrocephalus \u2013 which is a build-up of fluid in the cavities of the brain blood vessel abnormalities \u2013 such as an arteriovenous fistula or arteriovenous malformation (an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein) blood clotting in one of the large veins of the brain \u2013 known as a venous sinus thrombosis, usually caused by infection or severe dehydration You can find a full list of medical conditions and medications associated with IH on the IIH UK website. Idiopathic IH Idiopathic IH means there is no obvious cause for the IH. It is most commonly seen in overweight women in their twenties. Experts do not fully understand the link between excess weight and IH, and losing weight can sometimes help reduce symptoms. Idiopathic IH is also associated with: hormone problems \u2013 such as vitamin D deficiency, Cushing's syndrome, hypoparathyroidism, underactive thyroid and overactive thyroid certain medications \u2013 including tetracycline, steroid medication, nitrofurantoin and oral contraceptives polycythaemia vera (having too many red blood cells) iron deficiency anaemia chronic kidney failure lupus (a problem with the immune system) Note that these conditions are only linked with idiopathic IH; they are not necessarily causes. What are the symptoms of chronic IH? Most people with chronic IH generally experience: severe throbbing headaches which are often constant, worse in the morning, aggravated by straining or coughing and associated with nausea and vomiting \u2013 they are sometimes relieved by standing changes in vision due to swollen optic nerves (known as papilloedema) \u2013 you may have blurred vision and find it difficult to watch TV or read; this can result in permanent visual impairment and may require urgent treatment after assessment by an opthalmologist You may also feel drowsy, confused and irritable, and have nausea and vomiting. Occasionally, you may hear a \"whooshing\" sound in your ears. How is chronic IH diagnosed? IH may be suspected if you have signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, such as vision problems and headaches. A diagnosis of IH is made by ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms. The following should apply: a neurological examination does not show any problem with nerve, spinal cord or brain function an opthalmology assessment may reveal eye changes a CT scan or MRI scan may look normal a lumbar puncture (see below) shows that you have high pressure in the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord you are awake and alert no other cause of increased intracranial pressure has been found How is chronic IH treated? The treatment you have depends on the underlying condition causing your IH. If you're overweight, it's important to lose weight. This often helps to reduce eye symptoms and can sometimes relieve symptoms altogether without the need for medical treatment. Medications You may be given any of the following medicines to treat the underlying cause and help to relieve symptoms: diuretic (medication to remove excess fluid from the body) a short dose of prednisolone (a steroid medication) to relieve headaches, especially if you're at risk of losing vision Lumbar punctures You may need regular lumbar punctures to remove excess cerebrospinal fluid from your spine and skull, and to help keep down intracranial pressure. This procedure involves taking a sample of fluid from inside your lower back using a needle and syringe. Surgery Surgery should be considered as a last resort if medication and weight loss fail to control your IH. You may be offered shunt surgery, where a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) is inserted into the fluid-filled space in your brain or spine to divert the excess fluid to another part of the body. The main types of shunt surgery are: lumboperitoneal shunting (shunting fluid from the spine to the abdomen) ventriculoperitoneal shunting (from the brain to the abdomen) ventriculoatrial shunting (from the brain to the heart) For many, shunt surgery provides long-term relief from symptoms. However, there is a small risk of complications, such as infection and blockage, which you should discuss with your surgeon. Rarely, if your vision is affected, you may need to have a procedure called an optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF). The surgeon will slit open the sheath surrounding your optic nerve to relieve the pressure on the nerve and allow the build-up of fluid to escape. ONSF is very effective at relieving this nerve pressure and helping to treat vision problems, but the amount of fluid removed is so small that it will not make a difference to the overall high pressure inside your skull and can lead to complications, including blindness. Your surgeon will explain all of these risks to you if you're considering this operation. Outlook Many patients with chronic IH find that their symptoms are relieved after treatment, although attacks of symptoms can recur. Chronic IH is a life-changing condition and your intracranial pressure will need to be continuously monitored for the rest of your life. One cause of intracranial hypertension: a haematoma (blood) can be seen building up on the right side of the skull    Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 20\/10\/2014 Next review due: 20\/10\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: IUD (intrauterine device) A woman can get pregnant if a man\u2019s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping eggs being produced. One method of contraception is the intrauterine device, or IUD (sometimes called a coil). At a glance: facts about the IUD   How the IUD works   Who can use the IUD   Advantages and disadvantages of the IUD   Risks of the IUD   Where you can get an IUD An IUD is a small T-shaped plastic and copper device that\u2019s inserted into your womb (uterus) by a specially trained doctor or nurse.  The IUD works by stopping the sperm and egg from surviving in the womb or fallopian tubes. It may also prevent a fertilised egg from implanting in the womb. The IUD is a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method. This means that once it's in place, you don't have to think about it each day or each time you have sex. There are several types and sizes of IUD. You can use an IUD whether or not you've had children.   At a glance: facts about the IUD There are different types of IUD, some with more copper than others. IUDs with more copper are more than 99% effective. This means that fewer than one in 100 women who use an IUD will get pregnant in one year. IUDs with less copper will be less effective.  An IUD works as soon as it's put in, and lasts for five to 10 years, depending on the type. It can be put in at any time during your menstrual cycle, as long as you're not pregnant. It can be removed at any time by a specially trained doctor or nurse and you'll quickly return to normal levels of fertility. Changes to your periods (for example, being heavier, longer or more painful) are common in the first three to six months after an IUD is put in, but they're likely to settle down after this. You might get spotting or bleeding between periods.  There's a very small chance of infection within 20 days of the IUD being fitted.  There's a risk that your body may expel the IUD. If you get pregnant, there's an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy (when the egg implants outside the womb). But because you're unlikely to get pregnant, the overall risk of ectopic pregnancy is lower than in women who don't use contraception.  Having the IUD put in can be uncomfortable. Ask the doctor or nurse about pain relief. An IUD may not be suitable for you if you've had previous pelvic infections. The IUD does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using condoms as well as the IUD, you'll help to protect yourself against STIs. How the IUD works How it prevents pregnancy Having an IUD fitted How to tell whether an IUD is still in place Removing an IUD How it prevents pregnancy The IUD is similar to the IUS (intrauterine system) but works in a different way. Instead of releasing the hormone progestogen like the IUS, the IUD releases copper. Copper changes the make-up of the fluids in the womb and fallopian tubes, stopping sperm surviving there. IUDs may also stop fertilised eggs from implanting in the womb. There are types and sizes of IUD to suit different women. IUDs need to be fitted by a trained doctor or nurse at your GP surgery, local contraception clinic or sexual health clinic. An IUD can stay in the womb for five to 10 years, depending on the type. If you're 40 or over when you have an IUD fitted, it can be left in until you reach the menopause or until you no longer need contraception. Having an IUD fitted An IUD can be fitted at any time during your menstrual cycle, as long as you are not pregnant. You'll be protected against pregnancy straight away. Before you have an IUD fitted, you will have an internal examination to find out the size and position of your womb. This is to make sure that the IUD can be put in the correct place. You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you You may also be tested for infections, such as STIs. It's best to do this before an IUD is fitted so that you can have treatment (if you need it) before the IUD is put in. Sometimes, you may be given antibiotics at the same time as the IUD is fitted. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to insert an IUD. The vagina is held open, like it is during a cervical screening (smear) test, and the IUD is inserted through the cervix and into the womb. The fitting process can be uncomfortable and sometimes painful. You may get cramps afterwards. You can ask for a local anaesthetic or painkillers before having the IUD fitted. An anaesthetic injection itself can be painful, so many women have the procedure without. You may get pain and bleeding for a few days after having an IUD fitted. Discuss this with your GP or nurse beforehand.   The IUD needs to be checked by a doctor after three to six weeks. Speak to your doctor or nurse if you have any problems before or after this first check or if you want the IUD removed. Speak to your doctor or nurse if you or your partner are at risk of getting an STI. This is because STIs can lead to an infection in the pelvis. See your GP or go back to the clinic where your IUD was fitted as soon as you can if you: have pain in your lower abdomen have a high temperature have a smelly discharge These may mean you have an infection. How to tell whether an IUD is still in place An IUD has two thin threads that hang down a little way from your womb into the top of your vagina. The doctor or nurse who fits your IUD will teach you how to feel for these threads and check that it is still in place. Check your IUD is in place a few times in the first month, and then after each period or at regular intervals.  It's very unlikely that your IUD will come out, but if you can't feel the threads, or if you think the IUD has moved, you may not be fully protected against getting pregnant. See your doctor or nurse straight away and use an extra method of contraception, such as condoms, until your IUD has been checked. If you've had sex recently, you may need to use emergency contraception. Your partner shouldn't be able to feel your IUD during sex. If he can feel the threads, get your doctor or nurse to check that your IUD is in place. They may be able to cut the threads to a shorter length. If you feel any pain during sex, go for a check-up. Removing an IUD An IUD can be removed at any time by a trained doctor or nurse. If you're not going to have another IUD put in and you don't want to get pregnant, use another method (such as condoms) for seven days before you have the IUD removed. This is to stop sperm getting into your body. Sperm can live for up to seven days in the body and could make you pregnant once the IUD is removed. As soon as an IUD is taken out, your normal fertility should return.  Who can use an IUD Most women can use an IUD. This includes women who have never been pregnant and those who are HIV positive. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your medical history to check if an IUD is the most suitable form of contraception for you. You should not use an IUD if you have: an untreated STI or a pelvic infection  problems with your womb or cervix  any unexplained bleeding from your vagina \u2013 for example, between periods or after sex Women who have had an ectopic pregnancy or recent abortion, or who have an artificial heart valve, must consult their GP or clinician before having an IUD fitted. You should not be fitted with an IUD if there's a chance that you are already pregnant or if you or your partner are at risk of catching STIs. If you or your partner are unsure, go to your GP or a sexual health clinic to be tested. Using an IUD after giving birth An IUD can usually be fitted four to six weeks after giving birth (vaginal or caesarean). You'll need to use alternative contraception from three weeks (21 days) after the birth until the IUD is fitted. In some cases, an IUD can be fitted within 48 hours of giving birth. An IUD is safe to use when you're breastfeeding and it won't affect your milk supply. Using an IUD after a miscarriage or abortion An IUD can be fitted straight away or within 48 hours after an abortion or miscarriage by an experienced doctor or nurse, as long as you were pregnant for less than 24 weeks. If you were pregnant for more than 24 weeks, you may have to wait a few weeks before having an IUD fitted.  Advantages and disadvantages of the IUD Although an IUD is an effective method of contraception, there are some things to consider before having one fitted. Advantages of the IUD Most women can use an IUD, including women who have never been pregnant. Once an IUD is fitted, it works straight away and lasts for up to 10 years or until it's removed. It doesn't interrupt sex. It can be used if you're breastfeeding. Your normal fertility returns as soon as the IUD is taken out It's not affected by other medicines. There's no evidence that having an IUD fitted will increase the risk of cancer of the cervix, endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the womb) or ovarian cancer. Some women experience changes in mood and libido, but these changes are very small. There is no evidence that the IUD affects weight. Disadvantages of the IUD Your periods may become heavier, longer or more painful, though this may improve after a few months.  An IUD doesn't protect against STIs, so you may have to use condoms as well. If you get an STI while you have an IUD, it could lead to a pelvic infection if not treated. The most common reasons that women stop using an IUD are vaginal bleeding and pain. Risks of the IUD Complications after having an IUD fitted are rare. Most will appear within the first year after fitting. Damage to the womb In fewer than one in 1,000 cases, an IUD can perforate (make a hole in) the womb or neck of the womb (cervix) when it's put in. This can cause pain in the lower abdomen, but doesn't usually cause any other symptoms. If the doctor or nurse fitting your IUD is experienced, the risk of this is very low. If perforation occurs, you may need surgery to remove the IUD. Contact your GP straight away if you feel a lot of pain after having an IUD fitted as perforations should be treated immediately. Pelvic infections Pelvic infections can occur in the first 20 days after the IUD is fitted. The risk of infection is very small. Fewer than one in 100 women who are at low risk of STIs will get a pelvic infection. Rejection Occasionally, the IUD is rejected (expelled) by the womb or can move (this is called displacement). This is more likely to happen soon after it has been fitted, although this is uncommon. Your doctor or nurse will teach you how to check that your IUD is in place. Ectopic pregnancy If the IUD fails and you become pregnant, your IUD should be removed as soon as possible if you're going to continue with the pregnancy. There's a small increased risk of ectopic pregnancy if a woman becomes pregnant while using an IUD. Where to get an IUD Most types of contraception are available free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics sexual health clinics \u2013 these offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people\u2019s services (call the sexual health line on 0300 123 7123 for details) Find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching your postcode or town. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacists won't tell your parents or carer, as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.   Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 12\/01\/2015 Next review due: 12\/01\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's also known as intrauterine insemination (IUI). Artificial insemination on the NHS The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that up to six cycles of IUI treatment on the NHS may be offered if: you're unable (or would find it very difficult) to have vaginal sex \u2013 for example, because of a physical disability or psychosexual problem you have a condition (such as a viral infection that can be sexually transmitted) that means you need specific help to conceive you're in a same-sex relationship If six cycles don't work, you may sometimes be able to have a further six cycles before in vitro fertilisation (IVF) is considered. Previously, IUI treatment on the NHS was offered if a man had mild fertility problems, a woman had mild endometriosis, or a couple had unexplained infertility. However, guidelines now state that IUI shouldn't be offered in these circumstances. Instead, you should be advised to keep trying to conceive through regular unprotected sex for a total of two years. After this time has elapsed, you may be offered IVF. Availability The availability of artificial insemination on the NHS varies throughout the UK. In some areas, the waiting list for treatment can be very long. The criteria that must be met to be eligible for treatment can also vary. IUI is also available from some private fertility clinics. Costs vary, but usually range from around £500 to £1,000 for each cycle of treatment. What happens Assessment Before IUI is carried out, a couple\u2019s fertility may need to be assessed to find out why they are having difficulty conceiving and to determine whether artificial insemination is suitable. Read more about diagnosing infertility. For a woman to have IUI, her fallopian tubes (the tubes connecting the ovaries to the womb) must be open and healthy, because this is where the sperm will fertilise the egg and how the resulting embryo moves down into the womb. The fallopian tubes can be assessed using one of three methods: a laparoscopy \u2013 where a thin, tubular microscope inserted through a small cut in the tummy is used to look closely at the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries hysterosalpingogram \u2013 an X-ray of the womb and fallopian tubes taken after a special dye has been injected hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy) \u2013 which involves carrying out a vaginal ultrasound scan to check the fallopian tubes for blockages Timing of treatment To maximise the chances of success, a cycle of IUI should be carried out just after ovulation. It's difficult to predict exactly when this will occur, but in most women it usually happens between 12 and 16 days after they have their period. You may be given an ovulation prediction kit (OPK) to work out the date of ovulation with greater accuracy. An OPK device can detect hormones released during ovulation in urine or saliva. Alternatively, blood tests may be used to find out when you are about to ovulate. Occasionally, fertility medication is used to stimulate ovulation. In these cases, vaginal ultrasound scans are used to track the development of your eggs. As soon as an egg is mature, you will be given a hormone injection to stimulate its release. IUI using a partner\u2019s sperm If a couple decides to have IUI using their own sperm, the man will be asked to provide a sperm sample at the fertility clinic by masturbating into a specimen cup, usually on the same day that IUI treatment takes place. The sperm sample will be \"washed\" and filtered using special equipment to remove any dead sperm and impurities. The faster-moving sperm will be kept and any slow-moving sperm will be removed. This produces a concentrated sample of healthy sperm. An instrument called a speculum is inserted into the woman's vagina to keep it open. A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is then placed inside the vagina and guided into the womb. This process is mostly painless, although some women experience mild, short-lived cramping. The sperm sample will then be passed through the catheter and into the womb. The process usually takes no more than 10 minutes, and the couple should be able to go home shortly after the procedure is finished. IUI using a donor\u2019s sperm If a male partner cannot produce healthy sperm, or a same-sex couple are having IUI, frozen sperm from a donor is used. This can be from someone the couple knows, although sperm is usually obtained from a registered or licensed sperm bank.  Choosing to use donated sperm can be a difficult decision, and a couple will often have counselling before a decision is made by the clinic to proceed. Read more about using a sperm donor. If a couple decides to have IUI using the sperm of a donor, the same procedure is used. However, a sample of frozen sperm from a donor will be thawed out before being \"washed\" and inserted into the woman's womb. All donated sperm is carefully checked for: infections, such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C genetic and hereditary disorders, such as sickle-cell anaemia and cystic fibrosis The sperm bank can provide information about the physical characteristics of available donors, such as their ethnicity, physical build, and hair and eye colour. This will enable a couple to try to match a potential donor\u2019s characteristics with their own. Chances of success Figures from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) suggest that each cycle of IUI with donor sperm has a success rate of: 15.8% for women under 35  11.0% for women aged 35-39  4.7% for women aged 40-42  1.2% for women aged 43-44  0% for women over 44  As well as the woman's age, the changes of success can also be affected by the sperm count and sperm quality (using fresh sperm is associated with higher conception rates than frozen and thawed sperm) and technical aspects of IUI, such as working out the time of ovulation correctly. Overall, more than half of the women who have IUI will become pregnant during the first six treatment cycles. If IUI fails after several attempts, your doctor may suggest trying another treatment, such as IVF. Are there any risks? Risks involved with IUI are minimal, although some women experience mild cramps similar to period pains. In cases where medication is used to stimulate ovulation, there is a small risk of a reaction to the medication and a chance of an unintended multiple pregnancy (such as twins or triplets). You\u2019ll be monitored with ultrasound scans to check for a potential multiple pregnancy and the treatment cycle can be abandoned if necessary to avoid this.

Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the IUS, or intrauterine system (sometimes called the hormonal coil). At a glance: facts about the IUS   How the IUS works   Who can use the IUS   Advantages and disadvantages of the IUS   Risks of the IUS   Where to get the IUS An IUS is a small, T-shaped plastic device that is inserted into your womb (uterus) by a specially trained doctor or nurse. The IUS releases a progestogen hormone into the womb. This thickens the mucus from your cervix, making it difficult for sperm to move through and reach an egg. It also thins the womb lining so that it's less likely to accept a fertilised egg. It may also stop ovulation (the release of an egg) in some women. The IUS is a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method. It works for five years or three years, depending on the type, so you don't have to think about contraception every day or each time you have sex. Two brands of IUS are used in the UK \u2013 Mirena and Jaydess.  You can use an IUS whether or not you've had children. At a glance: facts about the IUS   It's more than 99% effective. Less than one in every 100 women who use Mirena will get pregnant in five years, and less than one in 100 who use Jaydess will get pregnant in three years. It can be taken out at any time by a specially trained doctor or nurse and your fertility quickly returns to normal. The IUS can make your periods lighter, shorter or stop altogether, so it may help women who have heavy periods or painful periods. Jaydess is less likely than Mirena to make your periods stop altogether. It can be used by women who can't use combined contraception (such as the combined pill) \u2013 for example, those who have migraines. Once the IUS is in place, you don't have to think about contraception every day or each time you have sex. Some women may experience mood swings, skin problems or breast tenderness.   There's a small risk of getting an infection after it's inserted. It can be uncomfortable when the IUS is put in, although painkillers can help with this. The IUS can be fitted at any time during your monthly menstrual cycle, as long as you're definitely not pregnant. Ideally, it should be fitted within seven days of the start of your period, because this will protect against pregnancy straight away. You should use condoms for seven days if the IUS is fitted at any other time. The IUS does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using condoms as well as the IUS, you'll help to protect yourself against STIs.   How the IUS works How it prevents pregnancy  Having an IUS fitted How to tell whether an IUS is still in place Removing an IUS How it prevents pregnancy The IUS is similar to the IUD (intrauterine device), but works in a slightly different way. Rather than releasing copper like the IUD, the IUS releases a progestogen hormone, which is similar to the natural hormone progesterone that's produced in a woman's ovaries. Progestogen thickens the mucus from the cervix (opening of the womb), making it harder for sperm to move through it and reach an egg. It also causes the womb lining to become thinner and less likely to accept a fertilised egg. In some women, the IUS also stops the ovaries from releasing an egg (ovulation), but most women will continue to ovulate. If you're 45 or older when you have the IUS fitted, it can be left until you reach menopause or you no longer need contraception. Having an IUS fitted You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you An IUS can be fitted at any stage of your menstrual cycle, as long as you are not pregnant. If it's fitted in the first seven days of your cycle, you will be protected against pregnancy straight away. If it's fitted at any other time, you need to use another method of contraception (such as condoms) for seven days after it's fitted. Before you have an IUS fitted, you will have an internal examination to determine the size and position of your womb. This is to make sure that the IUS can be positioned in the correct place. You may also be tested for any existing infections, such as STIs. It is best to do this before an IUS is fitted so that any infections can be treated. You may be given antibiotics at the same time as an IUS is fitted. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to insert an IUS: the vagina is held open, like it is during a cervical screening (smear) test the IUS is inserted through the cervix and into the womb The fitting process can be uncomfortable or painful for some women, and you may also experience cramps afterwards. You can ask for a local anaesthetic or painkillers before having the IUS fitted. Discuss this with your GP or nurse beforehand. An anaesthetic injection itself can be painful, so many women have the procedure without one. Once an IUS is fitted, it will need to be checked by a doctor after three to six weeks to make sure everything is fine. Speak to your GP or clinician if you have any problems after this initial check or if you want the IUS removed. Also speak to your GP if you or your partner are at risk of getting an STI, as this can lead to infection in the pelvis. See your GP or go back to the clinic if you: have pain in your lower abdomen have a high temperature have smelly discharge This may mean you have an infection. How to tell if an IUS is still in place An IUS has two thin threads that hang down a little way from your womb into the top of your vagina. The GP or clinician that fits your IUS will teach you how to feel for these threads and check that the IUS is still in place. Check your IUS is in place a few times in the first month and then after each period at regular intervals. It is highly unlikely that your IUS will come out, but if you can't feel the threads or if you think the IUS has moved, you may not be fully protected against pregnancy. See your doctor or nurse straight away and use extra contraception, such as condoms, until your IUS has been checked. If you've had sex recently, you may need to use emergency contraception. Your partner shouldn't be able to feel your IUS during sex. If he can feel the threads, get your GP or clinician to check that your IUS is in place. They may be able to cut the threads a little. If you feel any pain during sex, go for a check-up with your GP or clinician. Removing an IUS Your IUS can be removed at any time by a trained doctor or nurse. If you're not going to have another IUS put in and you don't want to become pregnant, use another contraceptive method (such as condoms) for seven days before you have the IUS removed. Sperm can live for seven days in the body and could fertilise an egg once the IUS is removed. As soon as an IUS is taken out, your normal fertility should return. Who can use an IUS Most women can use an IUS, including women who have never been pregnant and those who are HIV positive. Your GP or clinician will ask about your medical history to check if an IUS is the most suitable form of contraception for you. Your family and medical history will determine whether or not you can use an IUS. For example, this method of contraception may not be suitable for you if you have: breast cancer, or have had it in the past five years cervical cancer  liver disease unexplained vaginal bleeding between periods or after sex arterial disease or history of serious heart disease or stroke an untreated STI or pelvic infection problems with your womb or cervix An IUS may not be suitable for women who have untreated STIs. A doctor will usually give you a check-up to make sure you don't have any existing infections. Using an IUS after giving birth An IUS can usually be fitted four to six weeks after giving birth (vaginal or caesarean). You'll need to use alternative contraception from three weeks (21 days) after the birth until the IUS is put in. In some cases, an IUS can be fitted within 48 hours of giving birth. It is safe to use an IUS when you're breastfeeding, and it won't affect your milk supply. Using an IUS after a miscarriage or abortion An IUS can be fitted by an experienced doctor or nurse straight after an abortion or miscarriage, as long as you were pregnant for less than 24 weeks. If you were pregnant for more than 24 weeks, you may have to wait a few weeks before an IUS can be fitted. Advantages and disadvantages of the IUS Although an IUS is an effective method of contraception, there are several things to consider before having an IUS fitted. Advantages of the IUS It works for five years (Mirena) or three years (Jaydess).  It's one of the most effective forms of contraception available in the UK. It doesn't interrupt sex. An IUS may be useful if you have heavy or painful periods because your periods usually become much lighter and shorter, and sometimes less painful \u2013 they may stop completely after the first year of use. It can be used safely if you're breastfeeding.  It's not affected by other medicines. It may be a good option if you can't take the hormone oestrogen, which is used in the combined contraceptive pill.  Your fertility will return to normal when the IUS is removed. There's no evidence that an IUS will affect your weight or that having an IUS fitted will increase the risk of cervical cancer, cancer of the uterus or ovarian cancer. Some women experience changes in mood and libido, but these changes are very small. Disadvantages of the IUS Some women won't be happy with the way that their periods may change. For example, periods may become lighter and more irregular or, in some cases, stop completely. Your periods are more likely to stop completely with Mirena than with Jaydess. Irregular bleeding and spotting are common in the first six months after having an IUS fitted. This is not harmful and usually decreases with time. Some women experience headaches, acne and breast tenderness after having the IUS fitted. An uncommon side effect of the IUS is the appearance of small fluid-filled cysts on the ovaries \u2013 these usually disappear without treatment. An IUS doesn't protect you against STIs, so you may also have to use condoms when having sex. If you get an STI while you have an IUS fitted, it could lead to pelvic infection if it's not treated. Most women who stop using an IUS do so because of vaginal bleeding and pain, although this is uncommon. Hormonal problems can also occur, but these are even less common. Risks of the IUS Complications caused by an IUS are rare and usually happen in the first six months after it has been fitted. These include: Damage to the womb In rare cases (fewer than one in 1,000 insertions) an IUS can perforate (make a hole in) the womb or neck of the womb (cervix) when it is put in. This can cause pain in the lower abdomen, but doesn't usually cause any other symptoms. If the doctor or nurse fitting your IUS is experienced, the risk of perforation is extremely low. If perforation occurs, you may need surgery to remove the IUS. Contact your GP straight away if you feel a lot of pain after having an IUS fitted. Perforations should be treated immediately. Pelvic infections Pelvic infections may occur in the first 20 days after the IUS has been inserted. The risk of infection from an IUS is extremely small (fewer than one in 100 women who are at low risk of STIs will get an infection). A GP or clinician will usually recommend an internal examination before fitting an IUS to be sure that there are no existing infections. Rejection Occasionally, the IUS is rejected (expelled) by the womb or it can move (this is called displacement). This is not common and is more likely to happen soon after it has been fitted. Your doctor or nurse will teach you how to check that your IUS is in place. Ectopic pregnancy If the IUS fails and you become pregnant, your IUS should be removed as soon as possible if you are continuing with the pregnancy. There's a small increased risk of ectopic pregnancy if a woman becomes pregnant while using an IUS. Where to get the IUS Most types of contraception are available for free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics sexual health clinics \u2013 they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people\u2019s services (call 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find sexual health services near you, including contraception clinics. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won't tell your parents or carer as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.

The uvea is made up of the iris (the coloured part of the eye), the ciliary body (the ring of muscle behind the iris), and the choroid (the layer of tissue that supports the retina). Symptoms of uveitis include: a painful red eye \u2013 the pain can range from mild aching to intense discomfort, and focusing your eye can make the pain worse; the eye can feel tender or bruised blurred or cloudy vision \u2013 this may come after other symptoms sensitivity to light (photophobia) marked or new floaters \u2013 shadows, webs, dots or veils that move across the field of vision loss of peripheral vision (the ability to see objects at the side of your field of vision) a pupil shaped differently or that doesn't get smaller when reacting to light headaches One or both eyes may be affected by uveitis. The symptoms can develop suddenly or gradually over a few days. People with long-term uveitis tend to have more visual symptoms and their eyes may look normal. Patients with sudden onset uveitis usually have more pain and tenderness. When to seek medical advice Contact your GP as soon as possible if you have persistent eye pain or you notice an unusual change in your vision, particularly if you've had previous episodes of uveitis. The sooner uveitis is treated, the more successful treatment is likely to be. Your GP may refer you to an ophthalmologist, who is a specialist in eye conditions. An ophthalmologist will examine your eye in more detail with a microscope and light (a slit-lamp), and may suggest further tests if uveitis is diagnosed. This may include scans of your eyes, X-rays and blood tests. Knowing the cause of your uveitis will help determine the treatment needed. Why does uveitis happen? There are a wide range of potential causes for uveitis, although a specific cause is not always identified. Many cases are thought to be the result of a problem with the immune system (the body's defence against illness and infection). For unknown reasons, the immune system can become overactive in the eye. Less commonly, uveitis can be caused by an infection or injury to the eye, and it can also happen after eye surgery. Read more about the causes of uveitis. Types of uveitis There are different types of uveitis, depending on which part of the eye is affected: anterior uveitis \u2013 inflammation of the iris (iritis) or inflammation of the iris and the ciliary body (iridocyclitis); this is the most common type of uveitis, accounting for about three out of four cases, tends to come on quickly, and can be recurrent, causing pain and redness intermediate uveitis \u2013 inflammation of the area behind the ciliary body and the vitreous jelly; this can cause floaters and blurred vision posterior uveitis \u2013 inflammation at the back of the eye, the choroid and the retina; this can cause problems with vision In some cases, uveitis can affect the front and back of the eye. This is known as panuveitis. How is uveitis treated? The main treatment of uveitis is steroid medication (corticosteroids), which can reduce inflammation inside the eye. The type of steroid medication used depends on the type of uveitis you have. Eye drops are often used for uveitis affecting the front of the eye, whereas injections, tablets and capsules are more often used to treat uveitis affecting the middle and back of the eye. In some cases, additional treatment may be needed. This might be eye drops to relieve pain, a type of medicine called an immunosuppressant, and even surgery. Uveitis caused by infection needs specific treatment. Read more about treating uveitis. How long can it last? Uveitis can be: acute \u2013 when it resolves quickly after treatment recurrent \u2013 when repeated episodes are separated by gaps of several months chronic \u2013 when the condition continues long-term or requires long-term medication to control it Complications Although most cases of uveitis respond quickly to treatment and cause no further problems, there is a risk of complications. The risk is higher in people who have intermediate or posterior uveitis, or have repeated episodes of uveitis. Complications of uveitis include permanent damage of the eye and some loss of vision. It's estimated that the more serious types of uveitis are responsible for 1 in every 10 cases of visual impairment in the UK. Read more about the possible complications of uveitis. Who is affected? Uveitis is uncommon. It's estimated that 2 to 5 in every 10,000 people will be affected by uveitis in the UK every year. It usually affects people aged 20 to 59, but can also occur in children. Men and women are affected equally. It's more likely to occur in people with other inflammatory or immune conditions. Despite being uncommon, uveitis is a leading cause of visual impairment in the UK. This is why it's very important to diagnose and treat the condition as early as possible. Information about you If you have uveitis, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).

Iron is used to produce red blood cells, which help store and carry oxygen in the blood. If you have fewer red blood cells than is normal, your organs and tissues won't get as much oxygen as they usually would. There are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type. Other types of anaemia can be caused by a lack of vitamin B12 or folate in the body \u2013 read more about vitamin B12 and folate deficiency anaemia. Symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia Many people with iron deficiency anaemia only have a few symptoms. The severity of the symptoms largely depends on how quickly anaemia develops. You may notice symptoms immediately, or they may develop gradually if your anaemia is caused by a long-term problem, such as a stomach ulcer. The most common symptoms include: tiredness and lack of energy (lethargy) shortness of breath  noticeable heartbeats (heart palpitations) a pale complexion Less common symptoms include: headache  hearing sounds that come from inside the body, rather than from an outside source (tinnitus) an altered sense of taste feeling itchy a sore or abnormally smooth tongue hair loss a desire to eat non-food items, such as ice, paper or clay (pica) difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) painful open sores (ulcers) on the corners of your mouth spoon-shaped nails When to see your GP See your GP if you experience symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia. They should be able to diagnose the condition using a simple blood test. Read more about diagnosing iron deficiency anaemia. What causes iron deficiency anaemia? There are many things that can lead to a lack of iron in the body. In men and post-menopausal women, the most common cause is bleeding in the stomach and intestines. This can be caused by a stomach ulcer, stomach cancer, bowel cancer, or by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In women of reproductive age, heavy periods and pregnancy are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia as your body needs extra iron for your baby during pregnancy. Unless you're pregnant, it's rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused just by a lack of iron in your diet. However, if you do lack dietary iron, it may mean you're more likely to develop anaemia than if you have one of the problems mentioned above. Read more about the causes of iron deficiency anaemia. How iron deficiency anaemia is treated Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia involves taking iron supplements to boost the low levels of iron in your body. This is usually effective, and the condition rarely causes long-term problems. You'll need to be monitored every few months to check the treatment is working and your iron levels have returned to normal. The underlying cause will need to be treated so you don't get anaemia again. Increasing the amount of iron in your diet may also be recommended. Good sources of iron include: dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale iron-fortified cereals or bread brown rice  pulses and beans nuts and seeds meat, fish and tofu eggs dried fruit, such as dried apricots, prunes and raisins Read more about treating iron deficiency anaemia. Further problems If iron deficiency anaemia is left untreated, it can make you more susceptible to illness and infection, as a lack of iron affects the body's natural defence system (the immune system). Severe iron deficiency anaemia may increase your risk of developing complications that affect the heart or lungs, such as an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) or heart failure, where your heart is unable to pump enough blood around your body at the right pressure. Pregnant women with severe or untreated anaemia also have a higher risk of complications before and after birth. Read more about the complications of iron deficiency anaemia.

The excess levels of iron can then trigger symptoms such as: feeling very tired all the time (fatigue) joint pain in men \u2013 inability to get or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction) in women \u2013 absent periods Read more about symptoms of haemochromatosis. What causes haemochromatosis? Haemochromatosis is an inherited condition caused by a faulty gene called HFE, that allows a person to absorb too much iron from food. Normally, the body only absorbs as much as it needs. The excess iron starts building up in the body and causing problems. Read more about the causes of haemochromatosis. Complications If haemochromatosis is left untreated, the extra iron accumulates in the body, usually in organs, such as the heart and liver. This can lead to potentially serious complications such as: liver disease \u2013 including scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) or liver cancer heart failure \u2013 where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body Read more about complications of haemochromatosis. Treatment Haemochromatosis responds well to treatment, which aims to remove excess iron from the body. The usual treatment is quite simple. Blood is removed from the body on a regular basis \u2013 about the same amount taken in a blood donation, around 500ml (roughly a pint). This leads to an overall drop in iron levels. For people unable to use phlebotomy for medical reasons, a medication called deferasirox can be used as an alternative. This is known as chelation therapy. Read more about treating haemochromatosis. Screening Routine screening for haemochromatosis is not offered by the NHS because it's a relatively uncommon condition. However, if a close family member (a parent, brother or sister) is diagnosed with haemochromatosis you may want to consider getting tested for the condition yourself. Initial screening is done by blood test. Read more about diagnosing haemochromatosis. Living with haemochromatosis Most people will be able to keep their haemochromatosis symptoms under control, but there are steps that can be taken to keep iron levels low and prevent complications. For example: avoid taking iron supplements and eating foods fortified with iron, such as breakfast cereals reduce the amount of vitamin C you consume, as this increases absorption of iron and helps it deposit in some organs avoid drinking too much alcohol, especially with meals, as this can increase iron absorption and cause liver disease \u2013 if you do have some degree of liver disease you may be advised to avoid alcohol completely Who is affected Haemochromatosis is uncommon in general terms, although it's one of the most common genetic (inherited) conditions in England. As many as one person in 200 may be affected. Symptoms usually start in adults between the ages of 30-50. Symptoms in women are often delayed because their iron levels are reduced when they have a period. Haemochromatosis is most common in people of white European ethnic background \u2013 particularly people of Irish descent.

Haemochromatosis Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video. Alan was 55 when he was diagnosed with haemochromatosis or iron overload disorder \u2013 a condition where the body contains too much iron. He describes how he learned to manage the condition by changing his diet and having venesection treatment several times a year. Media last reviewed: 20\/05\/2016 Next review due: 20\/05\/2018 Role of iron in the body The main role of iron in the body is to help transport oxygen in the blood to vital organs. Iron combines with a protein in red blood cells to form a substance called haemoglobin. When we breathe in, the oxygen in our lungs is attracted to the iron in haemoglobin and combines with it to form oxyhaemoglobin. This is transported around the body by blood cells, and oxygen released wherever needed. Iron overload Having too much iron in your body is known as iron overload. Causes of iron overload other than haemochromatosis include: the blood disorder thalassaemia chronic liver disease having a condition that requires frequent blood transfusion, such as sickle cell anaemia drinking beer brewed in iron containers  excess iron intake from iron pills or injections long-term dialysis rare inherited diseases that affect red blood cells, such as atransferrinaemia or aceruloplasminaemia Page last reviewed: 29\/07\/2014 Next review due: 29\/11\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Your heart may feel like it's pounding, fluttering or beating irregularly, often for just a few seconds or minutes. You may also feel these sensations in your throat or neck. Palpitations may seem alarming, but in most cases they're harmless and are not a sign of a problem with your heart. Sometimes you may feel an extra or missed beat. These are known as 'ectopic beats', and are also usually nothing to worry about. However, palpitations accompanied by other symptoms, such as dizziness or tightness in your chest, can sometimes be a sign of a heart problem (see below). You should visit your GP if you have palpitations along with other symptoms or if you're concerned. What causes heart palpitations? Lifestyle triggers Palpitations may be triggered by a surge of adrenaline, a hormone your body releases after you have overexerted yourself or when you feel nervous, anxious or excited. Eating rich, spicy foods, drinking excessive amounts of caffeine or alcohol, smoking, and using recreational drugs can all bring on palpitations. If you think lifestyle factors are causing your palpitations, try to reduce your stress levels by using relaxation techniques and moderating the level of exercise you do. You should also reduce your intake of coffee or energy drinks and avoid using recreational drugs. Panic attacks If you have regular palpitations and also have feelings of anxiety, stress and panic, you may be experiencing panic attacks. A panic attack can cause an overwhelming sense of anxiety, fear and apprehension, accompanied by nausea, sweating, trembling and palpitations. Panic attacks can be frightening and intense, but aren't usually dangerous. Read more about panic attacks. Medication Less commonly, palpitations can be a side effect of some types of medicine, such as asthma inhalers or tablets for a thyroid problem. Speak to your GP if you think medication may be responsible for your palpitations. Don't stop taking a prescribed treatment without first consulting your GP. Periods, pregnancy and the menopause Palpitations can sometimes be the result of hormonal changes during a woman's periods, during pregnancy, or around the time of the menopause. However, these are usually only temporary and not a cause for concern. Medical conditions The following conditions can make the heart beat faster, stronger or irregularly, and can be a cause of heart palpitations: an overactive thyroid a low blood sugar level anaemia some types of low blood pressure  a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above  dehydration (not enough fluid in the body) a heart problem (see below) When you may have a heart problem If you start to experience palpitations more often, or if they get worse or occur with other symptoms such as dizziness or tightness in your chest, see your GP. You may have a heart rhythm problem (arrhythmia), such as atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). There are also other, less common, heart rhythm conditions that may be the cause of your palpitations. These can be determined by appropriate tests. When your GP or hospital discovers the exact problem with your heart, ask them to explain it to you. Seeing your GP Your GP will often carry out an electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess your heart rate and rhythm. This may immediately confirm whether there's a problem and whether treatment is needed. However, the results of an ECG will often be completely normal if you're not having palpitations at the time of the test. Further tests may be needed, which may be carried out by your GP or local hospital. Atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common heart rhythm problems and is a major cause of stroke (a serious medical condition that can cause permanent disability). In the UK, atrial fibrillation affects up to 800,000 people, and is most common in those over 55 years of age. It causes a fast, irregular pulse, which can cause a persistent heart flutter. You may also feel dizzy, short of breath and very tired. Atrial fibrillation is not usually life threatening, but can be uncomfortable and often needs treating. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a similar heart rhythm problem to atrial fibrillation. It also causes episodes of an abnormally fast heart rate, but the heart rate is often steady and not irregular. Episodes of SVT are usually harmless and tend to settle down on their own without the need for treatment. However, you should seek medical advice if you have prolonged episodes of SVT.

It can cause bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and\/or constipation. The symptoms vary between individuals and affect some people more severely than others. They tend to come and go in periods lasting a few days to a few months at a time, often during times of stress or after eating certain foods. You may find some of the symptoms of IBS ease after going to the toilet and opening your bowels. IBS is thought to affect up to one in five people at some point in their life, and it usually first develops when a person is between 20 and 30 years of age. Around twice as many women are affected as men. The condition is often lifelong, although it may improve over several years. Read more about the symptoms of IBS. When to see your GP See your GP if you think you have IBS symptoms, so they can try to determine the cause. Your GP may be able to identify IBS based on your symptoms, although blood tests may be needed to rule out other conditions. Read more about diagnosing IBS. What causes IBS? The exact cause of IBS is unknown, but most experts think that it's related to increased sensitivity of the gut and problems digesting food. These problems may mean that you are more sensitive to pain coming from your gut, and you may become constipated or have diarrhoea because your food passes through your gut either too slowly or too quickly. Psychological factors such as stress may also play a part in IBS. Read more about the causes of IBS. How IBS is treated There is no cure for IBS, but the symptoms can often be managed by making changes to your diet and lifestyle. For example, it may help to: identify and avoid foods or drinks that trigger your symptoms alter the amount of fibre in your diet exercise regularly reduce your stress levels Medication is sometimes prescribed for people with IBS to treat the individual symptoms they experience. Read more about treating IBS. Living with IBS IBS is unpredictable. You may go for many months without any symptoms, then have a sudden flare-up. The condition can also be painful and debilitating, which can have a negative impact on your quality of life and emotional state. Many people with IBS will experience feelings of depression and anxiety, at some point.  Speak to your GP if you have feelings of depression or anxiety that are affecting your daily life. These problems rarely improve without treatment and your GP can recommend treatments such as antidepressants or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which can help you cope with IBS, as well as directly treating the condition. With appropriate medical and psychological treatment, you should be able to live a normal, full and active life with IBS.  IBS does not pose a serious threat to your physical health and does not increase your chances of developing cancer or other bowel-related conditions.

Doctors sometimes refer to irritable hip as transient or toxic synovitis. Hip pain isn't usually severe, but your child may be reluctant to place weight on the affected leg. Occasionally, an irritable hip may also cause: pain in the knee or thigh restricted movement in one of the hip joints a slightly higher temperature than normal \u2013 a normal temperature is around 37C (98.6F) In younger children who are unable to speak, the only noticeable symptom may be crying at night. When to see your GP Although irritable hip is usually a mild condition, you should take your child to see your GP if you are concerned about their hips, so that a diagnosis can be confirmed. This is because irritable hip shares symptoms of more serious hip conditions, such as septic arthritis (an infection inside the hip) or Perthes disease. Your GP will examine their hip and may recommend further tests to rule out other causes. These tests include: an X-ray to see if there's a problem with your child's bones blood tests to look for a bone or joint infection an ultrasound scan that will highlight any fluid that may be on the joint If there's fluid on the joint, a sample can be removed and checked for an infection. Just removing the fluid from the joint can ease the symptoms. What causes irritable hip? The condition develops when the lining that covers the hip joint (the synovial membrane) becomes irritated and inflamed, although the cause of inflammation is unclear. Some cases of irritable hip occur following a viral infection in the chest, throat or digestive system. Many experts think the synovial membrane in the hip becomes inflamed as a complication of the infection. However, there is no hard evidence to support this theory. Another theory is that a hip injury may cause the swelling, although many cases develop in children who do not have a history of injury. Who is affected? Irritable hip can affect boys and girls of any age, but is most common between the age of four and 10 years old. The condition affects twice as many boys than girls. Is it serious? As a parent, it can be very worrying if your child is diagnosed with irritable hip and is struggling to walk. However, the condition is usually short-lived. Most cases don't require specific treatment, because the pain usually passes within two weeks. A small number of children with irritable hip go on to have further episodes. However, these episodes usually become less frequent and eventually stop when the child is older. Recovery Ibuprofen, which is available over the counter, can be used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Your child should also rest the affected leg until symptoms have passed. Massaging the affected hip and applying heat may also help to reduce your child's hip pain. It usually takes a couple of weeks to recover from irritable hip, although your GP may recommend that your child does not play sport or take part in any strenuous activities for at least another two weeks following treatment. This is to reduce the chances of irritable hip returning. Swimming is a good way to strengthen the joint and get it moving again. A follow-up appointment may be needed up to six months later. This is to rule out other hip conditions that can also cause pain, stiffness and a limp.

It means the body can\u2019t process the amino acid leucine (amino acids are 'building blocks' of protein). This causes a harmful build-up of substance in the blood and urine. Normally, our bodies break down protein foods like meat and fish into amino acids. Any amino acids that aren't needed are usually broken down and removed from the body. Babies with IVA are unable to fully break down the amino acid leucine. Normally, leucine is broken down into a substance called isovaleric acid, which is then converted into energy. Babies with IVA don\u2019t have the enzyme that breaks down isovaleric acid, leading to a harmfully high level of this substance in the body. Diagnosing IVA At around five days old, babies are now offered newborn blood spot screening to check if they have IVA. This involves pricking your baby\u2019s heel to collect drops of blood to test. If IVA is diagnosed, treatment can be given straight away to reduce the risk of serious complications. Treatment includes a special diet, advice and sometimes medication. With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, the majority of children with IVA are able to live healthy lives. However, treatment for IVA must be continued for life. Without treatment, severe and life-threatening symptoms can develop in some children, including seizures (fits) or falling into a coma. Some children with untreated IVA are also at risk of brain damage and developmental delay. Around 1 in 250,000 children are thought to be affected by IVA. Symptoms of IVA The symptoms of IVA aren't the same for everyone with the condition and some people may have more severe or frequent symptoms. Symptoms sometimes appear within the first few days or weeks after birth and may include: developing a distinctive odour of \"sweaty feet\" poor feeding or loss of appetite weight loss Babies with IVA may also have episodes known as a metabolic crisis. Symptoms of a metabolic crisis include: lack of energy vomiting irritability breathing difficulties It\u2019s important to get medical help immediately if your baby develops symptoms of a metabolic crisis. Once the condition is diagnosed, your doctor will explain how to recognise these signs. In some cases, a metabolic crisis may be triggered later in childhood by an infection or illness. The hospital should provide you with emergency treatment instructions to follow if your child is ill, which will help prevent these symptoms developing. Treating IVA Diet Children diagnosed with IVA are referred to a specialist metabolic dietitian and given a low-protein diet. This is tailored to reduce the amount of leucine your baby receives. High-protein foods need to be limited, including: meat fish cheese eggs pulses nuts Your dietitian will provide detailed advice and guidance, as your baby still needs some of these foods for healthy growth and development. Breastfeeding and baby milk also need to be monitored and measured, as advised by your dietitian. Regular baby milk contains too much leucine, so a special formula is used instead. This contains all the vitamins, minerals and other amino acids your baby needs. People with IVA need to follow a modified diet for the rest of their life to reduce their risk of a metabolic crisis. As your child gets older, they\u2019ll eventually need to learn how to control their diet and stay in contact with a dietitian for advice and monitoring. Medication Your child will be prescribed medication to help clear some of the excess isovaleric acid. This will be either: L-carnitine glycine Sometimes, both medications are prescribed to be taken together. Medication for IVA needs to be taken regularly, as directed by your doctor. Both of these are taken as tablets. Emergency treatment If your baby develops an infection, such as a high temperature or cold, their risk of having a metabolic crisis increases. It\u2019s possible to reduce the risk by changing to an emergency diet while they\u2019re ill. Your dietitian will provide detailed instructions, but the aim is to replace milk and food containing protein with special high-sugar drinks. Medication should still be taken as normal. Your dietitian may provide you with a feeding tube (nasogastric tube) and show you how to use it safely. This can be useful in an emergency if your baby isn\u2019t feeding well while they are ill. If your baby can\u2019t keep down their emergency feeds, or develops repeated diarrhoea, contact the metabolic team at the hospital to let them know you\u2019re heading straight to the accident and emergency (A&E) department. You should also have been provided with a leaflet to bring with you in case of an emergency, in case the doctors haven\u2019t seen IVA before. Once in hospital, your baby can be monitored and treated with intravenous fluids (given directly into a vein). You should also take your baby to hospital if they develop symptoms of a metabolic crisis, such as irritability, loss of energy or breathing difficulties. How IVA is inherited The genetic cause (mutation) responsible for IVA is passed on by the parents, who usually don\u2019t have any symptoms of the condition. The way this mutation is passed on is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. This means a baby needs to receive two copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition \u2013 one from their mother and one from their father. If the baby only receives one affected gene, they\u2019ll just be a carrier of IVA. If you\u2019re a carrier of the altered gene and you have a baby with a partner who\u2019s also a carrier, your baby has: a 25% chance of developing the condition a 50% chance of being a carrier of IVA a 25% chance of receiving a pair of normal genes Although it\u2019s not possible to prevent IVA, it\u2019s important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition. Any further children you have can be tested for the condition as soon as possible and given appropriate treatment. You may also wish to consider genetic counselling for support, information and advice about genetic conditions. Information about you If you or your child has IVA, your clinical team will pass information about you\/them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Itching can affect any area of the body. It can either be: generalised \u2013 where itching occurs over the whole body localised \u2013 where itching only occurs in a particular area Sometimes, there may be a rash or spot where the itching occurs. Mild, short-lived itching is common, but the problem can occasionally be severe and very frustrating to live with. Common causes of itching Itching can be caused by a number of different conditions, including: skin conditions \u2013 such as eczema allergies or skin reactions parasitic infestations \u2013 such as scabies insect bites and stings fungal infections \u2013 such as athlete\u2019s foot or vaginal thrush hormonal changes during pregnancy or the menopause systemic conditions (one that affects the whole body) \u2013 such as liver or kidney problems, or an overactive thyroid gland Read more about the possible causes of itching. Things you can do If you experience troublesome itching, there are some things you can do that may help relieve it and prevent damage caused by scratching, including: patting or tapping the itchy area, rather than scratching it holding a cold compress, such as damp flannel, over the affected area to cool it down bathing or showering in cool or lukewarm water using unperfumed personal hygiene products avoiding clothes that irritate your skin, such as wool or man-made fabrics using a moisturiser or emollient if your skin is dry or flaky There are also medicines, such as antihistamines and steroid creams, that are available over the counter from pharmacies that may help relieve itching caused by certain skin conditions. Read more about treatments to relieve itching. When to see your GP Many cases of itching will get better over a short period of time. However, you should visit your GP if your itch is: severe lasts for a long time keeps coming back associated with other symptoms \u2013 such as redness and swelling or jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) You should also visit your GP if your entire body itches and there is no obvious cause. It could be a symptom of a more serious condition. Your GP will ask you about your symptoms \u2013 for example, if you have noticed whether anything makes your itch worse, or if your itch comes and goes. They will also examine your skin to look for any visible symptoms. In some cases, they may take a skin scraping or a swab so it can be tested to help identify the cause of your itching. A blood test may also be carried out to look for underlying problems, such as thyroid or kidney disease. Depending on what is found to be causing your itch, you may be referred to a hospital specialist for a further assessment and specific treatment.  Page last reviewed: 11\/11\/2014 Next review due: 11\/11\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Causes of itchy bottom As itchy bottom is a symptom rather than a condition itself, many cases have an underlying cause, for example: a bacterial infection \u2013 such as those that cause streptococcal infections a skin condition \u2013 such as atopic eczema, where the skin becomes red, dry and flaky haemorrhoids (piles) \u2013 swellings that contain enlarged and swollen blood vessels in and around the anus In children, an itchy bottom is often caused by threadworms. But not all cases of itchy bottom have an identifiable cause. An itchy bottom can be made worse by: heat woollen clothing or blankets moisture soiling yourself stress or anxiety Read more about the causes of itchy bottom.  When to see your GP See your GP if you've had an itchy bottom for more than a few days, so they can try to find the cause. They may ask about: how often you wash and whether you use creams, powders or soaps around your anus the duration and pattern of your itching \u2013 such as whether your symptoms are worse at night or after eating certain foods other symptoms \u2013 such as bleeding or other discharge from your anus Your GP will usually want to examine the skin around your anus and may ask to carry out a digital rectal examination (DRE) to rule out more serious underlying conditions. You may feel awkward, but it's nothing to be embarrassed or worried about, as this is one of the most common examinations GPs carry out. If necessary, you may be referred to a specialist for further investigation and treatment. Treating itchy bottom An itchy bottom is usually easy to treat at home. Some ways of easing an itchy bottom include: keeping your bottom clean and dry avoid using scented soaps use soft toilet tissue avoid scratching Your GP can prescribe creams or ointments to help relieve your symptoms while the above self-care measures are taking effect. Check with your GP or pharmacist about how long you should use them for. If your itchy bottom is caused by an underlying condition, such as a bacterial infection or piles, it will also need to be treated. Read more about treating an itchy bottom. Complications of itchy bottom Frequently scratching your bottom may damage or tear the delicate skin around your anus. This may lead to problems such as: thick and leathery skin (lichenification) sore and broken down skin (ulceration) the top layer of skin being worn away (excoriation) infection The earlier these complications are diagnosed and treated, the quicker you'll recover. You should visit your GP if the skin around your anus changes or feels painful. If the cause of your itchy bottom can't be identified and treated, it may last for long periods of time (known as chronic itchy bottom). This may cause you to feel embarrassed, anxious or depressed. As the urge to scratch is often worse at night, your sleep may also be disturbed, leaving you feeling tired during the day. Speak to your GP if your itchy bottom is making you anxious or depressed, or if it's significantly affecting your sleep.

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: IUD (intrauterine device) A woman can get pregnant if a man\u2019s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping eggs being produced. One method of contraception is the intrauterine device, or IUD (sometimes called a coil). At a glance: facts about the IUD   How the IUD works   Who can use the IUD   Advantages and disadvantages of the IUD   Risks of the IUD   Where you can get an IUD An IUD is a small T-shaped plastic and copper device that\u2019s inserted into your womb (uterus) by a specially trained doctor or nurse.  The IUD works by stopping the sperm and egg from surviving in the womb or fallopian tubes. It may also prevent a fertilised egg from implanting in the womb. The IUD is a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method. This means that once it's in place, you don't have to think about it each day or each time you have sex. There are several types and sizes of IUD. You can use an IUD whether or not you've had children.   At a glance: facts about the IUD There are different types of IUD, some with more copper than others. IUDs with more copper are more than 99% effective. This means that fewer than one in 100 women who use an IUD will get pregnant in one year. IUDs with less copper will be less effective.  An IUD works as soon as it's put in, and lasts for five to 10 years, depending on the type. It can be put in at any time during your menstrual cycle, as long as you're not pregnant. It can be removed at any time by a specially trained doctor or nurse and you'll quickly return to normal levels of fertility. Changes to your periods (for example, being heavier, longer or more painful) are common in the first three to six months after an IUD is put in, but they're likely to settle down after this. You might get spotting or bleeding between periods.  There's a very small chance of infection within 20 days of the IUD being fitted.  There's a risk that your body may expel the IUD. If you get pregnant, there's an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy (when the egg implants outside the womb). But because you're unlikely to get pregnant, the overall risk of ectopic pregnancy is lower than in women who don't use contraception.  Having the IUD put in can be uncomfortable. Ask the doctor or nurse about pain relief. An IUD may not be suitable for you if you've had previous pelvic infections. The IUD does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using condoms as well as the IUD, you'll help to protect yourself against STIs. How the IUD works How it prevents pregnancy Having an IUD fitted How to tell whether an IUD is still in place Removing an IUD How it prevents pregnancy The IUD is similar to the IUS (intrauterine system) but works in a different way. Instead of releasing the hormone progestogen like the IUS, the IUD releases copper. Copper changes the make-up of the fluids in the womb and fallopian tubes, stopping sperm surviving there. IUDs may also stop fertilised eggs from implanting in the womb. There are types and sizes of IUD to suit different women. IUDs need to be fitted by a trained doctor or nurse at your GP surgery, local contraception clinic or sexual health clinic. An IUD can stay in the womb for five to 10 years, depending on the type. If you're 40 or over when you have an IUD fitted, it can be left in until you reach the menopause or until you no longer need contraception. Having an IUD fitted An IUD can be fitted at any time during your menstrual cycle, as long as you are not pregnant. You'll be protected against pregnancy straight away. Before you have an IUD fitted, you will have an internal examination to find out the size and position of your womb. This is to make sure that the IUD can be put in the correct place. You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you You may also be tested for infections, such as STIs. It's best to do this before an IUD is fitted so that you can have treatment (if you need it) before the IUD is put in. Sometimes, you may be given antibiotics at the same time as the IUD is fitted. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to insert an IUD. The vagina is held open, like it is during a cervical screening (smear) test, and the IUD is inserted through the cervix and into the womb. The fitting process can be uncomfortable and sometimes painful. You may get cramps afterwards. You can ask for a local anaesthetic or painkillers before having the IUD fitted. An anaesthetic injection itself can be painful, so many women have the procedure without. You may get pain and bleeding for a few days after having an IUD fitted. Discuss this with your GP or nurse beforehand.   The IUD needs to be checked by a doctor after three to six weeks. Speak to your doctor or nurse if you have any problems before or after this first check or if you want the IUD removed. Speak to your doctor or nurse if you or your partner are at risk of getting an STI. This is because STIs can lead to an infection in the pelvis. See your GP or go back to the clinic where your IUD was fitted as soon as you can if you: have pain in your lower abdomen have a high temperature have a smelly discharge These may mean you have an infection. How to tell whether an IUD is still in place An IUD has two thin threads that hang down a little way from your womb into the top of your vagina. The doctor or nurse who fits your IUD will teach you how to feel for these threads and check that it is still in place. Check your IUD is in place a few times in the first month, and then after each period or at regular intervals.  It's very unlikely that your IUD will come out, but if you can't feel the threads, or if you think the IUD has moved, you may not be fully protected against getting pregnant. See your doctor or nurse straight away and use an extra method of contraception, such as condoms, until your IUD has been checked. If you've had sex recently, you may need to use emergency contraception. Your partner shouldn't be able to feel your IUD during sex. If he can feel the threads, get your doctor or nurse to check that your IUD is in place. They may be able to cut the threads to a shorter length. If you feel any pain during sex, go for a check-up. Removing an IUD An IUD can be removed at any time by a trained doctor or nurse. If you're not going to have another IUD put in and you don't want to get pregnant, use another method (such as condoms) for seven days before you have the IUD removed. This is to stop sperm getting into your body. Sperm can live for up to seven days in the body and could make you pregnant once the IUD is removed. As soon as an IUD is taken out, your normal fertility should return.  Who can use an IUD Most women can use an IUD. This includes women who have never been pregnant and those who are HIV positive. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your medical history to check if an IUD is the most suitable form of contraception for you. You should not use an IUD if you have: an untreated STI or a pelvic infection  problems with your womb or cervix  any unexplained bleeding from your vagina \u2013 for example, between periods or after sex Women who have had an ectopic pregnancy or recent abortion, or who have an artificial heart valve, must consult their GP or clinician before having an IUD fitted. You should not be fitted with an IUD if there's a chance that you are already pregnant or if you or your partner are at risk of catching STIs. If you or your partner are unsure, go to your GP or a sexual health clinic to be tested. Using an IUD after giving birth An IUD can usually be fitted four to six weeks after giving birth (vaginal or caesarean). You'll need to use alternative contraception from three weeks (21 days) after the birth until the IUD is fitted. In some cases, an IUD can be fitted within 48 hours of giving birth. An IUD is safe to use when you're breastfeeding and it won't affect your milk supply. Using an IUD after a miscarriage or abortion An IUD can be fitted straight away or within 48 hours after an abortion or miscarriage by an experienced doctor or nurse, as long as you were pregnant for less than 24 weeks. If you were pregnant for more than 24 weeks, you may have to wait a few weeks before having an IUD fitted.  Advantages and disadvantages of the IUD Although an IUD is an effective method of contraception, there are some things to consider before having one fitted. Advantages of the IUD Most women can use an IUD, including women who have never been pregnant. Once an IUD is fitted, it works straight away and lasts for up to 10 years or until it's removed. It doesn't interrupt sex. It can be used if you're breastfeeding. Your normal fertility returns as soon as the IUD is taken out It's not affected by other medicines. There's no evidence that having an IUD fitted will increase the risk of cancer of the cervix, endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the womb) or ovarian cancer. Some women experience changes in mood and libido, but these changes are very small. There is no evidence that the IUD affects weight. Disadvantages of the IUD Your periods may become heavier, longer or more painful, though this may improve after a few months.  An IUD doesn't protect against STIs, so you may have to use condoms as well. If you get an STI while you have an IUD, it could lead to a pelvic infection if not treated. The most common reasons that women stop using an IUD are vaginal bleeding and pain. Risks of the IUD Complications after having an IUD fitted are rare. Most will appear within the first year after fitting. Damage to the womb In fewer than one in 1,000 cases, an IUD can perforate (make a hole in) the womb or neck of the womb (cervix) when it's put in. This can cause pain in the lower abdomen, but doesn't usually cause any other symptoms. If the doctor or nurse fitting your IUD is experienced, the risk of this is very low. If perforation occurs, you may need surgery to remove the IUD. Contact your GP straight away if you feel a lot of pain after having an IUD fitted as perforations should be treated immediately. Pelvic infections Pelvic infections can occur in the first 20 days after the IUD is fitted. The risk of infection is very small. Fewer than one in 100 women who are at low risk of STIs will get a pelvic infection. Rejection Occasionally, the IUD is rejected (expelled) by the womb or can move (this is called displacement). This is more likely to happen soon after it has been fitted, although this is uncommon. Your doctor or nurse will teach you how to check that your IUD is in place. Ectopic pregnancy If the IUD fails and you become pregnant, your IUD should be removed as soon as possible if you're going to continue with the pregnancy. There's a small increased risk of ectopic pregnancy if a woman becomes pregnant while using an IUD. Where to get an IUD Most types of contraception are available free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics sexual health clinics \u2013 these offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people\u2019s services (call the sexual health line on 0300 123 7123 for details) Find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching your postcode or town. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacists won't tell your parents or carer, as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.   Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 12\/01\/2015 Next review due: 12\/01\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: IUS (intrauterine system) A woman can get pregnant if a man\u2019s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the IUS, or intrauterine system (sometimes called the hormonal coil). At a glance: facts about the IUS   How the IUS works   Who can use the IUS   Advantages and disadvantages of the IUS   Risks of the IUS   Where to get the IUS An IUS is a small, T-shaped plastic device that is inserted into your womb (uterus) by a specially trained doctor or nurse. The IUS releases a progestogen hormone into the womb. This thickens the mucus from your cervix, making it difficult for sperm to move through and reach an egg. It also thins the womb lining so that it's less likely to accept a fertilised egg. It may also stop ovulation (the release of an egg) in some women. The IUS is a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method. It works for five years or three years, depending on the type, so you don't have to think about contraception every day or each time you have sex. Two brands of IUS are used in the UK \u2013 Mirena and Jaydess.  You can use an IUS whether or not you've had children. At a glance: facts about the IUS   It's more than 99% effective. Less than one in every 100 women who use Mirena will get pregnant in five years, and less than one in 100 who use Jaydess will get pregnant in three years. It can be taken out at any time by a specially trained doctor or nurse and your fertility quickly returns to normal. The IUS can make your periods lighter, shorter or stop altogether, so it may help women who have heavy periods or painful periods. Jaydess is less likely than Mirena to make your periods stop altogether. It can be used by women who can't use combined contraception (such as the combined pill) \u2013 for example, those who have migraines. Once the IUS is in place, you don't have to think about contraception every day or each time you have sex. Some women may experience mood swings, skin problems or breast tenderness.   There's a small risk of getting an infection after it's inserted. It can be uncomfortable when the IUS is put in, although painkillers can help with this. The IUS can be fitted at any time during your monthly menstrual cycle, as long as you're definitely not pregnant. Ideally, it should be fitted within seven days of the start of your period, because this will protect against pregnancy straight away. You should use condoms for seven days if the IUS is fitted at any other time. The IUS does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using condoms as well as the IUS, you'll help to protect yourself against STIs.   How the IUS works How it prevents pregnancy  Having an IUS fitted How to tell whether an IUS is still in place Removing an IUS How it prevents pregnancy The IUS is similar to the IUD (intrauterine device), but works in a slightly different way. Rather than releasing copper like the IUD, the IUS releases a progestogen hormone, which is similar to the natural hormone progesterone that's produced in a woman's ovaries. Progestogen thickens the mucus from the cervix (opening of the womb), making it harder for sperm to move through it and reach an egg. It also causes the womb lining to become thinner and less likely to accept a fertilised egg. In some women, the IUS also stops the ovaries from releasing an egg (ovulation), but most women will continue to ovulate. If you're 45 or older when you have the IUS fitted, it can be left until you reach menopause or you no longer need contraception. Having an IUS fitted You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you An IUS can be fitted at any stage of your menstrual cycle, as long as you are not pregnant. If it's fitted in the first seven days of your cycle, you will be protected against pregnancy straight away. If it's fitted at any other time, you need to use another method of contraception (such as condoms) for seven days after it's fitted. Before you have an IUS fitted, you will have an internal examination to determine the size and position of your womb. This is to make sure that the IUS can be positioned in the correct place. You may also be tested for any existing infections, such as STIs. It is best to do this before an IUS is fitted so that any infections can be treated. You may be given antibiotics at the same time as an IUS is fitted. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to insert an IUS: the vagina is held open, like it is during a cervical screening (smear) test the IUS is inserted through the cervix and into the womb The fitting process can be uncomfortable or painful for some women, and you may also experience cramps afterwards. You can ask for a local anaesthetic or painkillers before having the IUS fitted. Discuss this with your GP or nurse beforehand. An anaesthetic injection itself can be painful, so many women have the procedure without one. Once an IUS is fitted, it will need to be checked by a doctor after three to six weeks to make sure everything is fine. Speak to your GP or clinician if you have any problems after this initial check or if you want the IUS removed. Also speak to your GP if you or your partner are at risk of getting an STI, as this can lead to infection in the pelvis. See your GP or go back to the clinic if you: have pain in your lower abdomen have a high temperature have smelly discharge This may mean you have an infection. How to tell if an IUS is still in place An IUS has two thin threads that hang down a little way from your womb into the top of your vagina. The GP or clinician that fits your IUS will teach you how to feel for these threads and check that the IUS is still in place. Check your IUS is in place a few times in the first month and then after each period at regular intervals. It is highly unlikely that your IUS will come out, but if you can't feel the threads or if you think the IUS has moved, you may not be fully protected against pregnancy. See your doctor or nurse straight away and use extra contraception, such as condoms, until your IUS has been checked. If you've had sex recently, you may need to use emergency contraception. Your partner shouldn't be able to feel your IUS during sex. If he can feel the threads, get your GP or clinician to check that your IUS is in place. They may be able to cut the threads a little. If you feel any pain during sex, go for a check-up with your GP or clinician. Removing an IUS Your IUS can be removed at any time by a trained doctor or nurse. If you're not going to have another IUS put in and you don't want to become pregnant, use another contraceptive method (such as condoms) for seven days before you have the IUS removed. Sperm can live for seven days in the body and could fertilise an egg once the IUS is removed. As soon as an IUS is taken out, your normal fertility should return. Who can use an IUS Most women can use an IUS, including women who have never been pregnant and those who are HIV positive. Your GP or clinician will ask about your medical history to check if an IUS is the most suitable form of contraception for you. Your family and medical history will determine whether or not you can use an IUS. For example, this method of contraception may not be suitable for you if you have: breast cancer, or have had it in the past five years cervical cancer  liver disease unexplained vaginal bleeding between periods or after sex arterial disease or history of serious heart disease or stroke an untreated STI or pelvic infection problems with your womb or cervix An IUS may not be suitable for women who have untreated STIs. A doctor will usually give you a check-up to make sure you don't have any existing infections. Using an IUS after giving birth An IUS can usually be fitted four to six weeks after giving birth (vaginal or caesarean). You'll need to use alternative contraception from three weeks (21 days) after the birth until the IUS is put in. In some cases, an IUS can be fitted within 48 hours of giving birth. It is safe to use an IUS when you're breastfeeding, and it won't affect your milk supply. Using an IUS after a miscarriage or abortion An IUS can be fitted by an experienced doctor or nurse straight after an abortion or miscarriage, as long as you were pregnant for less than 24 weeks. If you were pregnant for more than 24 weeks, you may have to wait a few weeks before an IUS can be fitted. Advantages and disadvantages of the IUS Although an IUS is an effective method of contraception, there are several things to consider before having an IUS fitted. Advantages of the IUS It works for five years (Mirena) or three years (Jaydess).  It's one of the most effective forms of contraception available in the UK. It doesn't interrupt sex. An IUS may be useful if you have heavy or painful periods because your periods usually become much lighter and shorter, and sometimes less painful \u2013 they may stop completely after the first year of use. It can be used safely if you're breastfeeding.  It's not affected by other medicines. It may be a good option if you can't take the hormone oestrogen, which is used in the combined contraceptive pill.  Your fertility will return to normal when the IUS is removed. There's no evidence that an IUS will affect your weight or that having an IUS fitted will increase the risk of cervical cancer, cancer of the uterus or ovarian cancer. Some women experience changes in mood and libido, but these changes are very small. Disadvantages of the IUS Some women won't be happy with the way that their periods may change. For example, periods may become lighter and more irregular or, in some cases, stop completely. Your periods are more likely to stop completely with Mirena than with Jaydess. Irregular bleeding and spotting are common in the first six months after having an IUS fitted. This is not harmful and usually decreases with time. Some women experience headaches, acne and breast tenderness after having the IUS fitted. An uncommon side effect of the IUS is the appearance of small fluid-filled cysts on the ovaries \u2013 these usually disappear without treatment. An IUS doesn't protect you against STIs, so you may also have to use condoms when having sex. If you get an STI while you have an IUS fitted, it could lead to pelvic infection if it's not treated. Most women who stop using an IUS do so because of vaginal bleeding and pain, although this is uncommon. Hormonal problems can also occur, but these are even less common. Risks of the IUS Complications caused by an IUS are rare and usually happen in the first six months after it has been fitted. These include: Damage to the womb In rare cases (fewer than one in 1,000 insertions) an IUS can perforate (make a hole in) the womb or neck of the womb (cervix) when it is put in. This can cause pain in the lower abdomen, but doesn't usually cause any other symptoms. If the doctor or nurse fitting your IUS is experienced, the risk of perforation is extremely low. If perforation occurs, you may need surgery to remove the IUS. Contact your GP straight away if you feel a lot of pain after having an IUS fitted. Perforations should be treated immediately. Pelvic infections Pelvic infections may occur in the first 20 days after the IUS has been inserted. The risk of infection from an IUS is extremely small (fewer than one in 100 women who are at low risk of STIs will get an infection). A GP or clinician will usually recommend an internal examination before fitting an IUS to be sure that there are no existing infections. Rejection Occasionally, the IUS is rejected (expelled) by the womb or it can move (this is called displacement). This is not common and is more likely to happen soon after it has been fitted. Your doctor or nurse will teach you how to check that your IUS is in place. Ectopic pregnancy If the IUS fails and you become pregnant, your IUS should be removed as soon as possible if you are continuing with the pregnancy. There's a small increased risk of ectopic pregnancy if a woman becomes pregnant while using an IUS. Where to get the IUS Most types of contraception are available for free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics sexual health clinics \u2013 they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people\u2019s services (call 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find sexual health services near you, including contraception clinics. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won't tell your parents or carer as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.

During IVF, an egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilised egg, called an embryo, is then returned to the woman's womb to grow and develop. It can be carried out using your eggs and your partner's sperm, or eggs and\/or sperm from donors. Who can have IVF? The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published fertility guidelines that make recommendations about who should have access to IVF treatment on the NHS in England and Wales. These guidelines recommended that IVF should be offered to women under 43 years of age who have been trying to get pregnant through regular unprotected sex for two years, or who have had 12 cycles of artificial insemination. However, the final decision about who can have NHS-funded IVF in England is made by local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), and their criteria may be stricter than those recommended by NICE. If you're not eligible for NHS treatment, or you decide to pay for IVF, you can have treatment at a private clinic. Costs vary, but one cycle of treatment may cost up to £5,000 or more. Read more about the availability of IVF. Speaking to your GP about IVF If you're having trouble getting pregnant, you should start by speaking to your GP. They can advise on how to improve your chances of having a baby.  If these measures don't work, your GP can refer you to a fertility specialist for a treatment such as IVF. Read more about getting started with IVF. What happens during IVF IVF involves six main stages: Suppressing your natural cycle \u2013 the menstrual cycle is suppressed with medication Boosting your egg supply \u2013 medication is used to encourage the ovaries to produce more eggs than usual Monitoring your progress and maturing your eggs \u2013 an ultrasound scan is carried out to check the development of the eggs, and medication is used to help them mature Collecting the eggs \u2013 a needle is inserted into the ovaries, via the vagina, to remove the eggs Fertilising the eggs \u2013 the eggs are mixed with the sperm for a few days to allow them to be fertilised Transferring the embryo(s) \u2013 one or two fertilised eggs (embryos) are placed into the womb Once the embryo(s) has been transferred into your womb, you'll need to wait two weeks before having a pregnancy test, to see if the treatment has worked. Read more about what happens during IVF. Chances of success The success rate of IVF depends on the age of the woman undergoing treatment, as well as the cause of the infertility (if it's known). Younger women are more likely to have a successful pregnancy. IVF isn't usually recommended for women above the age of 42, because the chances of a successful pregnancy are thought to be too low. In 2010, the percentage of IVF treatments that resulted in a live birth was: 32.2% for women under 35   27.7% for women aged 35-37   20.8% for women aged 38-39    13.6% for women aged 40-42    5% for women aged 43-44  1.9% for women aged over 44 Maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding alcohol, smoking and caffeine during treatment may improve your chances of having a baby with IVF. What are the risks? IVF doesn't always result in pregnancy, and it can be both physically and emotionally demanding. You should be offered counselling to help you through the process. There are also a number of health risks involved, including: side effects from the medications used during treatment, such as hot flushes and headaches multiple births (such as twins or triplets) \u2013 this can be dangerous for both the mother and the children an ectopic pregnancy \u2013 where the embryo implants in the fallopian tubes, rather than in the womb ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) \u2013 where too many eggs develop in the ovaries Read more about support available during and after IVF and the risks of IVF.
