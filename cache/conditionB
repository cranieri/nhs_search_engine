Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body using a substance called haemoglobin. Anaemia is the general term for having either fewer red blood cells than normal or having an abnormally low amount of haemoglobin in each red blood cell. There are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. For example, iron deficiency anaemia, which occurs when the body doesn't contain enough iron. Symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency Vitamin B12 and folate perform several important functions in the body, including keeping the nervous system healthy. A deficiency in either of these vitamins can cause a wide range of problems, including: extreme tiredness a lack of energy pins and needles (paraesthesia) a sore and red tongue mouth ulcers muscle weakness disturbed vision psychological problems, which may include depression and confusion  problems with memory, understanding and judgement Some of these problems can also occur if you have a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate, but don't have anaemia. Read about the symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia. When to see your GP See your GP if you think you may have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These conditions can often be diagnosed based on your symptoms and the results of a blood test. It's important for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible because, although many of the symptoms improve with treatment, some problems caused by the condition can be irreversible. Read about diagnosing vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia. Causes of a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency There are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, including: pernicious anaemia \u2013 where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach, preventing your body from absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK a lack of these vitamins in your diet \u2013 this is uncommon, but can occur if you have a vegan diet, follow a fad diet or have a generally poor diet for a long time medication \u2013 certain medications, including anticonvulsants and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can affect how much of these vitamins your body absorbs  Both vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency are more common in older people, affecting around 1 in 10 people aged 75 or over, and 1 in 20 people aged 65 to 74. Read about the causes of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia. Treating vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Most cases of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency can be easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the missing vitamins. Vitamin B12 supplements are usually given by injection at first. Then, depending on whether your B12 deficiency is related to your diet, you'll either require B12 tablets between meals or regular injections. These treatments may be needed for the rest of your life. Folic acid tablets are used to restore folate levels. These usually need to be taken for four months. In some cases, improving your diet can help treat the condition and prevent it recurring. Vitamin B12 is found in meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, yeast extract (such as Marmite) and specially fortified foods. The best sources of folate include green vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts and peas. Read about treating vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Complications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Although it's uncommon, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency (with or without anaemia) can lead to complications, particularly if you've been deficient in vitamin B12 or folate for some time. Potential complications can include: problems with the nervous system temporary infertility heart conditions pregnancy complications and birth defects Adults with severe anaemia are also at risk of developing heart failure. Some complications improve with appropriate treatment, but others \u2013 such as problems with the nervous system \u2013 can be permanent.  Read about the complications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia.

Crying is your baby's way of telling you they need comfort and care. Sometimes it's easy to work out what they want, and sometimes it isn't. The most common reasons for crying are: hunger a dirty or wet nappy tiredness wanting a cuddle wind being too hot or too cold boredom overstimulation There may be times of the day when your baby tends to cry a lot and can't be comforted. Early evening is the most common time for this to happen. This can be hard for you, as it's often the time when you're most tired and least able to cope. The amount babies cry tends to peak at about seven weeks, then gradually tail off. How to calm a crying baby Crying during feeds If your baby cries constantly Getting help with a crying baby Never shake your baby How to calm a crying baby Try some of the following ways to comfort your baby. Some may work better than others: If you're breastfeeding, let your baby suckle at your breast. If you're bottle feeding, give your baby a dummy. Sterilise dummies as you would bottles. To avoid tooth decay, don't dip them in anything sweet. Some babies use their thumb instead. Some older babies like to use a bit of cloth or a blanket as a comforter. Hold your baby or put them in a sling so they're close to you. Move about gently, sway and dance, talk to them and sing. Rock your baby backwards and forwards in the pram, or go out for a walk or a drive. Lots of babies like to sleep in cars. Even if they wake up again when you stop, at least you'll have had a break. Find something for them to listen to or look at. This could be music on the radio, a CD, a rattle, or a mobile above the cot. Try stroking your baby's back firmly and rhythmically, holding them against you or lying face downwards on your lap. Undress your baby and massage them gently and firmly. Avoid using any oils or lotions until your baby is at least a month old. Talk soothingly as you do it and keep the room warm enough. Some health centres and clinics run baby massage courses. For information, ask your midwife or health visitor. Try a warm bath. This calms some babies instantly, but makes others cry even more. Sometimes too much rocking and singing can keep your baby awake. You might find lying them down after a feed will help. Ask your health visitor for advice. Crying during feeds Some babies cry and seem unsettled around the time of a feed. If you're breastfeeding, you may find that improving your baby's positioning and attachment helps them settle. You can go to a breastfeeding drop-in and ask for help, or talk to your health visitor. It may be that something you're eating or drinking is affecting your baby. If you think this is happening, try keeping a diary of what you eat and when the crying happens. If you see any patterns, talk to your health visitor. Crying during feeds can sometimes be a symptom of reflux, a common condition where babies bring back milk after feeds. Speak to your health visitor or GP for more information and advice. If your baby cries constantly There are several reasons that can cause a baby to cry excessively. It can be exhausting if you've tried everything and nothing seems to comfort your baby. Colic Excessive crying could be a sign that your baby has colic. Everyone agrees that colic exists, but nobody knows what causes it. Some doctors think it's a kind of stomach cramp. The crying sounds miserable and distressed, and stops for a moment or two, then starts up again, which suggests it could be caused by waves of stomach pain. The crying can go on for some hours. There may be little you can do except try to comfort your baby and wait for the crying to pass. See some tips for coping with colic. Crying and illness If your baby is crying constantly and you can't console or distract them, or the cry doesn't sound like their normal cry, it can be a sign they are ill. Or they may be ill if they are crying and have other symptoms, such as a high temperature. If this is the case, contact your health visitor or GP. Get medical attention as soon as you can if your baby:   has much drier nappies than usual has a high temperature, but their hands and feet feel cold has a fit (seizure or convulsion) has blue, mottled, ashen (grey) or very pale skin breathes rapidly or makes a throaty noise while breathing, or seems to be working hard to breathe, perhaps sucking in their stomach under their ribcage has a spotty purple-red rash anywhere on the body \u2013 this could be a sign of meningitis See more signs of serious illness. If you think there's something wrong, always follow your instincts. During the day, Monday to Friday, contact your GP surgery. At evenings and weekends you can call NHS 111 or your GP's out-of-hours number. Getting help with a crying baby You can talk to a friend, your health visitor or GP, or contact the Cry-sis helpline on 08451 228 669, open 9am to 10pm, 7 days a week. You will be charged for your call.  Cry-sis can put you in touch with other parents who have been in the same situation. You can also visit the Cry-sis website for information on coping with crying babies.   If you decide to talk to your health visitor or GP, it can help to keep a record of how often and when your baby cries. For example, this might be after every feed or during the evening. This can help your health visitor or GP to work out if there is a particular cause for the crying. Keeping a record can also help you identify the times when you need extra support. You could think about possible changes to your routine. There may be times when you're so tired and angry you feel like you can't take any more. This happens to a lot of parents, so don't be ashamed to ask for help. If you don't have anyone who can take care of your baby for a short time and the crying is making you stressed, put your baby in their cot or pram, make sure they're safe, close the door, go into another room and try to calm yourself down. Set a time limit \u2013 for example, 10 minutes \u2013 then go back. Never shake your baby No matter how frustrated you feel, you must never shake your baby.

Most rashes are harmless and go away on their own. But if your baby has developed a rash and seems unwell, or if you're worried, see your GP to find out the cause and receive any necessary treatment. It's especially important to be aware of the symptoms of meningitis. This guide may give you a better idea of the cause of the rash, but don't use it to diagnose your baby's condition. Always see a GP for a proper diagnosis. This page covers the following common rashes in babies: Baby acne (neonatal acne)  Cradle cap  Eczema  Erythema toxicum (the \"normal newborn rash\")  Hand, foot and mouth disease  Sweat rash (miliaria)  Hives (urticaria)  Impetigo  Milia (blocked oil glands)  Nappy rash  Ringworm  Scabies  Slapped cheek syndrome  It also describes the warning signs of meningitis and explains what to do if you're worried about your baby. The causes of rashes in older children are covered separately. Baby acne (neonatal acne) Pimples sometimes develop on a baby's cheeks, nose and forehead within a month of their birth. These tend to get worse before clearing up completely after a few weeks or months. Washing your baby's face with water and a mild moisturiser can improve the appearance of their skin. Avoid acne medicines intended for older children and adults. Pimples or blackheads that develop after three months of age (infantile acne) tend to be more severe and often need medical treatment. Cradle cap Cradle cap is where yellowish, greasy, scaly patches develop on a baby's scalp. Occasionally, the face, ears and neck are also affected. Cradle cap isn't itchy and shouldn't bother your baby. If your baby is scratching or upset, they may have eczema (see below). Cradle cap is a common condition that tends to develop within two or three months after birth. It usually gets better without treatment in a few weeks or months. Gently washing your baby's hair and scalp with baby shampoo may help to prevent further patches developing. Read more about treating cradle cap. Eczema Eczema is a long-term condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. The most common form is atopic eczema, which mainly affects babies and children but can continue into adulthood. Eczema in babies under six months is sometimes associated with allergies to milk and egg. Atopic eczema often starts in young babies as a red, itchy rash on the face, scalp and body. As the child gets older, it usually starts to develop in areas with folds of skin, such as behind the knees or on the front of the elbows. Creams and ointments can often relieve the symptoms. Read more about managing your baby's eczema. Erythema toxicum Half of all newborns develop a blotchy red skin reaction called erythema toxicum, usually at two or three days old. It's a normal newborn rash that won't bother your baby and clears after a few days. Hand, foot and mouth disease Hand, foot and mouth disease is a common, viral illness that causes a blistery rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, as well as ulcers in the mouth. Your baby may also feel unwell and have a fever. Treatment isn't usually needed, as the baby's immune system clears the virus, and symptoms go away after about 7 to 10 days. If you're worried, see your GP. Hives (urticaria) Hives (also known as urticaria) is a raised, red itchy rash that appears on the skin. It happens when a trigger (such as a food that your baby is allergic to) causes a substance called histamine to be released into their skin. If your baby gets urticaria during feeding, the condition may be triggered by something they've had to eat or drink. The most common foods are egg and milk, but many other foods can sometimes be the cause. The urticaria rash is usually short-lived and can be controlled with antihistamines. Read more about treating hives. If your baby gets hives repeatedly, it's important to see your GP to discuss possible allergies. Impetigo Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the surface layers of the skin, which causes sores and blisters. It's not usually serious, but you can visit your GP for a prescription of antibiotics, which should clear the infection within 7 to 10 days. Read more about treating impetigo. Milia  About half of all newborns develop tiny (1-2mm) white spots, called milia, on their face. These are just blocked pores and usually clear within the first four weeks of life. Nappy rash Nappy rash occurs when the skin around the baby's nappy area becomes irritated. This is often caused by prolonged exposure to wee or poo, but can sometimes be the result of a fungal infection or rare skin condition. You can usually reduce nappy rash by taking simple steps to keep your baby's skin clean and dry, and using a barrier cream if needed. Antifungal cream may be necessary if the rash is caused by a fungal infection. Read more about nappies and nappy rash. Ringworm Ringworm is a common fungal skin infection that causes a ring-like red rash almost anywhere on the body (the baby's scalp, feet and groin are common areas). It's usually easily treated using over-the-counter creams. Read more about treating ringworm. Scabies Scabies is a common infestation of the skin that can affect people of all ages. It's caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin. It's often spread between family members, so when babies get scabies it's usually because someone else in the family had it recently. Babies with scabies develop tiny and very itchy spots all over the body, including on the soles of the feet, armpits and genital area. Treatment with creams that kill the scabies mite needs to be given to the whole family at the same time for it to be effective. Slapped cheek syndrome Slapped cheek syndrome is a viral infection particularly common in children and babies. It typically causes a bright red rash on both cheeks and a fever. Most babies won't need treatment, as slapped cheek syndrome is usually a mild condition that passes in a few days. Sweat rash (miliaria) A heat rash, sometimes called miliaria or prickly heat, may flare up when your baby sweats \u2013 for example, because they're dressed in too many clothes or the environment is hot and humid. It's a sign your baby's sweat glands have become blocked. They may develop tiny red bumps or blisters on their skin, but these will soon clear without treatment. Meningitis warning signs It's important to be aware of the warning signs of meningitis in your baby, which include: becoming floppy and unresponsive, or stiff with jerky movements becoming irritable and not wanting to be held unusual crying vomiting and refusing feeds pale and blotchy skin loss of appetite staring expression very sleepy with a reluctance to wake up fever  Some babies develop a swelling in the soft part of their head (fontanelle). Trust your instincts. If you think your baby has meningitis, see your GP immediately or go to your nearest accident & emergency (A&E) department.  Page last reviewed: 02\/07\/2015 Next review due: 02\/07\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

When should I introduce my baby to solid foods? Media last reviewed: 28\/01\/2015 Next review due: 28\/01\/2017 When to start introducing solid foods Introducing your baby to solid foods \u2013 sometimes called weaning or complementary feeding \u2013 should start when your baby is around six months old. It's a really important step in their development, and it can be great fun to explore new flavours and textures together. To begin with, how much your baby takes is less important than getting them used to the idea of eating. They will still be getting most of their nutrition from breast milk or infant formula.  Babies don't need three meals a day to start with, so you can begin by offering foods at a time that suits you both. Gradually, you'll be able to increase the amount and variety of food your baby eats, until they can eventually eat the same as the rest of the family, in smaller portions. Why it pays to wait until they're ready Research shows babies can get all the nutrients they need from breast milk or infant formula until they are around six months old. Waiting till then gives their digestive system time to develop fully so it can cope with solid foods. This includes solid foods made into purées and cereals added to milk. If you are breastfeeding, having breast milk alone up to the age of six months will protect your baby against infections. Breast milk will carry on protecting them from infections for as long as you carry on feeding. Whether your baby has breast milk or infant formula, waiting until they are ready for food will save a lot of time, too. They'll quickly be able to feed themselves and with less mess, as they will be able to swallow properly. Three signs your baby is ready for their first food Every baby is an individual, but there are three clear signs that, together, show your baby is ready for solid foods alongside breast milk or formula. It's very rare for these signs to appear together before your baby is six months old. 1. They can stay in a sitting position and hold their head steady. 2. They can co-ordinate their eyes, hands and mouth so they can look at the food, pick it up and put it in their mouth, all by themselves. 3. They can swallow food. Babies who are not ready will push their food back out with their tongue, so they get more round their face than they do in their mouths. Some signs that can be mistaken for a baby being ready for solid foods: chewing fists waking in the night when they have previously slept through wanting extra milk feeds These are normal behaviours and not necessarily a sign of hunger or being ready to start solid food. Starting solid foods won't make them any more likely to sleep through the night. Extra feeds are usually enough until they're ready for other food. Getting started with solid foods Always stay with your baby when they are eating in case they start to choke. Find out how to help a choking child. Let your baby enjoy touching and holding the food. Allow your baby to feed themselves, using their fingers, as soon as they show an interest. Don't force your baby to eat \u2013 wait until the next time if they're not interested this time. If you're using a spoon, wait for your baby to open their mouth before you offer the food. Your baby may like to hold a spoon, too. Start by offering just a few pieces or teaspoons of food, once a day. Cool hot food and test it before giving it to your baby. Don't add salt, sugar or stock cubes to your baby's food or cooking water. See what other foods to avoid giving your baby. What foods to give your baby as they grow Feeding your baby from 0-6 months Your baby only needs breast milk or first infant formula. \"Follow-on\" formula isn't suitable for babies under six months, and you don't need to introduce it after six months either. Check with your health visitor or GP first if you want to introduce solid foods before six months. Babies and food allergies While variety in your baby's diet is really important, there is a chance they may be allergic to certain foods. That's why it's important to introduce cows' milk, eggs, wheat, gluten, nuts, peanuts, peanut products, seeds, fish and shellfish one at a time and not before six months. There is no evidence that waiting until your child is older will prevent them developing a food allergy. Once your baby is ready for solids, give them these foods in very small amounts and watch carefully for any symptoms of an allergic reaction. If your baby already has a known allergy, such as a diagnosed food allergy or eczema, or you have a family history of food allergies, eczema, asthma or hay fever, you may need to be particularly careful when introducing peanuts and peanut products. Talk to your GP or health visitor first. Remember, peanuts, like all nuts, should be crushed or ground. See more about food allergies in babies and toddlers. Baby food from 6 months First foods Your baby's first foods can include mashed or soft cooked fruit and vegetables like parsnip, potato, yam, sweet potato, carrot, apple or pear, all cooled before eating. Soft fruits like peach or melon, or baby rice or baby cereal mixed with your baby's usual milk, are good as well. Keep feeding your baby breast milk or infant formula, too, but don't give them whole cows' milk as a drink until they are one year old. Finger foods Finger food is food that is cut up into pieces big enough for your baby to hold in their fist with a bit sticking out. Pieces about the size of your own finger work well. Your baby learns to chew this way. Try grabbable bits of soft, ripe banana or avocado. Next foods  Once your baby is used to the foods above, they can have soft cooked meat such as chicken, mashed fish (check very carefully for any bones), pasta, noodles, toast, pieces of chapatti, lentils, rice and mashed hard-boiled eggs. They can also have full-fat dairy products such as yoghurt, fromage frais or custard. Choose products with no added sugar or less sugar. Whole cows' milk can be used in cooking or mixed with food from six months. Cups Introduce a cup from around six months and offer sips of water with meals. Using an open cup or a free-flow cup without a valve will help your baby learn to sip and is better for their teeth. See more about cups for babies and toddlers. Vitamins The Department of Health recommends that all under-fives are given vitamin supplements containing vitamins A, C and D every day.  Babies who are having more than 500ml (about a pint) of infant formula a day shouldn't be given vitamin supplements because formula is already fortified with nutrients. Read more about vitamins for babies and toddlers. Feeding your baby from 8-9 months Your baby will gradually move towards eating three meals a day. It will be a mixture of soft finger foods, and mashed or chopped foods. Your baby's diet should consist of a variety of the following: fruit and vegetables; bread, rice, pasta, potatoes and other starchy foods; meat, fish, eggs, beans and other non-dairy sources of protein; and milk and dairy products. See advice on portion size (PDF, 3.6Mb) from First Steps Nutrition. Your baby's food from 12 months Your baby will now be eating three meals a day, chopped if necessary, plus breast milk or whole cows' milk and healthier snacks like fruit, vegetable sticks, toast and rice cakes. They can now drink whole cows' milk. Choose full-fat dairy products as children under two need the extra fat and vitamins found in them. From two years old, if they are a good eater and growing well, they can have semi-skimmed milk. From five years old, 1% fat and skimmed milk is OK. You can give your baby: three to four servings a day of starchy food such as potatoes, bread and rice three to four servings a day of fruit and vegetables two servings a day of meat, fish, eggs, dhal or other pulses (beans and lentils) Read more about what to feed young children. What milk, when? For around the first six months you should feed your baby only breast milk or infant formula. Infant formula made from cows' or goats' milk is the only suitable alternative to breast milk in the first 12 months of your baby's life. Only use soya-based infant formula if your GP has advised you to. Follow-on milks are available for babies over six months, but there is no need to change over to these. Cows' milk can be mixed with food from six months and whole cows' milk can be given as a drink from one year. Semi-skimmed milk can be introduced once your child is two years old, as long as they're a good eater and they have a varied diet. Skimmed and 1% milk aren't suitable for children under five, as they don't contain enough calories. Infant formula, follow-on formula or growing-up milks are not needed once your baby is 12 months old. Goats' and sheep's milk are not suitable as a drink for babies under one year. You can give your child unsweetened calcium-fortified milk alternatives, such as soya, almond and oat drinks, as part of a healthy, balanced diet from the age of one. Toddlers and young children under the age of five should not be given rice drinks because of the levels of arsenic they contain. If your child has an allergy or intolerance to milk, talk to your health visitor or GP. They can advise you on suitable milk alternatives. See more about drinks for babies and toddlers.

What do I need to buy or borrow for my newborn? Media last reviewed: 20\/03\/2014 Next review due: 20\/03\/2017 Baby clothes Baby bedding Out and about with your baby Baby clothes Babies grow very quickly. All you need for the first few weeks are enough clothes to make sure your baby will be warm and clean. You'll probably need: six stretch suits (all-in-ones) for both day and night, or four stretch suits and two nightdresses (nighties) for the night \u2013 use socks or bootees with the nightie if it's cold two cardigans, wool or cotton rather than nylon, and light rather than heavy \u2013 several light layers of clothing are best for keeping your baby warm four vests a shawl or blanket to wrap your baby in a wool or cotton hat, mittens, and socks or bootees for going out if the weather is cold \u2013 it's better to choose close-knitted patterns rather than those with a loose knit, so your baby's fingers and toes won't get caught a sun hat for going out if it's hot or the sun is bright Washing your baby's clothes There's no evidence that using washing powders with enzymes (bio powders) or fabric conditioners will irritate your baby's skin. Baby bedding For the first few months, you'll need a crib, carrycot or Moses basket (a light, portable bassinet). Your baby needs to sleep somewhere that's safe, warm and not too far from you.  Baby nests are not suitable for your baby to sleep in when you're not there because of the danger of suffocation. If you are borrowing a crib or a cot, or using one that has been used by another of your children, you should ideally buy a new mattress. If you can't do this, use the cot mattress you have, as long as it's firm (not soft), flat, fits the cot with no gaps, is clean, and waterproof. You will need: a firm mattress that fits the cot snugly without leaving spaces round the edges, so your baby cannot trap their head and suffocate  sheets to cover the mattress \u2013 you need at least four because they need to be changed often; fitted sheets make life easier but they can be quite expensive, so you could use pieces of old sheet light blankets for warmth Pillows and duvets Don't use pillows and duvets \u2013 they are not safe for babies who are less than a year old because of the risk of suffocation. Duvets can also make your baby too hot. Sheets and layers of blankets tucked in firmly below your baby's shoulder level or a baby sleeping bag are safe for your baby to sleep in. Cot safety Your baby will spend many hours in a cot, so make sure it's safe. If you're buying a new cot, look for the British Standard mark BS EN 716-1. The mattress must fit snugly, with no space for the baby's head to get stuck. The bars must be smooth, securely fixed, and the distance between each bar should be not less than 25mm (1 inch) and not more than 60mm (2.5 inches), so your baby's head can't get trapped. The cot should be sturdy. The moving parts should work smoothly and not allow fingers or clothing to get trapped. Cot bumpers are not recommended as babies can overheat or get tangled in the fastenings. Never leave anything with ties, such as bibs or clothes, in the cot as they might get caught around your baby's neck. The safest place for your baby to sleep is on their back in a cot in the same room as you for the first six months. For more information on safe sleeping, see Reducing the risk of SIDS. You can also visit the Lullaby Trust website, which has lots of information on safe sleeping. Out and about with your baby Spend some time looking at what's available for getting around with your baby. Think about what will suit you best before you make a choice, and ask other mums what they've found useful. Before buying a pushchair or a pram, check that: the brakes are in good working order the handles are at the right height for pushing the frame is strong enough Baby carriers Baby carriers \u2013 also called slings \u2013 are attached with straps and your baby is carried in front of you. Most babies like being carried like this because they're close to you and warm. The back part of the carrier must be high enough to support your baby's head. Check that buckles and straps are secure. Older babies who can hold up their heads and whose backs are stronger \u2013 at about four months \u2013 can be carried in carriers that go on your back.  See the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) website for more advice on using baby carriers and slings safely. Pushchairs Pushchairs, also known as strollers and buggies, are only suitable for young babies if they have fully reclining seats, so your baby can lie flat. Wait until your baby can sit by themselves before using another type of pushchair. Choose a light pushchair if you will be lifting it on to trains or buses. Prams Prams give your baby a lot of space to sit and lie comfortably, but they take up a lot of space and are hard to use on public transport. If you have a car, look for a pram that can be dismantled easily. Consider buying a pram harness at the same time, as you may need it to strap your baby securely into the pram. Carrycot on wheels A carrycot is a light, portable cot with handles, similar to but smaller than the body of a pram, and often attachable to a wheeled frame. Your baby can sleep in the carrycot for the first few months, and the cot can be attached to the frame to go out. Three-in-one travel system This is a carrycot and transporter (a set of wheels) that can be converted into a pushchair when your baby outgrows the carrycot. Shopping trays that fit under the pushchair or pram can also be very useful when you're out. Car seats for babies If you've got a car, you must have a baby car seat. Your baby must always go in their seat, including when you bring them home from the hospital. It's illegal and also very dangerous to carry your baby in your arms in a vehicle. The best way for your baby to travel is in a rear-facing infant car seat on the back seat, or the front passenger seat as long as it is not fitted with an airbag. The car seat is held in place by the adult safety belt. The following advice should help make sure your baby's car seat is as safe as possible: Make sure the car seat is fitted correctly. It is illegal and extremely dangerous to put a rear-facing infant car seat in the front passenger seat if your car is fitted with an airbag. Ideally, buy a new car seat. If you're planning to get a secondhand seat, only accept one from a family member or friend so you can be sure it hasn't been involved in an accident. Don't buy one from a secondhand shop or through the classified ads. Look for the United Nations ECE Regulation number R44.03 or R44.04, or the new i-size regulation R129, when you buy a car seat. For more advice on choosing and fitting baby car seats safely, go to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) website on child car seats.

These are to make sure they stay healthy and are developing normally. The reviews will usually be done by your health visitor or a member of the health visiting team. The team works closely with your GP and the staff at your local children's centre. Reviews may be done in your home or at the GP surgery, well baby clinic, or children's centre. Appointments can be arranged so both you and your partner are there. The reviews are an opportunity for you both to ask questions and discuss any concerns you may have. The personal child health record (red book) Shortly before or after your baby is born, you'll be given a personal child health record (PCHR). This usually has a red cover and is often called the \"red book\". It's a handy way for you to keep track of your child's health and progress, and can be shared with their health professionals. It's a good idea to take your baby's red book with you every time you visit the baby clinic, GP, or hospital. Your baby's health professionals will use it to record your child's weight and height, vaccinations, and other important health information. Find out more about your baby's vaccinations. You can also add information to the red book yourself. You may want to record any illnesses or accidents your baby has, and details of any medicines they take. You'll find it helpful to keep the developmental milestones section of the red book up-to-date and fill in the relevant questionnaires before each routine review. An electronic version of the red book is available in some areas. Find out more about the eRedbook. What happens at your baby's reviews During your baby's reviews, your health visitor will discuss your baby's progress and ask if you have any concerns. If your baby was born prematurely, their developmental age will be calculated from your original due date, not from the actual date they were born, until they are two years old. Your baby will be weighed regularly, but health professionals will want to avoid weighing them too often. This is because babies' weight gain can vary from week to week. Leaving a few weeks between weigh-ins gives a clearer idea of their progress. See how often your baby will be weighed. When your baby will have their reviews Your baby will usually have reviews at the ages outlined below. If you have any concerns at other times, contact your health visitor or GP, or go to your local baby clinic. Shortly after birth Your baby will be weighed at birth and again during their first week. They will also have a thorough physical examination within 72 hours of being born. A medical professional will usually check your baby's eyes, heart, hips, and \u2013 for baby boys \u2013 testes. Read more about the newborn physical examination. At five to eight days, but ideally at five days, your baby will have a blood spot (heel prick) test, which screens for a number of rare diseases, including cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. This is usually done by the midwife. See more about the blood spot (heel prick) test. Your baby will have a hearing test soon after birth. If you have your baby in hospital, this may be done before you leave. Otherwise, it will be done some time in the first few weeks at the hearing centre in your local hospital. See what the newborn hearing test involves. Your midwife and health visitor will also support you with breastfeeding, caring for your new baby, and adjusting to life as new parents. One to two weeks Your health visitor will carry out a new baby review with you and your partner within 10 to 14 days of the birth. They'll work with you on becoming parents and how to keep your baby safe and healthy. You and your partner will also be offered support with breastfeeding if you need it. Six to eight weeks Your baby will be invited for a thorough physical examination. This is usually done by your GP. Your baby's eyes, heart, hips, and \u2013 for boys \u2013 testicles will be checked. They will also have their weight, length, and head circumference measured. Your GP or health visitor will also discuss your baby's vaccinations with you. In the first year these are offered from 8, 12, and 16 weeks. The health visitor will also talk to you about your emotional wellbeing since the birth of your baby. See more information about the NHS vaccination schedule. Nine months to one year During this time, your baby should be offered another review looking at several areas, including language and learning, safety, diet, and behaviour. This is usually done by the health visitor or a member of the health visiting team, and is an opportunity for you and your partner to discuss any concerns you may have. You may be asked to fill in a short questionnaire to help your health visitor understand how your baby is developing. One to three years At one year of age your baby will have their next set of routine vaccinations. Between the ages of two and six, including school years 1 and 2, they will also be offered annual flu vaccinations, which are given as a nasal spray. At two to two-and-a-half years they will have another health and development review. This is usually done by a nursery nurse or the health visitor, and may happen at your home, baby clinic, the children's centre, or your child's nursery if they're attending one. They'll encourage you to talk about your child's progress and will help you with any concerns. You may be asked to fill in a short questionnaire about your baby's development. It's best if both you and your partner are there. If your child attends an early years setting, such as a nursery or childminder, the review may be linked to your child's early years progress check at age two. The review will cover: general development, including movement, speech, social skills and behaviour, and hearing and vision growth, healthy eating, and keeping active managing behaviour and encouraging good sleeping habits tooth brushing and going to the dentist  keeping your child safe vaccinations Three years onwards Your child will have another vaccination \u2013 sometimes called the preschool booster \u2013 at the age of three years, four months. They will also have annual flu vaccinations up to the age of six. Once your child reaches school age, the school nursing team and school staff will help support their health and development. They will work with you to make sure your child is offered the right vaccinations and health reviews. The school nursing team can also give you advice and support on all aspects of your child's health and wellbeing, including emotional and social issues.

Here's a quick guide to everything you need to know about caring for your new baby during those exhausting but wonderful early weeks. Getting to know your newborn Breastfeeding your new baby Washing and bathing your baby How to change your baby's nappy Soothing a crying baby Helping your baby to sleep How to tell if your baby is seriously ill Reducing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) Getting to know your new baby How do we look after our baby's umbilical cord? How much can our baby see? Why are their genitals swollen? Newborn babies don't come with an instruction manual and you're bound to have lots of questions about their behaviour and appearance to begin with. You can find some of the answers you need in Getting to know your newborn. Breastfeeding your new baby In the beginning it can seem like you're doing nothing but feeding, but gradually you and your baby will get into a pattern and the amount of milk you produce will settle. Feed your baby as often as they want. This is called baby-led feeding. Let your baby decide when they've had enough.  Find out more about: Breastfeeding: the first few days Soothing sore or cracked nipples How to tell if your baby is getting enough milk Washing and bathing your new baby You don't need to bathe your baby in the first few days. You may prefer to wash their face, neck, hands and bottom carefully instead. This is sometimes called \"topping and tailing\". Choose a time when your baby is awake and content. Make sure the room is warm and get everything ready beforehand. You'll need a bowl of warm water, a towel, cotton wool, a fresh nappy and, if necessary, clean clothes. See how to 'top and tail' or bathe your new baby. How to change your baby's nappy Babies need frequent nappy changes, but how often they need changing depends on how sensitive their skin is.  Some babies have very delicate skin and need changing as soon as they wet themselves, otherwise their skin becomes sore and red. Other babies can wait to be changed until before or after every feed. All babies need changing as soon as possible when they've done a poo (stool) to prevent nappy rash. Find out more about: Changing your baby's nappy  How to prevent nappy rash Soothing a crying baby Crying is your baby's way of telling you they need comfort and care. But it's not always easy to work out what they want. Find out why your baby may be crying and how to soothe them.  Helping your baby to sleep It's normal for new babies to only sleep for two to three hours at a time through the night as well as during the day. One reason is that newborn babies aren't tuned into day and night yet. Babies also grow quickly in the early months and they have very small stomachs. This means they need to feed little and often. As your baby grows, they'll gradually start to need fewer night feeds and will sleep for longer at night. See how to get your baby into healthy sleep habits. How to tell if your baby is seriously ill It can be difficult to tell when a baby is seriously ill. Above all, it's important to trust your instincts. You know your baby better than anyone else, so you'll know if their appearance or behaviour is worrying. For a checklist of \"red alert\" symptoms that should always be treated as serious, see Does your child have a serious illness?.  Reducing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) SIDS is rare, so don't let worrying about it stop you enjoying your baby's first few months. Putting your baby on their back to sleep, in a cot in the same room as you, for the first six months is one way to reduce your baby's risk even further.  Not smoking during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and not letting anyone else smoke in the same room as your baby, will also help to protect them. See some more tips on reducing the risk of SIDS. Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video. How can I cope with a lack of sleep?

It may be triggered by bad posture while sitting or standing, bending awkwardly, or lifting incorrectly. It's not generally caused by a serious condition. Find out more about the causes of back pain. In most cases back pain will improve in a few weeks or months, although some people experience long-term pain or pain that keeps coming back. Types of back pain Backache is most common in the lower back (lumbago), although it can be felt anywhere along your spine, from your neck down to your hips. Read information on neck pain and shoulder pain, which are covered separately. Sometimes back pain can be caused by an injury or disease, such as: a slipped disc \u2013 when one of the discs in the spine is damaged and presses on the nerves sciatica \u2013 irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve, which causes pain, numbness and tingling that travels down one leg whiplash \u2013 neck injury caused by a sudden impact frozen shoulder \u2013 inflammation around the shoulder that causes pain and stiffness ankylosing spondylitis \u2013 a long-term condition that causes pain and stiffness where the spine meets the pelvis The rest of this information will focus on back pain that doesn't have an obvious cause. Doctors call this non-specific back pain. What to do Most cases of back pain get better on their own and you may not need to see a doctor. If you've only had back pain for a few days or weeks, the following advice may help relieve your symptoms and speed up your recovery: remain as active as possible and try to continue with your daily activities take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen if you feel you need to use hot or cold compression packs \u2013 you can buy these from your local pharmacy, or a bag of frozen vegetables and a hot water bottle will work just as well Although it can be difficult to be cheerful or optimistic if you are in pain, it's important to stay positive as this can help you recover faster. Read more about treatments for short-term back pain. Treatments for long-term back pain If you're worried about your back or your pain hasn't improved by around six weeks, it's a good idea to visit your GP, who can advise you about the treatments available. These include: stronger painkillers exercise classes \u2013 where you are taught specific exercises to strengthen your muscles and improve your posture manual therapy \u2013 such as physiotherapy, chiropractic or osteopathy acupuncture counselling \u2013 such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) support and advice at a specialist pain clinic Some people choose to see a therapist for manual therapy or acupuncture without seeing their GP first. If you want to do this, you will usually need to pay for private treatment, which is likely to cost around £30-50 for each appointment. Spinal surgery is usually only recommended when all else has failed. Read more about treating long-term back pain. Preventing back pain How you sit, stand, lie and lift can all affect the health of your back. Try to avoid placing too much pressure on your back and ensure it's strong and supple. Regular exercise, such as walking and swimming, is an excellent way of preventing back pain. Activities such as yoga or pilates can improve your flexibility and strengthen your back muscles. See the back pain guide for advice about how to sit, stand and lift correctly to avoid backache, or read more about preventing back pain. Signs of a serious problem You should seek urgent medical help if you have back pain and: a high temperature (fever) unexplained weight loss a swelling or a deformity in your back it's constant and doesn't ease after lying down pain in your chest loss of bladder or bowel control an inability to pass urine numbness around your genitals, buttocks or back passage it's worse at night it started after an accident, such as after a car accident These problems could be a sign of something more serious and need to be assessed as soon as possible.

The pain and stiffness usually gets better after a few days or weeks, and is rarely a sign of a more serious problem. You can get a painful or stiff neck if you sleep in an awkward position, use a computer for a prolonged period of time, or strain a muscle because of bad posture. Anxiety and stress can also sometimes cause tension in your neck muscles, which can lead to pain in your neck. You can normally manage your symptoms at home by following the advice below. Managing neck pain at home For most of the types of neck pain described above, the advice is generally the same: carry on with your normal daily activities, keep active, and take painkillers to relieve the symptoms. You can also take these steps to manage your pain: take regular doses of paracetamol, ibuprofen, or a combination of the two, to control pain \u2013 ibuprofen gel can be rubbed on to your neck as an alternative to taking tablets (always follow the instructions that come with the medication) try holding a hot water bottle or heat pack to your neck \u2013 this can help reduce the pain and any muscle spasms, although some people find cold packs offer better relief sleep on a low, firm pillow at night \u2013 using too many pillows may force your neck to bend unnaturally check your posture \u2013 bad posture can aggravate the pain, and it may have caused it in the first place avoid wearing a neck collar \u2013 there is no evidence to suggest wearing a neck collar will help to heal your neck, and it's generally better to keep your neck mobile avoid driving if you find it difficult to turn your head \u2013 this may prevent you being able to view traffic if your neck is stiff or twisted, try some neck exercises \u2013 gently tense your neck muscles as you tilt your head up and down and from side to side, and as you carefully twist your neck from left to right; these exercises will help strengthen your neck muscles and improve your range of movement You can find more information about neck exercises on the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy website. When to see your GP See your GP if the pain or stiffness does not improve after a few days or weeks, if you cannot control the pain using ordinary painkillers, or if you are worried your neck pain could have a more serious cause. Your GP will examine your neck and ask some questions to help identify any underlying condition. They may also prescribe a stronger painkiller, such as codeine, to take with your usual over-the-counter painkillers. If you have had neck pain or stiffness for a month or more, your GP may be able to refer you to a physiotherapist. If your symptoms are particularly severe or do not improve, your GP may consider prescribing more powerful medication or referring you to a pain specialist for further treatment. Read more about living with pain for further information and advice about persistent pain. What causes neck pain and stiffness? A twisted or locked neck Some people suddenly wake up one morning to find their neck twisted to one side and stuck in that position. This is known as acute torticollis and is caused by injury to the neck muscles. The exact cause of acute torticollis is unknown, but it may be caused by bad posture, sleeping without adequate neck support, or carrying heavy unbalanced loads (for example, carrying a heavy bag with one arm). Acute torticollis can take up to a week to get better, but it usually only lasts 24 to 48 hours. Wear and tear in the neck Sometimes neck pain is caused by the \"wear and tear\" that occurs to the bones and joints in your neck. This is a type of arthritis called cervical spondylosis. Cervical spondylosis occurs naturally with age. It does not always cause symptoms, although in some people the bone changes can cause neck stiffness. Nearby nerves can also be squashed, resulting in pain that radiates from the arms, pins and needles, and numbness in the hands and legs. Most cases will improve with treatment in a few weeks. Whiplash Whiplash is a neck injury caused by a sudden movement of the head forwards, backwards or sideways. It often occurs after a sudden impact such as a road traffic accident. The vigorous movement of the head overstretches and damages the tendons and ligaments in the neck. As well as neck pain and stiffness, whiplash can cause tenderness in the neck muscles, reduced and painful neck movements, and headaches. Pinched nerve Neck pain caused by a squashed nerve is known as cervical radiculopathy. It's usually caused by one of the discs between the bones of the upper spine (vertebrae) splitting open and the gel inside bulging outwards on to a nearby nerve. The condition is more common in older people because your spinal discs start to lose their water content as you get older, making them less flexible and more likely to split. The pain can sometimes be controlled with painkillers and by following the advice below, although surgery may be recommended for some people. More serious causes Your neck pain may have a more serious cause if it's persistent and getting progressively worse, or you have additional symptoms, such as: a lack of co-ordination \u2013 you may find fiddly tasks increasingly difficult problems walking loss of bladder or bowel control a high temperature (fever) unexplained weight loss A serious cause is more likely if you have recently had a significant injury \u2013 for example, you were involved in a car accident or had a fall \u2013 or you have a history of cancer or conditions that weaken your immune system, such as HIV. See your GP if you are concerned. Preventing neck pain You may find the following advice helpful in preventing neck pain: make sure you have good posture when sitting and standing \u2013 read more about how to sit correctly, how to use a laptop safely, and common posture mistakes and fixes take regular breaks from your desk, driving or any activity where your neck is held in the same position for a long period of time if you often feel stressed, try relaxation techniques to help ease any tension in your neck avoid sleeping on your front, and make sure your head is in line with your body (not tilted to the side) if you sleep on your side only use enough pillows (usually only one) to keep your head level with your body   make sure your mattress is relatively firm \u2013 a soft mattress could mean your neck is bent while you sleep Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 10\/12\/2014 Next review due: 10\/12\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The sciatic nerve is the longest nerve in your body. It runs from the back of your pelvis, through your buttocks, and all the way down both legs, ending at your feet. Signs and symptoms When the sciatic nerve is compressed or irritated, it can cause pain, numbness and a tingling sensation that radiates from your lower back and travels down one of your legs to your foot and toes. The pain can range from being mild to very painful, and may be made worse by sneezing, coughing, or sitting for a long period of time. Some people with sciatica may also experience muscle weakness in the affected leg. While people with sciatica can also have general back pain, the pain associated with sciatica usually affects the buttocks and legs much more than the back. When to see your GP Most people find their sciatic pain goes away naturally within a few weeks, although some cases can last for a year or more. You should see your GP if your symptoms are severe or persistent, or are getting worse over time. Your GP will usually be able to confirm a diagnosis of sciatica based on your symptoms and recommend suitable treatments. If necessary, they can refer you to a specialist for further investigation. You should immediately call 999 for an ambulance if you experience loss of sensation between your legs and around your buttocks and\/or loss of bladder or bowel control. Although it is rare, these symptoms can be a sign of a serious condition called cauda equina syndrome. Read more about diagnosing sciatica. What causes sciatica? In the vast majority of cases, sciatica is caused by a herniated or \"slipped\" disc. This is when one of the discs that sit between the bones of the spine (the vertebrae) is damaged and presses on the nerves. Less common causes include spinal stenosis (narrowing of the nerve passages in the spine), a spinal injury or infection, or a growth within the spine (such as a tumour). You can minimise your risk of developing a slipped disc or back injury that could lead to sciatica by adopting a better posture and lifting techniques at work, as well as stretching before and after exercise, and exercising regularly. Read more about the causes of sciatica and preventing sciatica. How sciatica is treated Many cases of sciatica will pass in around six weeks without the need for treatment. However, a combination of things you can do at home \u2013 such as taking over-the-counter painkillers, exercising and using hot or cold packs \u2013 may help reduce the symptoms until the condition improves. In more persistent cases, you may be advised to follow a structured exercise programme under the supervision of a physiotherapist, have injections of anti-inflammatory and painkilling medication into your spine, and\/or take stronger painkiller tablets. In rare cases, surgery may be needed to correct the problem in your spine. Read more about treating sciatica. Sciatica Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

This can cause back pain and neck pain, as well as symptoms such as numbness, a tingling sensation, or weakness in other areas of the body. The sciatic nerve is often affected in cases of slipped disc. It is the longest nerve in the body and runs from the back of the pelvis, through the buttocks and down both legs to the feet. If pressure is placed on the sciatic nerve (sciatica), it can cause mild to severe pain in the leg, hip or buttocks. Read more about the symptoms of a slipped disc. The spine The spine consists of 24 individual bones called vertebrae that are stacked on top of each other. In between each vertebra there are protective circular pads of cartilage (connective tissue) called discs, which have a tough, fibrous case that contains a softer gel-like substance. The discs help maintain your back's flexibility and wide range of movement. The spinal cord is highly sensitive and passes through the middle of the vertebral column. It contains nerve cells and bundles of nerve fibres that connect all parts of the body to the brain. What causes a slipped disc? A slipped disc occurs when the outer case of the disc splits, resulting in the gel inside bulging out of the disc. The damaged disc can put pressure on the whole spinal cord or on a single nerve root (where a nerve leaves the spinal cord). This means a slipped disc can cause pain both in the area of the protruding disc and in the area of the body controlled by the nerve that the disc is pressing on. It is not always clear what causes a disc to break down, although age is a common factor in many cases. As you get older, your spinal discs start to lose their water content, making them less flexible and more likely to rupture. Smoking also plays a role as it causes the discs to lose their natural flexibility. It's important to note not all slipped discs cause symptoms such as pain, weakness or tingling. Many people will go their whole life and not know they have a slipped disc, even though they have one. Read more about what causes a slipped disc. Diagnosing a slipped disc Your GP will usually be able to diagnose a slipped disc from your symptoms and medical history. They may also carry out a physical examination to test your: posture reflexes muscle strength walking ability sensation in your limbs Read more about how a slipped disc is diagnosed. Treating a slipped disc It can take about four to six weeks to recover from a slipped disc. Treatment usually involves a combination of physical therapy, such as massage and exercise, and medication to relieve the pain. Surgery to release the compressed nerve and remove part of the disc may be considered in severe cases, or if the pain continues for longer than six weeks. In many cases, a slipped disc will eventually shrink back away from the nerve and the pain will ease as the disc stops pressing on the affected nerve. Often the slipped disc will stay pressing on the nerve, but the pain goes away because the brain learns to \"turn down the volume\" on the pain messages coming from the nerve. If you have a slipped disc, it is very important to keep active. Initially moving may be difficult, but after resting for a couple of days you should start to move around.  This will help keep your back mobile and stop the joints becoming stiff and the muscles that support the spine becoming weak. Keeping moving will speed up your recovery. Any exercise you do should be gentle and not put too much strain on your back. Exercises that involve high impact, such as running, jumping or twisting, should be avoided at first as they may cause a flare-up of the pain. Read more about treating a slipped disc. Preventing a slipped disc Taking a few sensible precautions, such as leading a healthy lifestyle, can help prevent back pain and lower your risk of getting a slipped disc. For example, you should: take regular exercise use a safe technique when lifting heavy objects always maintain a good posture when sitting and standing quit smoking if you smoke Read more about preventing a slipped disc.

Slipped discs are most common in people aged between 30 and 50 years old. The condition affects twice as many men as women. Slipped discs often occur in the lower back. While around a third of adults in the UK have lower back pain, fewer than 1 in 20 people have a slipped disc.

It's most common in the lower back (lumbar spine), but it can also occur in the mid to upper back (thoracic spine) or the neck (cervical spine). Spondylolisthesis isn't the same as a slipped disc, which is where one of the spinal discs between the vertebrae ruptures. Symptoms of spondylolisthesis  Many people may not realise they have spondylolisthesis because it doesn't always cause symptoms. Symptoms can include: lower back pain \u2013 which is usually worse during activity and when standing, and is often relieved by lying down pain, numbness or a tingling sensation radiating from your lower back down your legs (sciatica) \u2013 this occurs if the slipped vertebra presses on a nerve tight hamstring muscles stiffness or tenderness in your back excessive curvature of the spine (kyphosis) The severity of these symptoms can vary considerably from person to person.

There are five main types of spondylolisthesis, each with a different cause. Spondylolisthesis can be caused by: a birth defect in part of the vertebra \u2013 this can cause it to slip forward (dysplastic spondylolisthesis) repetitive trauma to the spine \u2013 this results in a defect developing in the vertebra, which can cause it to slip; this is known as isthmic spondylolisthesis and is more common in athletes such as gymnasts and weightlifters the joints of the vertebrae becoming worn and arthritic \u2013 this is known as degenerative spondylolisthesis and is more common in older people a sudden injury or trauma to the spine \u2013 such as a fracture, which can result in the vertebra slipping forward (traumatic spondylolisthesis) a bone abnormality \u2013 this could be caused by a tumour, for example (pathologic spondylolisthesis) When to see your GP You should see your GP if: you have persistent back pain or stiffness you have persistent pain in your thighs or buttocks your back curves outwards excessively Your GP may examine your back, although there aren't usually any visible signs of spondylolisthesis. Your GP may ask you to do a straight leg raise test, where you lie on your back while your GP holds your foot and lifts your leg up, keeping your knee straight. This is often painful if you have spondylolisthesis. Spondylolisthesis can easily be confirmed by taking an X-ray of your spine from the side while you're standing. This will show whether a vertebra has slipped out of position or if you have a fracture. If you have pain, numbness, tingling or weakness in your legs, you may need additional imaging tests, such as a computerised tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. These more detailed scans will be able to help determine whether you have a compressed nerve in your back. Treating spondylolisthesis The way spondylolisthesis is treated will depend on your symptoms and how severe they are. In most cases non-surgical treatments will be recommended first. Non-surgical treatments Initial treatments for spondylolisthesis may include: a short period of rest, avoiding activities such as bending, lifting, contact sports and athletics anti-inflammatory painkillers, such as ibuprofen, or stronger painkillers available on prescription can help reduce pain and inflammation physiotherapy \u2013 simple stretching and strengthening exercises may help increase the range of motion in your lower back and hamstrings if you have pain, numbness and tingling in your legs, corticosteroid injections around the compressed nerve and into the spinal canal may be recommended These measures will only provide temporary symptom relief, but your symptoms may disappear completely with time. Back braces sometimes used to be recommended for some people with spondylolisthesis. However, there are concerns that bracing may actually weaken the spine and fail to improve symptoms. Surgery Surgery may be recommended if non-surgical treatments are ineffective and your symptoms are severe, persistent, or suggest you have a compressed nerve in your spine. The exact surgical procedure you need will depend on the type of spondylolisthesis you have. It usually involves fusing the slipped vertebra to the neighbouring vertebrae using metal screws and rods, and a piece of your own bone taken from an area nearby. The screws and rods are usually left in place permanently. In some cases the spinal disc being compressed between your vertebrae may also be removed. It will be replaced by a small \"cage\" containing a bone graft to hold your vertebrae apart. The operation is performed under general anaesthetic, which means you'll be unconscious while it's carried out.  Surgery is often effective at relieving many of the symptoms of spondylolisthesis, particularly pain and numbness in the legs. However, it's a major operation that involves up to a week-long stay in hospital and a recovery period lasting months, where you have to limit your activities. Spinal surgery for spondylolisthesis also carries a risk of potentially serious complications, including: infection at the site of the operation a blood clot developing in one of the veins in your leg \u2013 known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) damage to the spinal nerves or spinal cord, resulting in continuing symptoms, numbness or weakness in the legs, or, in rare cases, some degree of paralysis or loss of bowel or bladder control Because of the possibility of complications, make sure you discuss the operation in detail with your doctor or surgeon before deciding to have surgery.

It is also known as infectious or bacterial arthritis. The condition is most commonly caused by staphylococcal or streptococcal bacteria. These bacteria may have entered a wound and travelled through your bloodstream to the affected joint, or may have infected your joint directly following an injury or during surgery. Any joint can be affected by septic arthritis \u2013 and more than one joint can be affected at a time \u2013 but the condition is most common in the knees and hips. You should see your GP or visit your local accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible if you think you or your child may have septic arthritis. The sooner the infection is picked up and treated, the better the outlook. If the condition is left untreated, it can become life-threatening and can lead to permanent joint damage. Signs and symptoms Septic arthritis typically causes severe pain, swelling, redness and heat in affected joints. These symptoms tend to develop quickly over a few hours or days. You may also have difficulty moving the affected joint and some people have a high temperature (fever). Young children with septic arthritis will generally be irritable and may cry whenever the infected joint is moved (for example, during nappy changing). They may also try to avoid using or putting any weight on affected joints. Who's at risk? Septic arthritis can be seen at any age, including in babies and infants, although it is less common in older children, teenagers and young adults. The following factors can increase your risk of septic arthritis: having an artificial joint implant, such as a knee replacement or hip replacement having a bacterial infection somewhere else in your body having a long-term condition such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis using injected drugs taking medication that suppresses your immune system recently injuring a joint recently having joint surgery or injections into your joints Diagnosis septic arthritis If your symptoms suggest septic arthritis, your GP will refer you to your nearest A&E department immediately for an assessment. You may have a blood test and a sample of fluid removed from your affected joint with a needle to look for signs of inflammation and infection, and to identify any bacteria. If you have septic arthritis, there may be high numbers of white blood cells (a sign of infection) in your blood and joint fluid. However, in many cases these tests come back normal, so they cannot be relied upon to rule out the infection. Treating septic arthritis Septic arthritis is treated with antibiotics. You will normally need to stay in hospital for at least two weeks to have antibiotics given to you intravenously (directly into a vein). You may need to rest in bed for a few days to take pressure off the affected joint and you will be given medication to relieve the pain. You might also have the fluid drained from your infected joint using a needle and syringe, or during a procedure called an arthroscopy (where a fine, metal tube is inserted through a small incision near the affected joint). This will normally be done by the orthopaedic surgeon. After you finish the course of intravenous antibiotics, you'll probably need to take antibiotic tablets at home for at least another four weeks. You should completely recover after antibiotic treatment, although some people still experience persistent limited movement in the affected joint.

BV doesn't usually cause any vaginal soreness or itching, but often causes unusual vaginal discharge. If you have the condition, your discharge may: develop a strong fishy smell, particularly after sexual intercourse become white or grey become thin and watery BV isn't serious for the vast majority of women, although it may be a concern if symptoms of BV develop in pregnancy and you have a history of pregnancy-related complications. Around half of women with bacterial vaginosis have no symptoms. When to seek medical advice See your GP or visit a sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic if you notice any abnormal discharge from your vagina, especially if you're pregnant. It's important to get this checked to rule out other infections and prevent complications. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and may examine your vagina. In some cases, a small sample of the vaginal discharge will be taken using a plastic loop or swab, so it can be examined for signs of BV. Read more about diagnosing bacterial vaginosis. Why it happens The vagina naturally contains a mix of many different bacteria. In cases of BV, the number of certain bacteria increases, affecting the balance of chemicals in the vagina. What leads to these changes in the levels of bacteria is not clear. BV isn't classified as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), but you're at a higher risk of developing the condition if you're sexually active. Women with BV may be able to pass the condition to other women they have sex with, although it's not clear how this happens. There's no evidence to suggest the bacteria causing BV can affect male sexual partners. There are also a number of other factors that can increase your risk of developing BV, including: using scented soaps or bubble baths having an intrauterine device (IUD) fitted using vaginal deodorant BV is more common in women who use a coil for contraception and those who perform vaginal douching (cleaning out the vagina). Read more about the causes of bacterial vaginosis. Treatment  BV can usually be successfully treated using a short course of antibiotic tablets or an antibiotic gel you apply inside your vagina. In most cases, you'll be prescribed antibiotic tablets to take twice a day for five to seven days. However, it's common for BV to return. More than half of women successfully treated with BV find their symptoms return, usually within three months. Women who have frequent episodes of BV may be referred to a GUM specialist. Read more about treating bacterial vaginosis. Complications If BV develops in pregnancy, it may increase the risk of pregnancy-related complications, such as premature birth or miscarriage. However, this risk is small and appears more significant for women who have had these complications in a previous pregnancy. BV causes no problems in the vast majority of pregnancies. As a precaution, you should contact your GP or GUM clinic if you're pregnant and you begin to have vaginal discharge (although discharge can be a normal part of pregnancy). Bacterial vaginosis can also increase your risk of getting some STIs. Read more about the complications of bacterial vaginosis. Prevention The causes of BV aren't fully understood, so it's not possible to completely prevent it. However, you may be able to lower your risk of developing the condition if you avoid: using scented soaps, perfumed bubble bath and antiseptic bath liquids using vaginal deodorant vaginal douching using strong detergents to wash your underwear These can upset the natural bacterial balance in your vagina, making it more likely that you'll develop BV.

About one in four people are thought to have bad breath (halitosis) on a regular basis. What causes bad breath? There are a number of things that can cause bad breath. It's usually the result of poor oral hygiene. If bacteria build up in your mouth, the toxins produced can cause your breath to smell.  Bacteria break down pieces of food in the mouth, and may release an unpleasant-smelling gas. Any food trapped on your teeth \u2013 particularly between them \u2013 is broken down by bacteria, which may cause bad breath. Persistent bad breath can sometimes be a sign of gum disease. Eating strongly flavoured foods, such as onions and garlic, can also cause your breath to smell, as can smoking and drinking alcohol. Occasionally, bad breath can occur after an infection or illness, or as a result of taking certain types of medication. Read more about the causes of bad breath. Treating and preventing bad breath Improving your oral hygiene is usually enough to cure bad breath and stop it happening again. To improve your oral health, make sure you: floss between your teeth daily brush your teeth and gums regularly clean your tongue regularly Read more about treating and preventing bad breath. When to seek medical advice See your dentist, dental hygienist or dental therapist first if you still have bad breath after making changes to improve your dental hygiene. You may also need to visit your GP as there may be a medical cause that needs to be investigated. Don't try to hide the smell of your breath when seeking medical advice as it may make it more difficult to find out what's causing the problem. Do I have bad breath? It's not always easy to tell if you have bad breath. Other people may notice it first, but they could feel uncomfortable telling you. A simple test to find out whether you have bad breath is to lick the inside of your wrist with the back of your tongue and wait a few seconds until the saliva dries. If your wrist smells unpleasant, it's likely your breath does, too.

It's caused when the tissue behind the knee joint becomes swollen and inflamed. The swelling and inflammation can cause: pain in the knee and calf a build-up of fluid around the knee occasional locking or clicking in the knee joint However, sometimes a Baker's cyst may not cause any symptoms other than the fluid-filled swelling at the back of the knee. In rare cases, a Baker's cyst can burst (rupture), resulting in fluid leaking down into your calf. This can cause sharp pain, swelling and redness in your calf. What causes a Baker's cyst? Knee damage caused by a sports-related injury or a blow to the knee can lead to a Baker's cyst developing. A Baker's cyst can also sometimes occur if you have a health condition such as: osteoarthritis \u2013 usually caused by age-related \"wear and tear\" of joints; it particularly affects the knees, hips, hands and big toe inflammatory arthritis \u2013 including rheumatoid arthritis which is a less common type of arthritis and is caused by the immune system attacking the joints gout \u2013 a type of arthritis that usually affects the big toe and is caused by a build-up of the waste product uric acid in the blood Baker's cysts are more common in women than men, probably because women are more likely to develop osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. They usually develop in people aged over 40, although can affect people of any age, including children. When to see your GP See your GP if you have a cyst that's causing problems and doesn't clear up on its own. They'll usually be able to diagnose a Baker's cyst by examining the back of your knee and asking about your symptoms. Your GP will ask you whether you have any associated health conditions, such as arthritis. Further tests may be recommended to rule out other more serious conditions, such as a tumour, an aneurysm (bulge in a section of a blood vessel) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (blood clot in one of the deep veins of the body). You may need an ultrasound scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Treating a Baker's cyst Treatment won't usually be necessary if you have a Baker's cyst that isn't causing any symptoms. Over-the-counter painkillers can be used to reduce the swelling of a Baker's cyst and relieve any pain. Bandages or an ice pack may also help. A bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel works well as an ice pack. If you have an underlying condition that's causing your cyst, it's important that the condition is properly managed. The cyst may disappear when the condition causing it has been treated. In some cases, it may be possible to drain the cyst. Surgery may also be needed to repair any significant damage around the knee joint. Read more about treating a Baker's cyst.

The foreskin (the loose flap of skin that covers the head of the penis) is also often affected. Balanitis is a common condition affecting both boys and men. It occurs more often in men who have not been circumcised. Symptoms can include: redness, swelling and soreness around the head of the penis or foreskin a thick discharge under the foreskin a rash on the penis itchiness an unpleasant odour pain when urinating Some people may also have a tight foreskin that will not retract (pull back). This is called phimosis. When to seek medical advice Balanitis is not usually serious, but it can be a sign of another condition, such as a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or thrush (a type of fungal infection). It's therefore important to visit your GP or a local sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic if you think you have balanitis. You should also see your GP if your son has symptoms of balanitis. Read more about diagnosing balanitis. What causes balanitis? Skin irritation is the most common cause of balanitis in boys. This can occur because it's not always possible to pull back the foreskin fully at this age, leading to a build-up of a cheesy-looking substance called smegma that can irritate the skin. Irritation by smegma is also a common cause of balanitis in uncircumcised men if the penis is not kept clean. Other causes of balanitis include: irritation caused by urine or substances such as soaps and shower gels (contact dermatitis) thrush, which is more common in people with diabetes or who have recently taken antibiotics a bacterial infection, usually caused by streptococcal bacteria sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as gonorrhoea, genital herpes and syphilis skin conditions, such as atopic eczema, psoriasis, lichen sclerosus and lichen planus in boys, repeatedly playing with their foreskin In some cases, no cause can be found. How balanitis is treated Most cases of balanitis are easily managed with a combination of creams or ointments, good hygiene and avoiding substances that irritate the penis (see below). This may include corticosteroid, antibiotic and antifungal creams and ointments, depending on what the underlying cause of the condition is. These treatments will usually start to have an effect within a week and can be stopped after around two weeks, although in some people it does eventually come back after treatment. A partial circumcision may sometimes be recommended for a small number of cases of recurring phimosis. Read more about treating balanitis. Preventing balanitis You can reduce your chances of developing balanitis by: avoiding potential irritants, such as soaps, bubble baths and latex condoms keeping your penis clean \u2013 you should wash it with water every day avoiding STIs \u2013 use condoms whenever you have sex and don't share sex toys Babies and young children who still wear nappies should have their nappies changed regularly because the warm and moist conditions can increase their risk of balanitis.

There are many types of hair loss with different symptoms and causes. Some of the more common types of hair loss are described below, including: male- and female-pattern baldness  alopecia areata scarring alopecia anagen effluvium telogen effluvium Male- and female-pattern baldness Male-pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss, affecting around half of all men by 50 years of age. It usually starts around the late twenties or early thirties and most men have some degree of hair loss by their late thirties. It generally follows a pattern of a receding hairline, followed by thinning of the hair on the crown and temples, leaving a horseshoe shape around the back and sides of the head. Sometimes it can progress to complete baldness, although this is uncommon. Male-pattern baldness is hereditary, which means it runs in families. It's thought to be caused by oversensitive hair follicles, linked to having too much of a certain male hormone. As well as affecting men, it can sometimes affect women (female-pattern baldness). During female-pattern baldness, hair usually only thins on top of the head. It's not clear if female-pattern baldness is hereditary and the causes are less well understood. However, it tends to be more noticeable in women who have been through the menopause (when a woman's periods stop at around age 52), perhaps because they have fewer female hormones. Alopecia areata Alopecia areata causes patches of baldness about the size of a large coin. They usually appear on the scalp but can occur anywhere on the body. It can occur at any age, but mostly affects teenagers and young adults. In most cases of alopecia areata, hair will grow back in a few months. At first, hair may grow back fine and white, but over time it should thicken and regain its normal colour. Some people go on to develop a more severe form of hair loss, such as: alopecia totalis (no scalp hair) alopecia universalis (no hair on the scalp and body) Alopecia areata is caused by a problem with the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness). It's more common among people with other autoimmune conditions, such as an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), diabetes or Down's syndrome. It's also believed some people's genes make them more susceptible to alopecia areata, as one in five people with the condition have a family history of the condition. Alopecia areata can occur at any age, although it's more common in people aged 15-29. It affects one or two people in every 1,000 in the UK. Scarring alopecia  Scarring alopecia, also known as cicatricial alopecia, is usually caused by complications of another condition. In this type of alopecia, the hair follicle (the small hole in your skin that an individual hair grows out of) is completely destroyed. This means your hair won't grow back. Depending on the condition, the skin where the hair has fallen out is likely to be affected in some way. Conditions which can cause scarring alopecia include: scleroderma \u2013 a condition affecting the body's connective (supporting) tissues, resulting in hard, puffy and itchy skin lichen planus \u2013 an itchy rash affecting many areas of the body discoid lupus \u2013 a mild form of lupus affecting the skin, causing scaly marks and hair loss folliculitis decalvans \u2013 a rare form of alopecia that most commonly affects men, causing baldness and scarring of the affected areas frontal fibrosing alopecia \u2013 a type of alopecia that affects post-menopausal women where the hair follicles are damaged, and the hair falls out and is unable to grow back Scarring alopecia occurs in both males and females, but is less common in children than adults. It accounts for about 7% of hair loss cases. Anagen effluvium Anagen effluvium is widespread hair loss that can affect your scalp, face and body. One of the most common causes of this type of hair loss is the cancer treatment chemotherapy. In some cases, other cancer treatments \u2013 including immunotherapy and radiotherapy \u2013 may also cause hair loss. The hair loss is usually noticeable within a few weeks of starting treatment. However, not all chemotherapy drugs cause hair loss and sometimes the hair loss is so small it's hardly noticeable. It may be possible to reduce hair loss from chemotherapy by wearing a special cap that keeps the scalp cool. However, scalp cooling is not always effective and not widely available. In most cases, hair loss in anagen effluvium is temporary. Your hair should start to grow back a few months after chemotherapy has stopped. Telogen effluvium Telogen effluvium is a common type of alopecia where there is widespread thinning of the hair, rather than specific bald patches. Your hair may feel thinner, but you're unlikely to lose it all and your other body hair isn't usually affected. Telogen effluvium can be caused by your body reacting to: hormonal changes, such as those that take place when a woman is pregnant intense emotional stress intense physical stress, such as childbirth a short-term illness, such as a severe infection or an operation a long-term illness, such as cancer or liver disease changes in your diet, such as crash dieting some medications, such as anticoagulants (medicines that reduce the ability of your blood to clot) or beta-blockers (used to treat a number of conditions, such as high blood pressure) In most cases of telogen effluvium, your hair will stop falling out and start to grow back within six months. How is hair loss treated? More common types of hair loss, such as male-pattern baldness, don't need treatment because they're a natural part of ageing and don't pose a risk to your health. However, any type of hair loss can be distressing, so you should see your GP if you're worried about it. Your GP should be able to diagnose your type of hair loss by examining your hair. They can also discuss possible treatments with you so it's advisable to visit your GP before trying a private consultant dermatologist (skin care specialist). If you want treatment for male-pattern baldness for cosmetic reasons, two medications called finasteride and minoxidil can be used. Minoxidil can also be used to treat female-pattern baldness. However, these treatments don't work for everyone and only work for as long as they're continued. They are not available on the NHS and can be expensive. Alopecia areata is usually treated with steroid injections, although it's sometimes possible to use a steroid cream, gel or ointment. A treatment called immunotherapy may also be used. This involves stimulating hair growth by causing an intentional allergic reaction in the affected areas of skin. If you have significant hair loss of any type, you may decide to wear a wig. Wigs are available on the NHS, but you may have to pay unless you qualify for help with charges. There are also some surgical options for hair loss, including a hair transplant and artificial hair implants. Read more about treating hair loss. Emotional issues Hair loss can be difficult to come to terms with. The hair on your head can be a defining part of your identity. If you start to lose your hair, it can feel as if you're losing part of your identity. This can affect your self-confidence and sometimes lead to depression. Speak to your GP if you're finding it difficult to deal with your hair loss. They may suggest counselling. You may also benefit from joining a support group or speaking to other people in the same situation \u2013 for example, through online forums. A number of charities, such as Alopecia UK, have support groups and online forums where you can talk to others who are experiencing hair loss.

This type of surgery is only available on the NHS to treat people with potentially life-threatening obesity when other treatments, such as lifestyle changes, haven't worked. Potentially life-threatening obesity is defined as: having a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above having a BMI of 35 or above and having another serious health condition that could be improved if you lose weight, such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure Adults who have recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes may also be considered for an assessment for weight loss surgery if they have a BMI of 30-34.9.  For people who meet the above criteria, weight loss surgery has proved to be effective in significantly and quickly reducing excess body fat.  However, it's always recommended that you try to lose weight through a healthy, calorie-controlled diet and increased amounts of exercise before you consider weight loss surgery, as surgery carries a risk of complications and requires a significant change in lifestyle afterwards. Because of these associated risks, most surgeons, whether they're working privately or for the NHS, would only consider someone for surgery if there was a clinical need, and not for cosmetic reasons. Read more about who can have weight loss surgery. Availability of weight loss surgery Even if you're eligible for weight loss surgery, the demand on the NHS is currently higher than supply in many areas of the country. Therefore, there may be a considerable waiting list. Weight loss surgery is also available privately. Prices are around:  £5,000-8,000 for gastric banding £9,500-15,000 for gastric bypass surgery An increasing number of people are seeking treatment abroad, as costs for private treatment are often cheaper in other countries, but this should be considered carefully. For more information, see planned treatment abroad. Types of weight loss surgery The three most widely used types of weight loss surgery are: gastric band \u2013 where a band is used to reduce the stomach's size, so a smaller amount of food is required to make you feel full gastric bypass \u2013 where your digestive system is re-routed past most of your stomach, so you digest less food and it takes much less to make you feel full sleeve gastrectomy \u2013 where some of the stomach is removed to reduce the amount of food that's required to make you feel full Several other surgical techniques may be recommended in certain circumstances. Read more about how weight loss surgery is performed. Life after weight loss surgery Weight loss surgery can achieve impressive results in terms of the amount of weight lost, but it shouldn't be seen as a magic cure for obesity. People who have had weight loss surgery need to stick to a rigorous and lifelong plan afterwards to avoid putting weight back on or long-term complications. This plan will include: a carefully controlled diet regular exercise The rapid weight loss may cause relationship problems \u2013 for example, with a partner who is also obese \u2013 and it may lead to unwanted loose folds of skin, which may need further surgery to correct. Many people with mental health problems, such as depression or anxiety, find that these problems do not automatically improve because they have lost weight. It's important to have realistic expectations about what life after weight loss surgery will be like. Read more about life after weight loss surgery. Risks As with all types of surgery, weight loss surgery carries the risk of complications, some of which are serious and potentially fatal, such as: internal bleeding a blood clot inside the leg (deep vein thrombosis) a blood clot or other blockage inside the lungs (pulmonary embolism) The overall risk of death in hospital after having any kind of weight loss surgery is around 1 in 1,000. Certain risk factors, such as high blood pressure or a BMI of 50 or above, also increase the risk of complications. Read more about the risks of weight loss surgery. Results As long as a person is willing and able to stick to their agreed plan afterwards, surgery can effectively reduce their weight and treat conditions associated with obesity, such as diabetes. Recent research carried out in America found that, on average: people with a gastric band will lose around half their excess body weight people with a gastric bypass will lose around two-thirds of their excess body weight Both techniques also lead to a considerable improvement (and sometimes a complete cure) of obesity-related conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Read more about the results of weight loss surgery. BMI and obesity The most widely used method of seeing if you're a healthy weight is to calculate your BMI. This is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in metres squared: If your BMI is 25-29.9, you're over the ideal weight for your height (overweight). If your BMI is 30-39.9, you're obese. If your BMI is over 40, you're very obese (known as morbidly obese).

During the test, a white liquid called barium is passed into your bowel through your bottom. A barium enema may be requested by any doctor who thinks you might have a problem with your bowel, including your GP. The test will usually be carried out at a hospital radiology department by a radiologist or radiographer. When barium enemas are used Nowadays, barium enemas aren't carried out very often, as alternative tests such as a colonoscopy or computerised tomography (CT) scan are usually preferred. However, a barium enema can sometimes be a useful way of finding the cause of problems such as blood in your stools or a constant change in your bowel habits. Conditions that can be detected during a barium enema include: bowel cancer growths in the bowel (bowel polyps) inflammation of the bowel (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) pouches in the bowel (diverticular disease) Preparing for a barium enema To ensure the X-ray images taken during a barium enema are clear, your bowel must be empty before the test. The hospital should send you instructions on what you need to do to prepare. You'll normally be asked to: eat a light diet \u2013 for a few days leading up to the test only eat low-fibre foods, such as clear soup, white bread and lean meat take laxative medication \u2013 you'll be given medication that makes you empty your bowels frequently to take from the day before the test drink plenty of fluids \u2013 this will help to replace the fluids you lose each time you empty your bowels It's usually a good idea to stay at home the day before the test, as the laxative medication will make you go to the toilet frequently. Contact the hospital as soon as you receive your appointment letter if you have diabetes or are pregnant (or think you could be pregnant). Barium enemas aren't done during pregnancy, because the X-rays may harm the baby. If you have diabetes, you'll need to follow special instructions to ensure your blood sugar level is kept under control. Having a barium enema When you arrive at hospital, you'll be asked to change into a hospital gown. You can take someone with you to the hospital, but they're not usually allowed into the X-ray room. During the test: you'll be asked to lie on your side on an X-ray table, and an injection of a medication called Buscopan may be given to prevent involuntary bowel movements a small, soft tube will be gently inserted a few centimetres into your bottom, where it will remain throughout the test the barium is passed through the tube and into your bowel \u2013 try to keep the muscles in your bottom tight to prevent it coming back out, but don't worry if some leaks out  you may be asked to move around a bit to help the barium spread along your bowel, and air may be pumped into your bowel to expand it and help push the barium around several X-rays will be taken with you in different positions The whole process usually takes around 20-30 minutes. What happens after a barium enema When the test is finished, the tube will be removed from your bottom and you can go to the toilet to empty your bowels. You should be able to go home shortly afterwards, although it's a good idea to take things easy for a few hours before returning to your normal activities. If you had a Buscopan injection, your vision may be blurry for 30-60 minutes, so you won't be able to drive during this time. It's best to arrange for someone to drive you home. When you get home: stay close to a toilet for the next few hours, as you may find you need to empty your bowels quite often at first your poo may be a whitish colour for a few days \u2013 this is normal and is just the remaining barium passing out of your body you can eat and drink as normal \u2013 drink plenty of fluids and eat high-fibre foods for the first few days, to help stop the barium causing constipation The X-ray images taken during the test will be analysed by a specialist. A report will be sent to the doctor who referred you for the test and you can discuss the results at your next appointment. Does a barium enema hurt? Having a barium enema may be a bit embarrassing and unpleasant, but it shouldn't be painful. You'll probably feel uncomfortable when the air is pumped into your bowel during the test \u2013 similar to the feeling of having trapped wind \u2013 and you may have some bloating, wind or stomach cramps for a short while afterwards. Are there any risks or side effects? A barium enema is generally a very safe procedure, although there a few risks and side effects that you should be aware of. These include: laxative side effects \u2013 side effects such as feeling sick, a mild headache and bloating are common, but shouldn't last long barium side effects \u2013 barium is usually harmless, but it can cause an upset stomach or constipation, and it can cause an allergic reaction in very rare cases radiation exposure \u2013 you'll be exposed to a small amount of radiation during the test; this is about the equivalent to what you would receive naturally from the environment over three years (for more information, see GOV.UK: patient dose information) bowel perforation \u2013 there's a risk of a small hole developing in your bowel as a result of the procedure, but this is very rare Your doctor can help you weigh up the risks of the procedure against the benefits of identifying any problem in your bowel.

You may feel a soft, painless lump. This doesn't usually cause any problems. However, if the cyst grows very large, it can become noticeable and uncomfortable. You may feel pain in the skin surrounding the vagina (vulva) when you walk, sit down or have sex. The cyst can sometimes affect the outer pair of lips surrounding the vagina (labia majora). One side may look swollen or bigger than usual. If the cyst becomes infected, it can cause a painful collection of pus (abscess) to develop in one of the Bartholin's glands. Signs of an abscess include the affected area becoming red, swollen, tender and hot. It can also cause a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above. When to see your GP Small Bartholin's cysts are sometimes only found during a routine cervical screening test or an examination carried out for another reason. Always see your GP if you develop a lump in the area around your vagina so they can confirm a diagnosis and rule out more serious conditions. If your GP thinks the cyst or one of your Bartholin's glands may be infected, they may use a swab to remove a sample of discharge for analysis to identify the bacteria responsible. In some cases, your GP may recommend you have a biopsy. A small sample of cyst tissue will be removed and examined under a microscope to check for signs of a rare type of vulval cancer called Bartholin's gland cancer. What causes Bartholin's cysts? The Bartholin's glands are a pair of pea-sized glands found just behind and either side of the lips that surround the entrance to the vagina. The glands aren't usually noticeable because they're rarely larger than 1cm (0.4 inches) across. The Bartholin's glands secrete fluid that acts as a lubricant during sex. The fluid travels down tiny tubes called ducts, into the vagina. If the ducts become blocked, they can fill with fluid and expand to form a cyst. It's often not known why the ducts become blocked, but some cases are linked to sexually transmitted bacterial infections such as gonorrhoea or chlamydia, or other bacterial infections such as Escherichia coli (E. coli). How Bartholin's cysts are treated If you don't have any noticeable symptoms, it's unlikely you'll need treatment. If the cyst is painful, your GP may recommend some simple self care measures, such as soaking the cyst in warm water several times a day for three or four days and taking over-the-counter painkillers. If these don't work, several treatments are available to treat the pain and any infection. If necessary, the cyst can be drained. Most of these treatments involve a minor surgical procedure. It's estimated a Bartholin's cyst will return at a later stage in about one in every five women treated for the condition. Read more about treating a Bartholin's cyst. Who's affected? Around 1 in every 50 women will develop a Bartholin's cyst or abscess at some point. It usually affects sexually active women aged between 20 and 30. Bartholin's cysts don't usually affect children because the Bartholin's glands don't start functioning until puberty. The cysts are also uncommon after the menopause as this usually causes the Bartholin's glands to shrink. Preventing Bartholin's cysts It's not clear exactly why Bartholin's cysts develop, so it isn't usually possible to prevent them. However, as some are thought to be linked to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), practising safe sex (using a condom every time you have sex) can help reduce your chances of developing one.

Non-melanoma skin cancer refers to a group of cancers that slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin. The term 'non-melanoma' distinguishes these more common kinds of skin cancer from the less common skin cancer known as melanoma, which spreads faster in the body. The first sign of non-melanoma skin cancer is usually the appearance of a lump or patch on the skin that doesn't heal after a few weeks. In most cases, cancerous lumps are red and firm, while cancerous patches are often flat and scaly. See your GP if you have any skin abnormality that hasn't healed after four weeks. Although it is unlikely to be skin cancer, it is best to be sure. Read more about the symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer. Types of non-melanoma skin cancer Non-melanoma skin cancers usually develop in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis) and are often named after the type of skin cell from which they develop. The two most common types of non-melanoma skin cancer are: basal cell carcinoma \u2013 starts in the cells lining the bottom of the epidermis and accounts for about 75% of skin cancers squamous cell carcinoma \u2013 starts in the cells lining the top of the epidermis and accounts for about 20% of skin cancers Although not classed as non-melanoma skin cancers, actinic keratoses and Bowen's disease may sometimes develop into squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated. Why does it happen? Non-melanoma skin cancer is mainly caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light comes from the sun, as well as artificial sunbeds and sunlamps. In addition to UV light overexposure, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing non-melanoma skin cancer, such as: a family history of the condition pale skin that burns easily a large number of moles or freckles Read more about the causes of non-melanoma skin cancer. Who is affected? Non-melanoma skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. There are more than 100,000 new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer every year in the UK. Non-melanoma skin cancer affects slightly more men than women. Diagnosis Your GP can examine your skin for signs of skin cancer. They may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or a specialist plastic surgeon if they are unsure or suspect skin cancer. Your GP may refer you urgently, within two weeks, for squamous cell skin cancer. Basal cell skin cancers usually don't need an urgent referral but you should still see a specialist within 18 weeks. Read a guide to NHS waiting times. The specialist will examine your skin again and will perform a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of skin cancer. A biopsy is an operation that removes some affected skin so it can be studied under a microscope. Read more about diagnosing non-melanoma skin cancer. Treating non-melanoma skin cancer Surgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer. This involves removing the cancerous tumour and some of the surrounding skin. Other treatments for non-melanoma skin cancer include cryotherapy, creams, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and a treatment known as photodynamic therapy (PDT). Treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer is generally successful as, unlike most other types of cancer, there is a considerably lower risk that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body. It is estimated that basal cell carcinoma will spread to other parts of the body in less than 0.5% of cases. The risk is slightly higher in cases of squamous cell carcinoma, which spreads to other parts of the body in around 2-5% of cases. Treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer is completely successful in approximately 90% of cases. Read more about treating non-melanoma skin cancer. Complications If you have had non-melanoma skin cancer in the past, there is a chance the condition may return. The chance of non-melanoma skin cancer returning is increased if your previous cancer was widespread and severe. If your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your non-melanoma skin cancer returning, you will probably require regular check-ups to monitor your health. You will also be shown how to examine your skin to check for tumours. Prevention Non-melanoma skin cancer is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing the condition by avoiding overexposure to UV light. You can help protect yourself from sunburn by using sunscreen, dressing sensibly in the sun and limiting the time you spend in the sun during the hottest part of the day. Sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided. Regularly checking your skin for signs of skin cancer can help lead to an early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment.

TB is a serious infection which affects the lungs and sometimes other parts of the body, such as the bones, joints and kidneys. It can also cause meningitis. Read more about tuberculosis (TB). Who should have the BCG vaccine? The BCG vaccine (which stands for Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine) is not given as part of the routine NHS vaccination schedule. It's given on the NHS only when a child or adult is thought to have an increased risk of coming into contact with TB. BCG for babies BCG vaccination is recommended for babies who are born in areas where TB rates are higher than in the rest of the country, including some parts of inner London. BCG for children BCG vaccination may also be recommended for older children who have an increased risk of developing TB, such as: children who have recently arrived from countries with high levels of TB, including those in sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian sub-continent and parts of Eastern Europe children who have come into close contact with somebody infected with respiratory TB BCG for adults BCG vaccination is rarely given to anyone over the age of 16 \u2013 and never over the age of 35, because it doesn't work very well in adults. It is, however, given to adults aged 16 to 35 who are at risk of TB through their work, such as some healthcare workers. Read more about who should have the BCG vaccine. How is the BCG vaccination given? BCG vaccination is given as an injection into the upper arm. The vaccination usually leaves a small scar. Read more about potential BCG vaccination side effects. When is the BCG vaccination given? If it's advised that your baby has the BCG vaccine, the injection is usually offered soon after birth, while your baby is still in hospital. Alternatively, your baby can be referred to a local healthcare centre for vaccination after they've left hospital. This may not necessarily be the local GP surgery, as not all surgeries can provide this service. If you are offered BCG vaccination as an adult, it will be arranged by a local healthcare centre. How effective is BCG vaccination? The BCG vaccine is made from a weakened strain of TB bacteria. Because the bacteria in the vaccine is weak, it triggers the immune system to protect against the disease, giving good immunity to people who receive it, without actually causing the disease. The vaccine is 70-80% effective against the most severe forms of TB, such as TB meningitis in children. It is less effective in preventing respiratory disease, which is the more common form of TB in adults. Read more about the BCG vaccine.

They are caused when an area of skin is placed under pressure. They are sometimes known as \"bedsores\" or \"pressure sores\".   Pressure ulcers can range in severity from patches of discoloured skin to open wounds that expose the underlying bone or muscle. Read more about the symptoms of pressure ulcers. How pressure ulcers develop Pressure ulcers can develop when a large amount of pressure is applied to an area of skin over a short period of time. They can also occur when less pressure is applied over a longer period of time. The extra pressure disrupts the flow of blood through the skin. Without a blood supply, the affected skin becomes starved of oxygen and nutrients, and begins to break down, leading to an ulcer forming. Pressure ulcers tend to affect people with health conditions that make it difficult to move, especially those confined to lying in a bed or sitting for prolonged periods of time. Conditions that affect the flow of blood through the body, such as type 2 diabetes, can also make a person more vulnerable to pressure ulcers. Learn more about the causes of pressure ulcers. Who is affected? It's estimated that just under half a million people in the UK will develop at least one pressure ulcer in any given year. This is usually people with an underlying health condition \u2013 for example, around 1 in 20 people who are admitted to hospital with a sudden illness will develop a pressure ulcer. People over 70 years old are particularly vulnerable to pressure ulcers, as they are more likely to have mobility problems and ageing skin. Treating and preventing pressure ulcers Treatment for pressure ulcers includes the use of dressings, creams and gels designed to speed up the healing process and relieve pressure. Surgery is sometimes recommended for the most serious cases. For some people, pressure ulcers are an inconvenience that require minor nursing care. For others, they can be serious and lead to life-threatening complications, such as blood poisoning or gangrene.  Read more about the complications of pressure ulcers. Pressure ulcers can be unpleasant, upsetting and challenging to treat. Therefore, a range of techniques is used to prevent them developing in the first place. These include: regularly changing a person's position using equipment to protect vulnerable parts of the body \u2013 such as specially designed mattresses and cushions Read about treating pressure ulcers and preventing pressure ulcers for more information. Unfortunately, even with the highest standards of care, it's not always possible to prevent pressure ulcers in particularly vulnerable people.

Attracted by your body heat and carbon dioxide, they crawl out at night to bite your exposed skin and feed on your blood, just as mosquitoes do. Not everyone develops a skin reaction to bedbug bites, but some people develop itchy red bumps. These appear around 15 to 30 minutes after being bitten and can last for several days. Bedbug bites are usually found on the face, neck, hand or arm, and are often mistaken for mosquito bites. However, while mosquito bites tend to be random in pattern, bedbug bites more often occur in straight lines. Although bedbugs can be upsetting and stressful to find, they aren't dangerous and don't transmit any human diseases. Most people don't develop any serious skin reaction. However, you should take action straight away to prevent the spread of an infestation. If you think you have a bedbug infestation, read the advice below and contact your local council or a professional pest control firm that is a member of the British Pest Control Association or National Pest Technicians Association. About bedbugs Adult bedbugs look a bit like lentils and are visible to the naked eye. They are oval-shaped, flat and up to 5mm long. Their colour can vary between dark yellow, red or brown. Females lay up to 300 eggs over their lifetime. These white specks stick to surfaces and are very difficult to spot. They hatch after about 10 days to form tiny straw-coloured insects which take about six to eight weeks to grow into adults. As they grow, they shed their skin, which leaves mottled brown shells on your mattress. Bedbugs need to feed on blood to be able to mature, but they're very resilient. Adults can survive for up to a year without feeding. They're not attracted to dirt, so a bedbug infestation isn't a sign of an unclean home. Bedbugs may be found in all types of housing, but are more common in short-term accommodation such as hotels or hostels. How to spot them look for any unexplained skin rash or itchy bump (although not everyone develops this) look out for black spots on your mattress \u2013 this could be their dried faeces look for mottled shells that bedbugs may have shed check your sheets for blood spots where you may have rolled over and squashed a bug after it had fed inspect all the crevices and joints of your mattress and furniture using a torch, and see if you can spot any bugs there may be an unpleasant, musty scent in rooms with a large infestation \u2013 adult bedbugs produce this odour with their scent glands when disturbed Where to find them Because their bodies are flat, bedbugs can squeeze into the smallest crevice or crack, such as a mattress seam or the joints of a bed frame. This can make them very difficult to spot. They tend to prefer fabric or wood over plastic and metal, and often hide near to where you sleep \u2013 for example, under the mattress or along the headboard. However, they're able to travel several feet to reach you, so may be found away from the bed in other furniture, along the edges of carpets and even behind mirrors or inside smoke alarms. They can be found almost any place in the bedroom where they won't be disturbed. How bedbugs spread Once introduced into your home, bedbugs can spread easily from room to room. They don't jump or fly, but can crawl quickly. Bedbugs can soon spread within a building by getting through holes in walls or pipes, and can potentially invade blocks of flats, hotels or hospitals. On average, it takes around seven weeks before bedbugs are discovered in another room of a property. The bugs can also be transported in luggage, clothing, furniture and bedding from one building to the next. This makes it easy for tourists and commuters to unknowingly spread bedbugs. Getting rid of the bugs It can be extremely difficult to get rid of a bedbug infestation from your home, so it's wise to contact your local council or a pest control firm. Make sure any pest control company you contact is a member of the British Pest Control Association (check the credentials of the company first). Some councils' pest control services treat homes for free, whether you are a council tenant or not. Other councils' services are free for council tenants only. Each treatment can cost between about £20 and £170, depending on your council's pest control prices, how bad the infestation is and how many rooms are affected. Pest controllers can usually get rid of bedbugs with two treatments. A technician will carry out a thorough inspection, which may take a few hours. They will then use specially designed equipment such as insecticide, a steamer or rapid freeze system to get rid of the bugs. If you insist on tackling the bugs yourself, the following advice may help: if clothes or bedlinen have become infested, wash them at 60C, or put them in a dryer on a hot setting for 30 minutes to kill the bugs dismantle your bed and furniture, and closely inspect every seam, crevice and joint using a bright torch use a vacuum cleaner with a hose to suck up any bugs you can see, but bear in mind you may not be able to find them all \u2013 dispose of the contents of the vacuum cleaner in a sealed bag to kill any remaining bugs, use insecticide spray specially designed for bedbugs \u2013 always read the label and never use this directly on clothing, linen or your mattress be prepared to throw away a mattress if it appears to be heavily infested Insecticide sprays may be becoming less effective as the bugs build resistance to them. Ordinary insect repellent for mosquitoes and ticks don't seem to be effective. Preventing an infestation It can be difficult to avoid bedbugs, as they can be transported so easily and may not be noticed immediately. The best thing you can do is inspect your mattress regularly for common signs and take immediate action if necessary. Avoid buying second-hand mattresses and be wary of old beds you might be using in rented accommodation. Keeping your bedroom tidy and removing clutter, especially from the floor and under your bed, reduces the amount of hiding places for bedbugs. Treating bedbug bites As many people don't react to bedbug bites, or only have the odd spot, treatment may not be needed. If you develop very itchy bumps, your GP may prescribe some mild steroid cream to apply to your skin, or your pharmacist can recommend antihistamine tablets to relieve the itch. Your skin should clear up within a week. Read more about treatments for itching. A few people will develop a more severe rash of fluid-filled blisters.

The problem usually resolves in time. Bedwetting is common in young children but it gets less common as a child gets older. In the UK, it's estimated that about: 1 in 12 children wet the bed regularly at four and a half years old (regularly is defined as at least twice a week) 1 in 40 children wet the bed regularly at seven and a half years old 1 in 65 children wet the bed regularly at nine and a half years old About 1 in 100 people continue to wet the bed into adulthood. Bedwetting is slightly more common in boys than girls. When to see your GP Bedwetting is only really a problem if it begins to bother the children or parents. Only rarely will this be considered a problem in children under 5 years old. Many families first seek treatment when the bedwetting affects a child's social life (for example, preventing sleepovers). Medical treatments aren't usually recommended for children under five (although exceptions can be made if a child finds bedwetting particularly upsetting). If your child frequently wets the bed and finds it upsetting, speak to your GP for advice. Read more about the symptoms of bedwetting. Why does my child wet the bed?  There's usually no obvious reason why children wet the bed and it's not your child's fault. In many cases, the problem runs in families. Bedwetting could be caused by your child: producing more urine than their bladder can cope with having an overactive bladder, meaning it can only hold a small amount of urine being a very deep sleeper so they don't react to the signals telling their brain their bladder is full Constipation is frequently associated with bedwetting, especially in children who don't wet themselves every night. In these cases, bedwetting may happen during the night when the child has not had a poo during the day. Sometimes, treating constipation is all that's needed to treat bedwetting. Untreated constipation makes any treatment of bedwetting much harder. Occasionally, bedwetting can be triggered by emotional distress, such as being bullied or moving to a new school. In rare cases, bedwetting may be the symptom of an underlying health condition, such as type 1 diabetes. Read more about the causes of bedwetting and diagnosing bedwetting. Treating bedwetting The recommended plan is usually to try a few measures yourself first, such as limiting the amount of liquid your child drinks in the evening, and making sure they go to the toilet before going to sleep. Reassuring your child that everything is okay is also important. Don't tell them off or punish them for wetting the bed as this won't help and could make the problem worse. It's important for them to know they're not alone, and it will get better. If these measures alone don't help, a bedwetting alarm is often recommended. These are moisture-sensitive pads a child wears on their night clothes. An alarm sounds if the child begins to pee. Over time, the alarm should help train a child to wake once their bladder is full. If an alarm doesn't work or is unsuitable, medication called desmopressin or oxybutinin can be used.  Most children respond well to treatment, although bedwetting sometimes returns temporarily. Read more about treating bedwetting. ERIC Education and Resources for Improving Childhood Continence (ERIC) is a UK-based charity for people affected by bedwetting. The charity\u2019s website provides useful information and advice for both children and parents. ERIC also has a telephone helpline \u2013 0845 370 8008, open weekdays from 10am to 4pm. Bedwetting in adults About 1 in 100 people continue to wet the bed into adulthood, and some people only begin to wet the bed as an adult. This usually requires referral to a specialist such as an urologist (a specialist in treating conditions that affect the urinary system) or an incontinence adviser. Read more about urinary incontinence, bedwetting in adults and bedwetting in teenagers.

But occasionally they can become infected, cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or spread serious illnesses such as Lyme disease and malaria. Bugs that bite or sting include wasps, hornets, bees, horseflies, ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, spiders and midges. This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you've been bitten or stung When to get medical advice When to get emergency medical help Prevention Symptoms of insect bites and stings Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Some people have a mild allergic reaction and a larger area of skin around the bite or sting becomes swollen, red and painful. This should pass within a week. Occasionally, a severe allergic reaction can occur, causing symptoms such as breathing difficulties, dizziness and a swollen face or mouth. This requires immediate medical treatment (see below). Read more about the symptoms of common insect bites and stings. What to do if you've been bitten or stung To treat an insect bite or sting: Remove the sting or tick if it's still in the skin (see treating insect bites and stings for advice about how to do this safely). Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they're unlikely to help. The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. Ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments that can help, such as painkillers, creams for itching and antihistamines. Read more about treatments for insect bites and stings. When to get medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if: you're worried about a bite or sting your symptoms don't start to improve within a few days or are getting worse you've been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes a large area (around 10cm or more) around the bite becomes red and swollen you have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness you have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a fever, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms When to get emergency medical help Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe reaction, such as: wheezing or difficulty breathing a swollen face, mouth or throat nausea or vomiting a fast heart rate dizziness or feeling faint difficulty swallowing loss of consciousness Emergency treatment in hospital is needed in these cases. Prevent insect bites and stings There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin \u2013 repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants \u2013 these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. You may need to take extra precautions if you're travelling to part of the world where there's a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about how to prevent insect bites and stings.

It is sometimes referred to as an autoinflammatory disease, as certain cells of the immune system may begin this inflammation when triggered. It is also known as Behçet's syndrome. Signs and symptoms The inflammation associated with Behçet's disease can affect blood vessels located within tissues throughout the body. It can therefore cause a wide range of symptoms. Common symptoms include: genital and mouth ulcers red, painful eyes and blurred vision acne-like spots headaches painful, stiff and swollen joints In severe causes, there is also a risk of serious and potentially life-threatening problems, such as permanent vision loss and strokes. Read more about the symptoms of Behçet's disease. Seeking medical advice You should see your GP if you have a collection of persistent symptoms of Behçet's disease. Confirming a diagnosis of Behçet's disease can be difficult because the symptoms are wide ranging and are shared with a number of other conditions. A diagnosis will usually need to be made by a specialist based on your symptoms and by ruling out other conditions. Read more about diagnosing Behçet's disease.  What causes Behçet's disease? The cause of Behçet's disease is unknown, although most experts believe it is an autoinflammatory condition. An autoinflammatory condition is where the immune system \u2013 the body's natural defence against infection and illness \u2013 mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In cases of Behçet's disease, it is thought the immune system mistakenly attacks the blood vessels. It's not clear what triggers this problem with the immune system, but it is very likely that both genes and environmental factors play a role. Read more about the causes of Behçet's disease. Who is affected? Behçet's disease tends to be more common in the Far East, the Middle East and Mediterranean countries such as Turkey, Iran and Israel. It is much rarer in the UK, affecting an estimated 1,000 people in total. People of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and Asian origin are thought to be most at risk of developing the condition, although it can affect all ethnic groups. The symptoms of Behçet's disease can begin at any age, although they usually first appear when a person is between 20 and 30 years of age, and less commonly start after the age of 50. How Behçet's disease is treated There is no cure for Behçet's disease, but it is often possible to control the symptoms with medicines that reduce the inflammation in the affected parts of the body. These medications include: corticosteroids \u2013 powerful anti-inflammatory medications immunosuppressants \u2013 medications that reduce the activity of the immune system biological therapies \u2013 medications that target the biological processes involved in the process of inflammation Your healthcare team will create a specific treatment plan for you depending on your symptoms. Read more about treating Behçet's disease. Outlook Behçet's disease is highly unpredictable. Most people with the condition will experience episodes where their symptoms are severe (flare-ups or relapses), followed by periods where the symptoms disappear (remission). As yet, no triggers have been identified that cause a flare-up of symptoms. Over time, some of the symptoms can settle down and become less troublesome, although they may never resolve completely. In the most serious cases, inflammation of the eyes can lead to vision loss. However, modern treatments can help reduce this risk when started early. Inflammation of the nervous system, veins and arteries or heart can be life threatening, but because of the standard of care in UK, deaths from Behçet's disease are rare. Information about you If you have Behçet's disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

It is the most common cause of facial paralysis. Other causes of facial paralysis include: congenital facial palsy \u2013 children born with facial weakness injury to the facial nerve in an accident \u2013 such as a cut to the cheek or skull base fracture injury from surgery \u2013 which is most common during surgery of the parotid gland and neck What are the symptoms? The symptoms of Bell\u2019s palsy vary from person to person. The weakness on one side of the face can be described as either: partial palsy, which is mild muscle weakness complete palsy, which is no movement at all (paralysis) \u2013 although this is very rare Bell's palsy can also affect the eyelid and mouth, making it difficult to close and open them. In rare cases, it can affect both sides of a person\u2019s face. Read more about the symptoms of Bell's palsy When to seek medical advice As well as being a symptom of Bell's palsy, facial weakness or paralysis can also be a sign of a more serious condition \u2013 such as a stroke. Visit your nearest A&E department immediately or call 999 for an ambulance if you or someone you are with develops sudden facial paralysis, so a doctor can determine the cause. Bell's palsy is only diagnosed if other possible causes of your symptoms are ruled out. Read more about diagnosing Bell's palsy. Why does it happen? Bell's palsy is believed to occur when the nerve that controls the muscles in your face becomes compressed. The exact cause is unknown, although it's thought to be because the facial nerve becomes inflamed, possibly due to a viral infection.  The herpes virus is thought to be the most common cause but other viruses may also be responsible. Read more about the causes of Bell's palsy Who is affected? Bell's palsy is a rare condition that affects about one in 5,000 people a year. It's most common in people aged 15-60, but people outside this age group can also suffer from the condition. Both men and women are affected equally. Bell's palsy is more common in pregnant women and those with diabetes and HIV, for reasons that are not yet fully understood. Treating Bell's palsy Around seven out of 10 people with Bell's palsy make a complete recovery, with or without treatment. Most people notice an improvement in their symptoms after about two to three weeks but a complete recovery can take up to nine months. The recovery time varies from person to person and will depend on the amount of nerve damage. Prednisolone, a type of corticosteroid, is used to reduce the swelling of the facial nerve. Eye drops may be required to prevent problems if you are unable to close your eye. Tape may also be used to close the eye while sleeping. Read more about treatments for Bell's palsy. Complications Around three in 10 people with Bell\u2019s palsy will continue to experience weakness in their facial muscles, and two in 10 will be left with a more serious long-term problem. Complications include: persistent facial weakness eye problems difficulty with speech, eating and drinking reduced sense of taste facial muscle twitching Bell's palsy may reoccur in up to 14% of people, especially if there is a family history of the condition.

If the pain is persistent and you haven't accidentally bitten or burnt your tongue, see your GP or dentist. There may be an underlying problem that needs treating, and your GP or dentist may be able to advise you about pain relief while you wait for it to get better. This page outlines the most likely causes of tongue pain, but you shouldn't use it to diagnose yourself with a condition \u2013 always leave that to a healthcare professional. Common causes Common causes of tongue pain are outlined below. Geographic tongue Also known as benign migratory glossitis or oral erythema migrans, geographic tongue is a common condition that causes irregular red patches surrounded by white lines to develop on the tongue, giving it a map-like appearance. In some people, the red patches may feel sore or sensitive to certain foods and drinks. You may notice that after a few days, weeks or months the position of these lines and patches change. They may disappear and re-appear later on a different part of the tongue. Some people find the condition improves over time, while for others it may be persistent. See your GP or dentist if you have persistent discoloured or painful patches on your tongue. It\u2019s not clear exactly what causes geographic tongue and there is no specific treatment for it, but you may be able to manage the pain by taking over-the-counter painkillers (speak to your pharmacist for advice) and avoiding anything that makes it worse, such as acidic, spicy or hot foods. Oral thrush Oral thrush is an infection in the mouth caused by a fungus, which can cause a coated or white tongue and areas of soreness. You are more likely to develop oral thrush if you: have recently taken antibiotics have poor oral hygiene wear dentures (false teeth), particularly if they don't fit properly have a weakened immune system have diabetes You should see your GP if you think you have oral thrush. If it is left untreated, the symptoms will persist and your mouth will continue to be uncomfortable. Oral thrush is treated with antifungal medicines taken for around a week. These usually come in the form of gels or liquid that you apply directly inside your mouth, although tablets or capsules are sometimes used. Aphthous mouth ulcers Aphthous mouth ulcers are painful sores that can occur anywhere within the mouth and are common on the underside of the tongue. Many mouth ulcers are caused by damage to the mouth, such as from accidentally biting your tongue or eating something hard and sharp. Ulcers that keep recurring have been linked to things such as stress, anxiety, hormone changes, certain foods and stopping smoking. Read more about the causes of mouth ulcers. Most mouth ulcers heal within a week or two and you may be able to manage the pain in the meantime by taking over-the-counter painkillers and avoiding anything that worsens it, such as spicy foods. See your GP or dentist if you have an ulcer that doesn\u2019t improve within a few weeks or if you develop ulcers regularly. Less common causes Less commonly, tongue pain may be caused by: a viral infection \u2013 such as an infection by viruses that cause hand, foot and mouth disease or cold sores vitamin deficiencies and anaemia \u2013 a sore tongue can sometimes be a symptom of iron deficiency anaemia and vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia median rhomboid glossitis \u2013 where a smooth, red, inflamed patch develops on the middle or back of the tongue, thought to result from a fungal infection glossodynia or \"burning mouth syndrome\" \u2013 a burning pain on the tip of the tongue that is often seen in people with depression glossopharyngeal neuralgia \u2013 repeated episodes of severe tongue pain believed to be caused by nerve irritation lichen planus \u2013 a long-term skin condition that causes an itchy rash and can also affect the mouth, causing a white lacy pattern and painful patches on the tongue Behçet's disease \u2013 a rare condition that causes inflammation of the blood vessels and can also lead to painful mouth ulcers  pemphigus vulgaris \u2013 a rare and serious condition that causes painful blisters to develop on the skin, as well as inside the mouth, nose, throat, anus and genitals medications \u2013 painful mouth ulcers can be a side effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and beta-blockers, and certain mouthwashes can cause tongue pain in some people Moeller's glossitis \u2013 a type of inflammation of the tongue cancer of the tongue \u2013 although this is rare Click on the above links for more information about these conditions and medications.

It's particularly common in men over 50 years of age and isn't usually a serious threat to health. Prostate gland The prostate is a small gland found only in men, located in the pelvis, between the penis and bladder. It's involved in the production of semen. The prostate produces a thick, white fluid that's made into a thinner liquid by a protein called prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The liquid is then mixed with sperm, produced by the testicles, to create semen. If the prostate becomes enlarged, it can place pressure on the bladder and urethra (the tube through which urine passes). This can affect how you pass urine and may cause: difficulty starting urination a frequent need to urinate difficulty fully emptying the bladder In some men, the symptoms are mild and don't require treatment. In others, the symptoms can be very troublesome and have a major impact on a person's quality of life. Read more about the symptoms of benign prostate enlargement. Many men worry that having an enlarged prostate means they have an increased risk of developing prostate cancer. This isn't the case. The risk of prostate cancer is no greater for men with an enlarged prostate than it is for men without an enlarged prostate. What causes benign prostate enlargement? The cause of prostate enlargement is unknown, but most experts agree that it's linked to hormonal changes that occur as a man gets older. Read more about the causes of benign prostate enlargement. How is benign prostate enlargement diagnosed? If your GP suspects that you have an enlarged prostate, you'll be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess your symptoms. Each question has five possible answers that carry a score, and your overall score indicates the severity of your symptoms. Your GP will also want to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms to prostate enlargement.  You may have a number of standard tests, such as urine tests, plus some more specific tests, such as a blood test that measures PSA. Read more about diagnosing benign prostate enlargement. Treating benign prostate enlargement Treatment for an enlarged prostate is determined by the severity of your symptoms. If you have mild to moderate symptoms, you won't receive any immediate medical treatment, but you'll have regular check-ups to carefully monitor your prostate. You'll probably also be advised to make lifestyle changes, such as limiting your caffeine and alcohol intake, and exercising regularly, to see if they improve your symptoms. As well as lifestyle changes, medication is usually recommended to treat moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement. Finasteride and dutasteride are medications that are commonly used. They block the effects of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the prostate gland, which can reduce the size of the prostate and improve associated symptoms. Alpha blockers may also be prescribed. They help to relax your bladder muscles, making it easier to pass urine. Tamsulosin and alfuzosin are two alpha blockers commonly used to treat benign prostate enlargement. Surgery is usually only recommended for moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement that have failed to respond to medication. Read more about treating benign prostate enlargement. Complications of benign prostate enlargement Benign prostate enlargement can sometimes lead to complications such as a urinary tract infection (UTI) or acute urinary retention. Serious complications are rare. Read more about the complications of benign prostate enlargement. How common is benign prostate enlargement? Benign prostate enlargement is a condition associated with ageing and is common in men over 50 years of age. Around 4 out of 10 men (40%) over 50, and 3 out of 4 men (75%) in their 70s have urinary symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate.

On this page, you can read about what the prostate is and the main problems that affect it, which are: prostate enlargement prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) prostate cancer Below is a summary of these conditions, plus links to more detailed information about them. About the prostate gland The prostate is a small gland found only in men. It surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). It sits just below the bladder and the opening of the vas deferens (tube that carries sperm up from the testicles to the urethra). The prostate gland produces a thick, white fluid that's mixed with sperm to create semen. The prostate gland is about the size and shape of a walnut, but tends to get bigger as you get older. It can sometimes become swollen or enlarged because of medical conditions such as those outlined below. Prostate enlargement Prostate enlargement is a very common condition associated with ageing. Over a third of all men over 50 years of age will have some symptoms of prostate enlargement. It's not known why the prostate gets bigger as you get older, but it isn't caused by cancer and it doesn't increase your risk of developing prostate cancer. An enlarged prostate can put pressure on the urethra (see above), which can affect how you urinate. Signs of an enlarged prostate can include: difficulty starting or stopping urinating a weak flow of urine straining when peeing feeling like you're not able to fully empty your bladder prolonged dribbling after you've finished peeing needing to pee more frequently or more suddenly waking up frequently during the night to pee  See your GP if you notice any problems with, or changes to, your usual pattern of urination. Simple measures such as reducing the amount you drink (especially tea, coffee and alcohol) before bed can sometimes help control the symptoms. Medication can help reduce the size of your prostate and relax the muscles of your bladder. In severe cases that don't get better with medication, the inner part of the prostate can be surgically removed. Read more about prostate enlargement. Prostatitis Prostatitis is where the prostate gland becomes inflamed (swollen). It's sometimes caused by a bacterial infection, although more often no infection can be found and it's not clear why it happened. Unlike prostate enlargement or prostate cancer \u2013 which usually affect older men \u2013 prostatitis can develop in men of all ages. However, it's generally more common in men between 30 and 50 years of age. Symptoms of prostatitis can include: pain in the pelvis, genitals, lower back and buttocks pain when urinating a frequent need to pee difficulty urinating, such as problems starting to pee pain when ejaculating pain in the perineum (the area between the anus and scrotum), which is often made worse by prolonged sitting See your GP if you have these symptoms. Prostatitis can be treated using a combination of painkillers and a type of medication known as an alpha-blocker, which can help to relax the muscles of the prostate and bladder neck. Medication that shrinks the prostate gland may also be helpful. Most men will recover within a few weeks or months, although some will continue to have symptoms for longer. Read more about prostatitis. Prostate cancer In the UK, prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men, with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. It's not clear why it occurs, but your chances of developing prostate cancer increase as you get older. The condition mainly affects men over 65, although men over 50 are also at risk. The risk of developing prostate cancer is also increased in men who have a first-degree relative (dad or brother) with prostate cancer and in men of Afro-Caribbean origin. The symptoms of prostate cancer can be difficult to distinguish from those of prostate enlargement (see above). They may include: needing to pee more frequently (often during the night) needing to rush to the toilet difficulty starting to urinate straining or taking a long time while peeing weak flow  a feeling that your bladder hasn't emptied fully You should see your GP if you have these symptoms. It's much more likely to be prostate enlargement, but it\u2019s important to rule out cancer. The outlook for prostate cancer is generally good because, unlike many other types of cancer, it usually progresses very slowly. Many men die with prostate cancer, rather than as a result of having it. Prostate cancer therefore doesn\u2019t always need to be treated immediately. Sometimes it may just be monitored at first and only treated if it gets worse. Read more about prostate cancer.

Beta-blockers are prescription-only medicines (POMS), which means they can only be prescribed by a GP or another suitably qualified healthcare professional. Examples of commonly used beta-blockers include: atenolol (Tenormin) bisoprolol (Cardicor, Emcor) carvedilol  metoprolol (Betaloc, Lopresor) nebivolol (Nebilet) propranolol (Inderal) This topic covers: Uses Who can take beta-blockers Interactions with other medicines Side effects Missed or extra doses Uses for beta-blockers Beta-blockers may be used to treat: angina \u2013 chest pain caused by narrowing of the arteries supplying the heart  heart failure \u2013 failure of the heart to pump enough blood around the body  atrial fibrillation \u2013 irregular heartbeat  heart attack \u2013 an emergency where the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked high blood pressure \u2013 when other medicines have been tried, or in addition to other medicines Less commonly, beta-blockers are used to prevent migraine or treat: an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) anxiety conditions tremor  glaucoma \u2013 as eye drops  There are several types of beta-blocker, and each one has its own characteristics. The type prescribed for you will depend on your condition. Who can take beta-blockers Before taking beta-blockers, make sure your doctor is aware of any other conditions you have, as they may not be suitable to use. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have a history of: asthma or any type of lung disease heart disease  kidney disease  diabetes \u2013 particularly if you have frequent episodes of low blood sugar allergic reaction to any medication Your GP can advise you about which medicine to use if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. It's important not to stop taking beta-blockers without seeking your GP's advice. In some cases suddenly stopping the medicine may make your condition worse. Interactions with other medicines Beta-blockers, including beta-blocker eye drops, can interact with other medicines, altering the effects of one of the medicines. Read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine to check that it's safe to take with beta-blockers. If you're still unsure, you could also ask your GP or pharmacist. Some of the more common medicines that can interact with beta-blockers include: anti-arrhythmics \u2013 used to control irregular heartbeats antihypertensives \u2013 used to lower blood pressure antipsychotics \u2013 used to treat severe mental health problems clonidine \u2013 used to treat high blood pressure and migraine mefloquine \u2013 used to treat or prevent malaria Side effects of beta-blockers Most people taking beta-blockers have either no or very mild side effects that become less troublesome with time. Contact your GP if you're experiencing symptoms that affect your everyday life. They can discuss whether the symptoms are a result of the medication and what to do.  Don't drive if you feel dizzy, tired, or your vision is affected. Symptoms commonly reported both by people taking beta-blockers and those taking a dummy medication (placebo) include: dizziness tiredness blurred vision cold hands and feet slow heartbeat diarrhoea and nausea Less common symptoms include: sleep disturbance (insomnia) loss of sex drive (libido) depression  problems getting or maintaining an erection (impotence) If you feel unwell after taking beta-blockers or have concerns, speak to your GP or pharmacist, or call NHS 111. You can also report suspected side effects using the Yellow Card Scheme. Missed or extra doses Contact your GP or call NHS 111 if you accidentally take one or more extra doses of beta-blockers. They'll be able to advise you about what to do. Most beta-blockers are taken once a day, apart from certain beta-blockers that are used during pregnancy and Sotalol, which is given two or three times a day. If you forget to take a dose of your beta-blocker, you should check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. It should include advice about what to do in this situation. Never double up on a dose to make up for a missed or forgotten dose of any beta-blocker.  Your GP or pharmacist can also give you further advice.

The bile duct system, or \"biliary\" system, is made up of a series of tubes that begin in the liver and end in the small intestine. Bile is a fluid the digestive system uses to help break down fats and digest foods. Symptoms of bile duct cancer In most cases, there are no signs of bile duct cancer until it reaches the later stages, when symptoms can include: jaundice \u2013 yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, itchy skin, pale stools and dark-coloured urine  unintentional weight loss abdominal pain See your GP if you have signs of jaundice or are worried about other symptoms. While it is unlikely you have bile duct cancer, it is best to get it checked. Read more about the symptoms of bile duct cancer. Why does bile duct cancer happen? The exact cause of bile duct cancer is unknown. However, some things may increase your chances of developing the condition. The most common include being over 65 years old or having a rare chronic liver disease called primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Read more about the causes of bile duct cancer. Types of bile duct cancer There are two main types of bile duct cancer, depending on where the cancer begins: cancer that starts in a part of the bile duct inside the liver is known as intrahepatic bile duct cancer cancer that starts in part of the bile duct outside the liver is known as extrahepatic bile duct cancer Diagnosis Cancer of the bile duct can be difficult to diagnose, so you may need several tests, including:  blood tests ultrasound scans computerised tomography (CT) scans magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans For some of these tests, you may need to be injected with a special dye that highlights your bile ducts. You may also need a biopsy. This involves removing a small sample of tissue so it can be studied under a microscope. However, in some cases, your surgeon may prefer to remove the suspected tumour based on the results of your scans alone. Read more about diagnosing bile duct cancer. How is bile duct cancer treated? Cancer of the bile duct can usually only be cured if cancerous cells haven't spread. If this is the case, some or all of the bile duct may be removed. Only a small proportion of bile duct cancer cases are diagnosed early enough to be suitable for surgery. This is because symptoms usually develop at a late stage. Despite this, treatment such as chemotherapy can relieve the symptoms of bile duct cancer and improve the quality of life of people in the advanced stages of the condition. Read more about treating bile duct cancer.   Who is affected? Less than 2,000 people are diagnosed with bile duct cancer each year in Great Britain. However, studies suggest that cases of bile duct cancer are increasing in most countries. The reasons for this are unknown. Most cases of bile duct cancer occur in people over the age of 65. The condition affects men and women almost equally. Can bile duct cancer be prevented? There are no guaranteed ways to avoid getting bile duct cancer, but you can reduce your chances of developing it. The most effective ways of achieving this are reducing your alcohol intake, as cirrhosis is a risk factor, and trying to ensure that you don't become infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

The parasite is most commonly found throughout Africa, but also lives in parts of South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Asia. The Travel Health Pro website has a map of where schistosomiasis is found. You often don't have any symptoms when you first become infected with schistosomiasis, but the parasite can remain in the body for many years and cause damage to organs such as the bladder, kidneys and liver. The infection can be easily treated with a short course of medicine, so see your GP if you think you might have it. This page covers: How you get schistosomiasis Symptoms of schistosomiasis Long-term problems caused by schistosomiasis When to seek medical advice Treatments for schistosomiasis Preventing schistosomiasis How you get schistosomiasis The worms that cause schistosomiasis live in fresh water, such as: ponds lakes rivers reservoirs canals Showers that take unfiltered water directly from lakes or rivers may also spread the infection, but the worms aren't found in the sea, chlorinated swimming pools or properly treated water supplies. You can become infected if you come into contact with contaminated water \u2013 for example, when paddling, swimming or washing \u2013 and the tiny worms burrow into your skin. Once in your body, the worms move through your blood to areas such as the liver and bowel. After a few weeks, the worms start to lay eggs. Some eggs remain inside the body and are attacked by the immune system, while some are passed out in the person's urine or poo. Without treatment, the worms can keep laying eggs for several years. If the eggs pass out of the body into water, they release tiny larvae that need to grow inside freshwater snails for a few weeks before they're able to infect another person. This means it's not possible to catch the infection from someone else who has it. Symptoms of schistosomiasis Many people with schistosomiasis don't have any symptoms, or don't experience any for several months or even years. You probably won't notice that you've been infected, although occasionally people get small, itchy red bumps on their skin for a few days where the worms burrowed in. After a few weeks, some people develop: a high temperature (fever) above 38C (100.4F) an itchy, red, blotchy and raised rash a cough diarrhoea muscle and joint pain abdominal (tummy) pain a general sense of feeling unwell These symptoms, known as acute schistosomiasis, often get better by themselves within a few weeks. But it's still important to get treated because the parasite can remain in your body and lead to long-term problems (see below). Long-term problems caused by schistosomiasis Some people with schistosomiasis, regardless of whether they had any initial symptoms or not, eventually develop more serious problems in parts of the body the eggs have travelled to. This is known as chronic schistosomiasis. Chronic schistosomiasis can include a range of symptoms and problems, depending on the exact area that's infected. For example, an infection in the: digestive system can cause anaemia, abdominal pain and swelling, diarrhoea and blood in your poo urinary system can cause irritation of the bladder (cystitis), pain when peeing, a frequent need to pee, and blood in your urine heart and lungs can cause a persistent cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and coughing up blood nervous system or brain can cause seizures (fits), headaches, weakness and numbness in your legs, and dizziness Without treatment, affected organs can become permanently damaged. When to seek medical advice Visit your GP if you develop the symptoms above and you've travelled in parts of the world where schistosomiasis is found, or if you're concerned that you may have been exposed to the parasites while travelling. Tell your GP about your travel history and whether you think you may have been exposed to potentially contaminated water. If your GP suspects schistosomiasis, they may refer you to an expert in tropical diseases. The diagnosis is usually made by testing a sample of your blood. In some cases, eggs may be seen in a sample or your urine or poo. Treatments for schistosomiasis Schistosomiasis can usually be treated successfully with a short course of a medication called praziquantel, that kills the worms. Praziquantel is most effective once the worms have grown a bit, so treatment may be delayed until eight weeks after you were infected, or repeated again after this time. Steroid medication can also be used to help relieve the symptoms of acute schistosomiasis, or symptoms caused by damage to the brain or nervous system. Preventing schistosomiasis There's no vaccine for schistosomiasis, so it's important to be aware of the risks and take precautions to avoid exposure to contaminated water. You can check whether the area you're visiting is known to have a problem with schistosomiasis using Travel Health Pro's country information section. If you're visiting one of these areas: avoid paddling, swimming and washing in fresh water \u2013 only swim in the sea or chlorinated swimming pools take waterproof trousers and boots with you if there's a chance you'll need to cross a stream or river boil or filter water before drinking \u2013 as the parasites could burrow into your lips or mouth if you drink contaminated water avoid medicines sold locally that are advertised to treat or prevent schistosomiasis \u2013 these are often either fake, substandard, ineffective or not given at the correct dosage don't rely on assurances from hotels, tourist boards or similar that a particular stretch of water is safe \u2013 there have been reports of some organisations downplaying the risks Applying insect repellent to your skin or quickly drying yourself with a towel after getting out of the water aren't reliable ways of preventing infection, although it's a good idea to dry yourself as soon as possible if you're accidentally exposed to potentially contaminated water. There's some evidence that applying insect repellent containing 50% DEET to exposed areas each night after showering kills the parasite in the skin before it moves deeper into the body.

People who binge eat consume very large quantities of food over a short period of time, even when they are not hungry. Binges are often planned in advance and can involve the person buying \"special\" binge foods. In rare cases, people describe themselves as being in a \"dazed state\" during a binge \u2013 particularly binges during the night \u2013 and they are not able to recall what they ate. People who binge eat feel they have no control over their eating. They often binge in private because they feel embarrassed, guilty or disgusted with their behaviour after they have finished eating. Episodes of binge eating sometimes alternate with periods where the person cuts down on the amount of food they eat. This can lead to a vicious cycle that is difficult to break \u2013 where blood sugar levels rise and fall rapidly, and false messages are sent to the brain, which result in cravings for food when your body doesn't need it. Who is affected Anyone can be affected by binge eating. While the condition is slightly more common in women than men, the numbers of men and women affected are more equal than in other eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa. The condition tends to first develop in young adults, although many people do not seek help until they are in their 30s or 40s. It\u2019s estimated that there is around a 1 in 30 to 1 in 50 chance of a person developing binge eating disorder at some point during their life. Getting help Many people will occasionally binge on food \u2013 this doesn't necessarily mean you have a binge eating disorder. However, you should see your GP if you binge regularly and excessively, particularly if the binges are having an effect on your physical and\/or mental health. Your GP can diagnose the condition and may be able to refer you to a specialist, such as a psychiatrist or a psychologist. Your GP will ask you about your eating habits and look for the following signs: you eat much faster than normal during a binge you eat until you feel uncomfortably full you eat a large amount of food when you are not hungry you eat alone or secretly due to being embarrassed about the amount of food you are consuming you have feelings of guilt, shame or disgust after binge eating People who regularly eat this way are likely to have a binge eating disorder. What causes binge eating? It's not clear what causes binge eating, but, like most eating disorders, it's seen as a way of coping with feelings of unhappiness and low self-esteem. Things that may increase your risk of developing problems with binge eating include: low self-esteem and a lack of confidence depression or anxiety feelings of stress, anger, boredom or loneliness dissatisfaction with your body and feeling under pressure to be thin stressful or traumatic events in your past a family history of eating disorders, which may be related to your genes differences in your brain or the level of hormones produced by your brain compared to people who don't binge eat Binge eating can sometimes develop following a strict diet, particularly if you skipped meals, cut certain foods out and didn't eat enough food. These are unhealthy ways to lose weight and may mean you're more likely to binge at another time.   How binge eating is treated Binge eating is treatable and most people eventually get better with appropriate help and support. The main treatments are: self-help programmes \u2013 this may be individually with a book or online course, or as part of a self-help support group guided self-help (self-help supervised by regular contacts with a professional) specialist group intervention individual (one-to-one) psychological therapy \u2013 such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) medication called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) These treatments can help you overcome the psychological issues associated with your binge eating, but they won't usually have a significant impact on your weight. If you are overweight, a healthcare professional may also draw up a weight loss plan to follow during treatment or after any psychological issues have been dealt with. Read more about treating binge eating. Risks of binge eating Binge eating can be associated with serious psychological problems, including depression and anxiety disorders. These feelings can be made worse over time while the person is still binge eating. A common physical effect of binge eating is weight gain, which can lead to obesity. This can put you at risk of a number of related physical health problems, some of which can be life-threatening. These include: high cholesterol and high blood pressure \u2013 which can increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease and stroke diabetes \u2013 a long-term condition that causes your blood sugar level to become too high osteoarthritis \u2013 a condition that causes pain and swelling in the joints some types of cancer \u2013 such as breast cancer and bowel cancer Therefore, it's important to seek help if you think you may have a binge eating problem, because you may need support to help you tackle both your psychological and physical problems. Binge eating and bulimia Although binge eating is similar to another eating disorder called bulimia, the two conditions are different. In people with bulimia, periods of binge eating are followed by attempts to purge (flush out) the food they have eaten \u2013 for example, by making themselves vomit or by taking laxatives. People who binge eat do not purge themselves to control their weight, but may try to limit weight gain by having periods of eating very little between binges.

A tissue sample can be taken from almost anywhere on or in your body, including the skin, organs and other structures. The term \"biopsy\" is often used to refer to both the act of taking the sample and the tissue sample itself. When a biopsy may be needed A biopsy can be used to investigate abnormalities, which can be: functional \u2013 such as kidney or liver problems structural \u2013 such as swelling in a particular organ When the tissue sample is examined under the microscope, abnormal cells may be identified, which can help to diagnose a specific condition. If a condition has already been diagnosed, a biopsy can also be used to assess its severity (such as the degree of inflammation) and grade (such as the aggressiveness of a cancer). This information can be very useful when deciding on the most appropriate treatment, and assessing how well a person responds to a particular type of treatment. It can also be useful in helping to determine a person's overall prognosis (outlook). Examples of conditions where a biopsy may be helpful include: cancer inflammation, such as in the liver (hepatitis) or kidney (nephritis) infection, such as in lymph nodes \u2013 for example, tuberculosis various skin conditions It's not usually possible to tell whether a lump or growth on your skin or inside your body is cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign) by clinical examination alone, which is why a biopsy is often required. Types of biopsy There are various types of biopsy that can be used to help identify a wide range of health conditions. Types of biopsy include:  a punch biopsy \u2013 a special instrument punches a small hole in the skin to obtain a skin sample, to investigate a skin condition a needle biopsy \u2013 a special hollow needle, guided by X-ray, ultrasound, CT scan or MRI scan, is used to obtain tissue from an organ or from tissue underneath the skin an endoscopic biopsy \u2013 an endoscope is used to remove tissue, such as from the stomach during a gastroscopy an excision biopsy \u2013 surgery is used to remove a larger section of tissue perioperative biopsy \u2013 if consent has been given, a perioperative biopsy can be carried out during surgery; in certain circumstances, the sample may be tested straight away to help guide the surgery or further treatment How a biopsy is carried out will depend on where the tissue sample is being taken from. Before the procedure, CT or MRI scanning is often used as a guide to help with this decision. After the tissue sample is taken, it will be examined under a microscope to help identify the nature of the problem. This often means that a definite diagnosis can be made. The type of stains and tests that are used when the tissue is examined under the microscope will depend on the medical condition being investigated. Recovery Most biopsies will only require local anaesthetic, which means you won't need to stay in hospital overnight. However, an overnight stay is usually required when the procedure is carried out under general anaesthetic. Most types of biopsy are painless once the anaesthetic starts to work, although this depends on where the sample is taken. You may experience a dull ache, which can be treated with painkillers on the advice of your doctor or surgeon. Some types of biopsy may involve staying in hospital for a few hours. You may need to have stitches or a dressing applied before you leave. Read more about recovering from a biopsy. Getting your results How quickly you get the results of a biopsy will depend on the urgency of your case and your local hospital's policy. Results are often available within a few days. However, this is difficult to predict, because further tests may be needed after the first examination of the sample. It's sometimes necessary to send the microscope slides away, to get another specialist opinion. If a biopsy is carried out during surgery, in some cases a different processing method may be used, known as a \"frozen section\". This enables the surgeon to get a preliminary result, which can be used to help guide treatment while it's in progress. Your GP, hospital consultant or practice nurse will give you your results and explain what they mean. A biopsy is sometimes inconclusive, which means it hasn't produced a definitive result. In this case, the biopsy may need to be repeated, or other tests may be required to confirm your diagnosis.

People with bipolar disorder have periods or episodes of: depression \u2013 feeling very low and lethargic mania \u2013 feeling very high and overactive (less severe mania is known as hypomania) Symptoms of bipolar disorder depend on which mood you're experiencing. Unlike simple mood swings, each extreme episode of bipolar disorder can last for several weeks (or even longer), and some people may not experience a \"normal\" mood very often. Depression You may initially be diagnosed with clinical depression before having a future manic episode (sometimes years later), after which you may be diagnosed with bipolar disorder. During an episode of depression, you may have overwhelming feelings of worthlessness, which can potentially lead to thoughts of suicide. If you're feeling suicidal or having severe depressive symptoms, contact your GP, care co-ordinator or local mental health emergency services as soon as possible. If you want to talk to someone confidentially, call the Samaritans, free of charge, on 116 123. You can talk to them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Alternatively, visit the Samaritans website or email jo@samaritans.org. Mania During a manic phase of bipolar disorder, you may feel very happy and have lots of energy, ambitious plans and ideas. You may spend large amounts of money on things you can't afford and wouldn't normally want. Not feeling like eating or sleeping, talking quickly and becoming annoyed easily are also common characteristics of this phase. You may feel very creative and view the manic phase of bipolar as a positive experience. However, you may also experience symptoms of psychosis, where you see or hear things that aren't there or become convinced of things that aren't true. Living with bipolar disorder The high and low phases of bipolar disorder are often so extreme that they interfere with everyday life. However, there are several options for treating bipolar disorder that can make a difference. They aim to control the effects of an episode and help someone with bipolar disorder live life as normally as possible. The following treatment options are available: medication to prevent episodes of mania, hypomania (less severe mania) and depression \u2013 these are known as mood stabilisers and are taken every day on a long-term basis medication to treat the main symptoms of depression and mania when they occur learning to recognise the triggers and signs of an episode of depression or mania psychological treatment \u2013 such as talking therapy, which can help you deal with depression, and provides advice about how to improve your relationships lifestyle advice \u2013 such as doing regular exercise, planning activities you enjoy that give you a sense of achievement, as well as advice on improving your diet and getting more sleep It's thought using a combination of different treatment methods is the best way to control bipolar disorder. Help and advice for people with a long-term condition or their carers is also available from charities, support groups and associations. This includes self-help and self-management advice, and learning to deal with the practical aspects of a long-term condition. Find out more about living with bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder and pregnancy Bipolar disorder, like all other mental health problems, can get worse during pregnancy. However, specialist help is available if you need it. Read more about bipolar disorder in pregnancy. What causes bipolar disorder? The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, although it's believed a number of things can trigger an episode. Extreme stress, overwhelming problems and life-changing events are thought to contribute, as well as genetic and chemical factors. Who's affected? Bipolar disorder is fairly common and one in every 100 adults will be diagnosed with the condition at some point in their life. Bipolar disorder can occur at any age, although it often develops between the ages of 15 and 19 and rarely develops after 40. Men and women from all backgrounds are equally likely to develop bipolar disorder. The pattern of mood swings in bipolar disorder varies widely between people. For example, some people only have a couple of bipolar episodes in their lifetime and are stable in between, while others have many episodes. Bipolar disorder and driving If you have bipolar disorder, the condition may impair your driving. You must inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about any medical condition that could affect your ability to drive.

In rare cases, it can affect humans. There are many different strains of bird flu virus, most of which don't infect humans. However, two particular strains have caused serious concern in recent years: H5N1 (since 1997) H7N9 (since 2013) Although these viruses don't infect people easily and aren't usually transmitted from human to human, several people have been infected around the world, leading to a number of deaths. Other bird flu viruses \u2013 particularly H7N7 and H9N2, and more recently H6N1, H10N8 and H5N6 \u2013 have also infected people, but these have been very rare or only rarely caused severe illness. Bird flu affects many species of birds, including chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese. It can be passed between commercial, wild and pet birds. Birds don't always get sick from infection, so seemingly healthy birds may still pose a risk to people who come into contact with them. Bird flu in the UK No humans have been infected with bird flu in the UK, although plans are in place to manage any suspected cases. A few cases of bird flu were confirmed in poultry in the UK recently. In February 2015, a low-severity H7N7 strain of bird flu was confirmed at a farm in Hampshire, but restrictions around the premises were lifted 21 days later after cleaning and disinfection. Before that, in November 2014, H5N8 bird flu was confirmed at a duck breeding farm in Yorkshire, but the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the risk to public health was very low. This is because H5N8 infection was not found in humans during the recent worldwide epidemic among birds. The last reported case of H5N1 in the UK was in early 2008. You can read reports on recent cases of bird flu in the UK on the GOV.UK website. Signs and symptoms Like other types of flu, bird flu symptoms often include: a high temperature (fever) aching muscles headache respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose Diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal (tummy) pain, chest pain, and bleeding from the nose and gums have also been reported as early symptoms in some people. These symptoms can come on suddenly. The time from infection to the start of symptoms (incubation period) is usually three to five days, although in some cases it can be up to seven days. Within days of symptoms appearing, potentially fatal complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure may develop. Prompt treatment with antiviral medication may help prevent complications and reduce the risk of death. Treatment People with suspected symptoms of bird flu (avian flu) will be advised to stay at home, or will be cared for in hospital in isolation from other patients. The main recommendations are: resting drinking plenty of fluids and eating healthily taking medication to help treat fever and pain, such as aspirin and paracetamol Antiviral medication In the UK, certain antiviral medications have been stockpiled for use in the event of an outbreak. These medications work by stopping the virus multiplying in your body. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Zanamivir (Relenza) and Peramivir (Rapivab) help reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival. For regular flu, these medications are most effective if given within 48 hours of symptoms developing, but it's not clear if this is the case for bird flu. Nevertheless, they should be given as soon as possible to people suspected or proven to be infected, even if it's more than 48 hours after symptoms started. These medications may also be given as a preventative measure to people who could have been exposed to bird flu viruses \u2013 for example, other household members, healthcare workers, or people who have had close contact with infected birds. In these cases, the course of medication should begin as soon as possible after exposure to the virus and continue for 7 to 10 days after the last known exposure. Treating complications Complications such as bacterial pneumonia may develop in some people and can be treated with regular antibiotics. People who are severely affected may need to be given extra oxygen to help them breathe \u2013 for example, through a ventilator (a machine that assists with breathing). When to seek medical advice You should contact your GP or call NHS 111 immediately if you experience these symptoms and you've visited an area affected by bird flu in the last two weeks. An initial assessment can be made over the phone, at a GP surgery, at home, or in a side room at a hospital. Bird flu is diagnosed based on your symptoms and the likelihood that you've been exposed to an infected bird. The doctor will ask you whether you've: recently travelled to an area affected by bird flu and if you've been close (within one metre) to live or dead domestic fowl or wild birds, including those at bird markets had close contact (touching or speaking distance) with anyone who has a severe respiratory illness had contact with anyone who died unexpectedly and who was from an area that had an outbreak If bird flu is suspected, the following tests will be carried out to establish whether you have the infection: chest X-ray virus detection using a nose and throat swab blood tests If the laboratory tests and chest X-ray results are normal, it's unlikely you have bird flu. You can read about outbreaks of bird flu in the UK on the GOV.UK website. How bird flu spreads to humans Bird flu is spread through direct contact with infected birds (dead or alive), an infected bird's droppings, or secretions from their eyes or respiratory tract. Close and prolonged contact with an infected bird is generally required for the infection to spread to humans. For example: touching infected birds that are dead or alive inhaling or being in contact with dried dust from the droppings or bedding of infected birds inhaling or being in contact with droplets sneezed by infected birds culling, slaughtering, butchering or preparing infected poultry for cooking Another possible source of bird flu can be live markets, where birds are sold in crowded and sometimes unsanitary conditions. Avoid visiting these markets if you're travelling in countries that have had an outbreak of bird flu. Bird flu isn't transmitted through cooked food. Poultry and eggs are safe to eat in areas that have experienced outbreaks of bird flu. Preventing bird flu There are a number of things you can do to reduce your risk when you visit areas where outbreaks have been reported, such as: avoid visiting live animal markets and poultry farms avoid contact with surfaces that are contaminated with bird droppings don't pick up or touch birds (dead or alive) don't eat or handle undercooked or raw poultry, egg or duck dishes don't bring any live poultry products back to the UK, including feathers always practise good personal hygiene, such as washing your hands regularly There are no restrictions on travel to countries that have been or are currently affected by bird flu. Read more about preventing bird flu. Reporting suspected cases of bird flu Bird flu is a notifiable disease in animals and you should report any suspected case to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), even if you're not sure. Call the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) helpline on 08459 33 55 77 if you find five or more dead birds in the same place. Read about notifiable diseases in animals on the GOV.UK website. Human cases The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that by May 2015, 840 people had been infected with the H5N1 virus worldwide and 447 had died. Indonesia, Egypt and Vietnam experienced most cases and fatalities. Since March 2013, there have been reports of people being infected with the H7N9 virus, mostly in the southeastern part of mainland China. By May 2015, there had been 665 confirmed cases and 229 deaths. Most cases were among middle-aged to elderly men. A small number of cases were reported in travellers from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and Canada. For both viruses, there have been some reports of limited human to human transmission, usually as a result of very close contact between family members. People who have had bird flu generally developed the virus after coming into close and prolonged contact with infected birds. Millions of birds have been killed during outbreaks to prevent the disease spreading and being passed on to people.

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: Combined pill The combined oral contraceptive pill is usually just called \"the pill\". It contains artificial versions of the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which women produce naturally in their ovaries. At a glance: the combined pill   How the combined pill works   What to do if you miss a pill   Who can use the combined pill   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks of the combined pill A woman can get pregnant if a man\u2019s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the combined pill. The hormones in the pill prevent your ovaries from releasing an egg (ovulating). They also make it difficult for sperm to reach an egg, or for an egg to implant itself in the lining of the womb. The pill is usually taken to prevent pregnancy, but can also be used to treat painful periods, heavy periods, premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and endometriosis. At a glance: the combined pill When taken correctly, the pill is over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. This means that fewer than one woman in 100 who use the combined pill as contraception will get pregnant in one year. You need to take the pill every day for 21 days, then stop for seven days, and during this week you have a period-type bleed. You start taking the pill again after seven days. You need to take the pill at the same time every day. You could get pregnant if you don't do this, or if you miss a pill, or vomit or have severe diarrhoea. If you have heavy periods or painful periods, the combined pill can help. Minor side effects include mood swings, breast tenderness and headaches. There is no evidence that the pill makes women gain weight. There's a very low risk of serious side effects, such as blood clots and cervical cancer. The combined pill is not suitable for women over 35 who smoke, or women with certain medical conditions. The pill does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so using a condom as well will help to protect you against STIs. How the combined pill works How it prevents pregnancy Monophasic 21-day pills Phasic 21-day pills Every day (ED) pills How to take 21-day pills How to take every day pills Starting the combined pill Taking pill packs back-to-back How it prevents pregnancy The pill prevents the ovaries from releasing an egg each month (ovulation). It also: thickens the mucus in the neck of the womb, so it is harder for sperm to penetrate the womb and reach an egg thins the lining of the womb, so there is less chance of a fertilised egg implanting into the womb and being able to grow Although there are many different brands of pill, there are three main types: Monophasic 21-day pills This is the most common type. Each pill has the same amount of hormone in it. One pill is taken each day for 21 days and then no pills are taken for the next seven days. Microgynon, Brevinor and Cilest are examples of this type of pill. Phasic 21-day pills Phasic pills contain two or three sections of different coloured pills in a pack. Each section contains a different amount of hormones. One pill is taken each day for 21 days and then no pills are taken for the next seven days. Phasic pills need to be taken in the right order. Binovum and Logynon are examples of this type of pill. Every day (ED) pills You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you There are 21 active pills and seven inactive (dummy) pills in a pack. The two types of pill look different. One pill is taken each day for 28 days with no break between packets of pills. Every day pills need to be taken in the right order. Microgynon ED and Logynon ED are examples of this type of pill. Follow the instructions that come with your packet. If you have any questions about how to take the pill, ask your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist. It's important to take the pills as instructed, because missing pills or taking them at the same time as certain medicines may make them less effective. How to take 21-day pills Take your first pill from the packet marked with the correct day of the week, or the first pill of the first colour (phasic pills). Continue to take a pill at the same time each day until the pack is finished.  Stop taking pills for seven days (during these seven days you will get a bleed).  Start your next pack of pills on the eighth day, whether you are still bleeding or not. This should be the same day of the week as when you took your first pill. How to take every day pills Take the first pill from the section of the packet marked \"start\". This will be an active pill. Continue to take a pill every day, in the correct order and preferably at the same time each day, until the pack is finished (28 days).  During the seven days of taking the inactive pills, you will get a bleed. Start your next pack of pills after you have finished the first, whether you are still bleeding or not. Starting the combined pill Most women can start the pill at any time in their menstrual cycle. There is special guidance if you have just had a baby, abortion or miscarriage. You may need to use additional contraception during your first days on the pill \u2013 this depends on when in your menstrual cycle you start taking it. If you start the combined pill on the first day of your period (day one of your menstrual cycle) you will be protected from pregnancy straight away. You will not need additional contraception. If you start the pill on the fifth day of your period or before, you will still be protected from pregnancy straight away, unless you have a short menstrual cycle (your period is every 23 days or less). If you have a short menstrual cycle, you will need additional contraception, such as condoms, until you have taken the pill for seven days. If you start the pill on any other day of your cycle, you will not be protected from pregnancy straight away and will need additional contraception until you have taken the pill for seven days. Taking pill packs back-to-back For monophasic combined pills (pills all the same colour and with the same level of hormones), it is normally fine to start a new pack of pills straight after your last one \u2013 for example, if you want to delay your period for a holiday. However, avoid taking more than two packs together unless advised to by a doctor or nurse. This is because you may have breakthrough bleeding as the womb lining sheds slightly. Some women find they feel bloated if they run several packs of the pill together. What to do if you miss a pill If you miss a pill or pills, or you start a pack late, this can make the pill less effective at preventing pregnancy. The chance of getting pregnant after missing a pill or pills depends on: when the pills are missed how many pills are missed A pill is late when you have forgotten to take it at your usual time. You have missed a pill when it is more than 24 hours since the time you should have taken it. Missing one pill anywhere in your pack or starting the new pack one day late isn\u2019t a problem, as you will still be protected against pregnancy (known as having contraceptive cover). However, missing two or more pills, or starting the pack two or more days late (more than 48 hours late) may affect your contraceptive cover. In particular, if you make the seven-day pill-free break longer by forgetting two or more pills, your ovaries might release an egg and there is a risk of getting pregnant. This is because your ovaries are not getting any effect from the pill during the seven-day break. If you miss a pill, follow the advice below. If you are not sure what to do, continue to take your pill and use another method of contraception, such as condoms, and seek advice as soon as possible. If you have missed one pill, anywhere in the pack: take the last pill you missed now, even if it means taking two pills in one day continue taking the rest of the pack as usual you don\u2019t need to use additional contraception, such as condoms take your seven-day pill-free break as normal If you have missed two or more pills (you are taking your pill more than 48 hours late) anywhere in the pack: take the last pill you missed now, even if it means taking two pills in one day leave any earlier missed pills continue taking the rest of the pack as usual and use an extra method of contraception for the next seven days you may need emergency contraception you may need to start the next pack of pills without a break (see Starting the next pack after missing two or more pills) You may need emergency contraception if you have had unprotected sex in the previous seven days and have missed two or more pills (you are taking your pill more than 48 hours late) in the first week of a pack. Get advice from your contraception clinic, doctor or pharmacist about this. You can also call NHS 111 or the Sexual Health Line on 0300 123 7123. Starting the next pack after missing two or more pills If there are seven or more pills left in the pack after the last missed pill: finish the pack have the usual seven-day break If there are fewer than seven pills left in the pack after the last missed pill:  finish the pack and start the new one the next day, without having a break Vomiting and diarrhoea If you vomit within two hours of taking the combined pill, it may not have been fully absorbed into your bloodstream. Take another pill straight away and the next pill at your usual time. If you continue to be sick, keep using another form of contraception while you're ill and for two days after recovering. Very severe diarrhoea (six to eight watery stools in 24 hours) may also mean that the pill doesn't work properly. Keep taking your pill as normal, but use additional contraception, such as condoms, while you have diarrhoea and for two days after recovering. Speak to your GP or contraception nurse or call NHS 111 for more information, or if your sickness or diarrhoea continues. Who can use the combined pill If there are no medical reasons why you cannot take the pill and you do not smoke, you can take the pill until your menopause. However, the pill is not suitable for all women. To find out whether the pill is right for you, talk to your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist. You should not take the pill if you: are pregnant smoke and are 35 or older stopped smoking less than a year ago and are 35 or older are very overweight take certain medicines (ask your GP about this) You should also not take the pill if you have (or have had): thrombosis (a blood clot) a heart abnormality or heart disease, including high blood pressure severe migraines, especially with aura (warning symptoms) breast cancer disease of the gallbladder or liver diabetes with complications or diabetes for the past 20 years After having a baby If you have just had a baby and are not breastfeeding, you can start the pill on day 21 after the birth. You will be protected against pregnancy straight away. If you start the pill later than 21 days after giving birth, you will need additional contraception (such as condoms) for the next seven days. If you are breastfeeding a baby less than six months old, taking the pill can reduce your flow of milk. It is recommended that you use a different method of contraception until you stop breastfeeding. After a miscarriage or abortion If you have had a miscarriage or abortion, you can start the pill up to five days after this and you will be protected from pregnancy straight away. If you start the pill more than five days after the miscarriage or abortion, you'll need to use additional contraception until you have taken the pill for seven days. Advantages and disadvantages Some advantages of the pill include: it does not interrupt sex it usually makes your bleeds regular, lighter and less painful it reduces your risk of cancer of the ovaries, womb and colon it can reduce symptoms of PMS it can sometimes reduce acne it may protect against pelvic inflammatory disease it may reduce the risk of fibroids, ovarian cysts and non-cancerous breast disease Some disadvantages of the pill include: it can cause temporary side effects at first, such as headaches, nausea, breast tenderness and mood swings \u2013 if these do not go after a few months, it may help to change to a different pill it can increase your blood pressure it does not protect you against sexually transmitted infections breakthrough bleeding and spotting is common in the first few months of using the pill it has been linked to an increased risk of some serious health conditions, such as thrombosis (blood clots) and breast cancer The combined pill with other medicines Some medicines interact with the combined pill and it doesn't work properly. Some interactions are listed on this page, but it is not a complete list. If you want to check your medicines are safe to take with the combined pill, you can: ask your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine Antibiotics The antibiotics rifampicin and rifabutin (which can be used to treat illnesses including tuberculosis and meningitis) can reduce the effectiveness of the combined pill. Other antibiotics do not have this effect. If you are prescribed rifampicin or rifabutin, you may need additional contraception (such as condoms) while taking the antibiotic. Speak to your doctor or nurse for advice. Epilepsy and HIV medicines, and St John's wort The combined pill can interact with medicines called enzyme inducers. These speed up the breakdown of progestogen by your liver, reducing the effectiveness of the pill. Examples of enzyme inducers are: the epilepsy drugs carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone and topiramate St John's wort (a herbal remedy) antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV (research suggests that interactions between these medicines and the progestogen-only pill can affect the safety and effectiveness of both) Your GP or nurse may advise you to use an alternative or additional form of contraception while taking any of these medicines. Risks of taking the combined pill There are some risks associated with using the combined contraceptive pill. However, these risks are small and, for most women, the benefits of the pill outweigh the risks. Blood clots The oestrogen in the pill may cause your blood to clot more readily. If a blood clot develops, it could cause deep vein thrombosis (clot in your leg), pulmonary embolus (clot in your lung), stroke or heart attack. The risk of getting a blood clot is very small, but your doctor will check if you have certain risk factors that make you more vulnerable before prescribing the pill. The pill can be taken with caution if you have one of the risk factors below, but you should not take it if you have two or more risk factors. These include: being 35 years old or over being a smoker or having quit smoking in the past year being very overweight (in women with a BMI of 35 or over, the risks of using the pill usually outweigh the benefits) having migraines (you should not take the pill if you have severe or regular migraine attacks, especially if you get aura or a warning sign before an attack) having high blood pressure having had a blood clot or stroke in the past having a close relative who had a blood clot when they were younger than 45 being immobile for a long time \u2013 for example, in a wheelchair or with a leg in plaster Cancer Research is ongoing into the link between breast cancer and the pill. Research suggests that users of all types of hormonal contraception have a slightly higher chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer compared with women who do not use them. However, 10 years after you stop taking the pill, your risk of breast cancer goes back to normal. Research has also suggested a link between the pill and the risk of developing cervical cancer and a rare form of liver cancer. However, the pill does offer some protection against developing endometrium (lining of the womb) cancer, ovarian cancer and colon cancer. Where you can get the combined pill Most types of contraception are available for free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics sexual health clinics \u2013 they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people's services (call the Sexual Health Line on 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching by postcode or town. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won't tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.   Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 29\/12\/2014 Next review due: 29\/12\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: Condoms A woman can get pregnant if a man\u2019s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the condom. At a glance: condoms   How a condom works   Who can use condoms   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks of condoms    Where to get condoms There are two types of condoms: male condoms, which are worn on the penis, and female condoms, which are worn inside the vagina. This page is about male condoms, where you can get them and how they work. Male condoms are made from very thin latex (rubber), polyisoprene or polyurethane, and are designed to stop a man's semen from coming into contact with his sexual partner. When condoms are used correctly during vaginal sex, they help to protect against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). When used correctly during anal and oral sex, they help to protect against STIs. Condoms are the only contraception that protect against pregnancy and STIs. At a glance: condoms If used correctly every time you have sex, male condoms are 98% effective. This means that two out of 100 women using male condoms as contraception will become pregnant in one year. You can get free condoms from contraception clinics, sexual health clinics and some GP surgeries. Oil-based products, such as moisturiser, lotion and Vaseline, can make latex and polyisoprene condoms less effective, but they are safe to use with condoms made from polyurethane. Water-based lubricant, available in pharmacies and sexual health clinics, is safe to use with all condoms. It's possible for a condom to slip off during sex. If this happens, you may need emergency contraception, and to get checked for STIs. Condoms need to be stored in places that aren't too hot or cold, and away from sharp or rough surfaces that could tear them or wear them away. Putting on a condom can be an enjoyable part of sex, and doesn't have to feel like an interruption. If you're sensitive to latex, you can use polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms instead.  A condom must not be used more than once. Use a new one each time you have sex. Condoms have a use-by date on the packaging. Don't use out-of-date condoms. Always buy condoms that have the BSI kite mark and the CE mark on the packet. This means that they've been tested to high safety standards. Condoms that don't have the BSI kite mark and CE mark won't meet these standards, so don't use them. How a condom works Condoms are a barrier method of contraception. They stop sperm from reaching an egg by creating a physical barrier between them. Condoms can also protect against STIs if used correctly during vaginal, anal and oral sex. It's important that the man's penis does not make contact with the woman's vagina before a condom has been put on. This is because semen can come out of the penis before a man has fully ejaculated (come). If this happens, or if semen leaks into the vagina while using a condom, seek advice about emergency contraception from your GP or contraception clinic. You should also consider having an STI test. How to use a condom  Take the condom out of the packet, taking care not to tear it with jewellery or fingernails \u2013 do not open the packet with your teeth. Place the condom over the tip of the erect penis. If there's a teat on the end of the condom, use your thumb and forefinger to squeeze the air out of it. Gently roll the condom down to the base of the penis. If the condom won't roll down, you're probably holding it the wrong way round \u2013 if this happens, throw the condom away because it may have sperm on it, and try again with a new one. After sex, withdraw the penis while it's still erect \u2013 hold the condom onto the base of the penis while you do this.  Remove the condom from the penis, being careful not to spill any semen. Throw the condom away in a bin, not down the toilet. Make sure the man's penis does not touch his partner's genital area again. If you have sex again, use a new condom. Condoms with spermicide Some male condoms come with spermicide on them. Spermicide is a chemical that kills sperm. These condoms are slowly being phased out, as research has found that a spermicide called nonoxynol 9 does not protect against STIs such as chlamydia and HIV, and may even increase the risk of infection. It is best to avoid using spermicide-lubricated condoms, or spermicide as an additional lubricant. Who can use condoms Most people can safely use condoms. There are many different varieties and brands of male condom, and it's up to you and your partner which type of condom you use. However, condoms may not be the most suitable method of contraception for everyone. Some men and women are sensitive to the chemicals in latex condoms. If this is a problem, polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms have a lower risk of causing an allergic reaction. Men who have difficulty keeping an erection may not be able to use male condoms, as the penis must be erect to prevent semen leaking from the condom, or the condom slipping off.  Advantages and disadvantages of condoms It is important to consider which form of contraception is right for you and your partner. Take care to use condoms correctly, and consider using other forms of contraception for extra protection. Advantages When used correctly and consistently, condoms are a reliable method of preventing pregnancy.  They help to protect both partners from STIs, including chlamydia, gonorrhoea and HIV. You only need to use them when you have sex \u2013 they do not need advance preparation and are suitable for unplanned sex. In most cases, there are no medical side effects from using condoms. Male condoms are easy to get hold of and come in a variety of shapes, sizes and flavours. Disadvantages Some couples find that using condoms interrupts sex \u2013 to get around this, try to make using a condom part of foreplay.  Condoms are very strong, but may split or tear if not used properly. Some people may be allergic to latex, plastic or spermicides \u2013 you can get condoms that are less likely to cause an allergic reaction. When using a male condom, the man has to pull out after he has ejaculated and before the penis goes soft, holding the condom firmly in place. If male condoms aren't used properly, they can slip off or split. If this happens, practise putting them on so that you get used to using them properly.   Can anything make condoms less effective? Sperm can sometimes get into the vagina during sex, even when using a condom. This may happen if: the penis touches the area around the vagina before a condom is put on the condom splits or comes off the condom gets damaged by sharp fingernails or jewellery you use oil-based lubricants, such as lotion, baby oil or petroleum jelly, with latex or polyisoprene condoms \u2013 this damages the condom  you are using medication for conditions like thrush, such as creams, pessaries or suppositories \u2013 this can damage latex and polyisoprene condoms and stop them working properly If you think that sperm has entered the vagina, talk to your GP or staff at a contraception clinic about emergency contraception and the risk of STIs. As well as condoms, you can use other forms of contraception, such as the contraceptive pill, for extra protection against pregnancy. However, other forms of contraception will not protect you against STIs. You will still be at risk of STIs if the condom breaks. Using lubricant Condoms come ready lubricated to make them easier to use, but you may also like to use additional lubricant, or lube. This is particularly advised for anal sex, to reduce the chance of the condom splitting. Any kind of lubricant can be used with condoms that are not made of latex. However, if you are using latex or polyisoprene condoms, do not use oil-based lubricants, such as: body oil or lotion petroleum jelly or creams (such as Vaseline) This is because they can damage the condom and make it more likely to split. If a condom splits or comes off If the condom splits or comes off, you can use emergency contraception to help prevent pregnancy. This is for emergencies only and shouldn't be used as a regular form of contraception. Depending on the type of pill, you need to take the emergency contraceptive pill up to 72 hours or up to 120 hours (five days) after unprotected sex. The intrauterine device (IUD) can be used as emergency contraception up to five days after sex. If you have been at risk of pregnancy, you have also been at risk of STIs. You should have a check-up at: a GP surgery a contraception clinic a sexual health clinic or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic a young person's clinic Risks For most people, there are no serious risks associated with using condoms, although some people are allergic to latex condoms. You can get condoms that are less likely to cause an allergic reaction. Where to get condoms Everyone can get condoms for free, even if they are under 16. They are available from: contraception clinics sexual health or GUM (genitourinary medicine) clinics some GP surgeries  some young people's services Find sexual health services near you You can also buy condoms from: pharmacies supermarkets websites mail-order catalogues vending machines in some public toilets some petrol stations If you buy condoms online, make sure that you buy them from a pharmacist or other legitimate retailer. Always choose condoms that carry the BSI kite mark and the European CE mark as a sign of quality assurance. This means they have been tested to the required safety standards. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won't tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given, and your decisions.

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: The contraceptive injection A woman can get pregnant if a man\u2019s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the injection. At a glance: the contraceptive injection   How it works   Who can use it   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks   Where you can get it There are three types of contraceptive injections in the UK: Depo-Provera, which lasts for 12 weeks, Sayana Press, which lasts for 13 weeks, and Noristerat, which lasts for eight weeks. The most popular is Depo-Provera. Noristerat is usually used for only short periods of time \u2013 for example, if your partner is waiting for a vasectomy. The injection contains progestogen. This thickens the mucus in the cervix, stopping sperm reaching an egg. It also thins the womb lining and, in some, prevents the release of an egg. At a glance: the contraceptive injection If used correctly, the contraceptive injection is more than 99% effective. This means that less than one woman in 100 who use the injection will become pregnant in a year. The injection lasts for eight, 12 or 13 weeks (depending on the type), so you don't have to think about contraception every day or every time you have sex. It can be useful for women who might forget to take the contraceptive pill every day. It can be useful for women who can't use contraception that contains oestrogen. It's not affected by medication. The contraceptive injection may provide some protection against cancer of the womb and pelvic inflammatory disease. Side effects can include weight gain, headaches, mood swings, breast tenderness and irregular bleeding. The injection can't be removed from your body, so if you have side effects they'll last as long as the injection and for some time afterwards. Your periods may become more irregular or longer, or stop altogether (amenorrhoea). Treatment is available if your bleeding is heavy or longer than normal \u2013 talk to your doctor or nurse about this. It can take up to one year for your fertility to return to normal after the injection wears off, so it may not be suitable if you want to have a baby in the near future. Using Depo-Provera affects your natural oestrogen levels, which can cause thinning of the bones.  The injection does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using condoms as well as the injection, you'll help to protect yourself against STIs. How the injection works You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you The contraceptive injections Depo-Provera and Noristerat are usually given into a muscle in your bottom, although sometimes may be given in a muscle in your upper arm. Sayana Press is given under the skin (subcutaneously) rather than into a muscle, in the abdomen or thigh. The contraceptive injection works in the same way as the implant. It steadily releases the hormone progestogen into your bloodstream. Progestogen is similar to the natural hormone progesterone, which is released by a woman's ovaries during her period. The continuous release of progestogen: stops a woman releasing an egg every month (ovulation)  thickens the mucus from the cervix (neck of the womb), making it difficult for sperm to pass through to the womb and reach an unfertilised egg  makes the lining of the womb thinner, so that it is unable to support a fertilised egg The injection can be given at any time during your menstrual cycle, as long as you and your doctor are reasonably sure you are not pregnant. When it starts to work If you have the injection during the first five days of your cycle, you will be immediately protected against becoming pregnant.  If you have the injection on any other day of your cycle, you will not be protected against pregnancy for up to seven days. Use condoms or another method of contraception during this time. After giving birth You can have the contraceptive injection at any time after you have given birth, if you are not breastfeeding. If you are breastfeeding, the injection will usually be given after six weeks, although it may be given earlier if necessary. If you start injections on or before day 21 after giving birth, you will be immediately protected against becoming pregnant. If you start injections after day 21, you will need to use additional contraception for the following seven days. Heavy and irregular bleeding is more likely to occur if you have the contraceptive injection during the first few weeks after giving birth. It is safe to use contraceptive injections while you are breastfeeding. After a miscarriage or abortion You can have the injection immediately after a miscarriage or abortion, and you will be protected against pregnancy straight away. If you have the injection more than five days after a miscarriage or abortion, you'll need to use additional contraception for seven days. Who can use the injection? Most women can be given the contraceptive injection. It may not be suitable if you: think you might be pregnant  want to keep having regular periods  have bleeding in between periods or after sex  have arterial disease or a history of heart disease or stroke have a blood clot in a blood vessel (thrombosis)  have liver disease  have migraines  have breast cancer or have had it in the past  have diabetes with complications  have cirrhosis or liver tumours are at risk of osteoporosis   Advantages and disadvantages of the injection The main advantages of the contraceptive injection are: each injection lasts for either eight, 12 or 13 weeks  the injection does not interrupt sex  the injection is an option if you cannot use oestrogen-based contraception, such as the combined pill, contraceptive patch or vaginal ring you do not have to remember to take a pill every day the injection is safe to use while you are breastfeeding  the injection is not affected by other medicines the injection may reduce heavy, painful periods and help with premenstrual symptoms for some women the injection offers some protection from pelvic inflammatory disease (the mucus from the cervix may stop bacteria entering the womb) and may also give some protection against cancer of the womb Using the contraceptive injection may have some disadvantages, which you should consider carefully before deciding on the right method of contraception for you. These are as follows: Disrupted periods Your periods may change significantly during the first year of using the injection. They will usually become irregular and may be very heavy, or shorter and lighter, or stop altogether. This may settle down after the first year, but may continue as long as the injected progestogen remains in your body. It can take a while for your periods and natural fertility to return after you stop using the injection. It takes around eight to 12 weeks for injected progestogen to leave the body, but you may have to wait longer for your periods to return to normal if you are trying to get pregnant. Until you are ovulating regularly each month, it can be difficult to work out when you are at your most fertile. In some cases, it can take three months to a year for your periods to return to normal. Weight gain You may put on weight when you use the contraceptive injection, particulaly if you are under 18 years old and are overweight with a BMI (body mass index) of 30 or over.    Other side effects that some women report are: headaches acne tender breasts changes in mood loss of sex drive Depo-Provera, oestrogen and bone risk Using Depo-Provera affects your natural oestrogen levels, which can cause thinning of the bones, but it does not increase your risk of breaking a bone. This isn't a problem for most women, because the bone replaces itself when you stop the injection, and it doesn't appear to cause any long-term problems. Thinning of the bones may be a problem for women who already have an increased risk of developing osteoporosis (for example, because they have low oestrogen, or a family history of osteoporosis). It may also be a concern for women under 18, because the body is still making bone at this age. Women under 18 may use Depo-Provera, but only after careful evaluation by a doctor. Will other medicines affect the injection? No \u2013 the contraceptive injection is not affected by other medication. Risks There is a small risk of infection at the site of the injection. In very rare cases, some people may have an allergic reaction to the injection. Where you can get it Most types of contraception are available free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics  sexual health clinics \u2013 they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people\u2019s services (call 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching your postcode or town. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won't tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: The contraceptive patch A woman can get pregnant if a man\u2019s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart, or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the patch. At a glance: the patch   How it works   Who can use it   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks   Where you can get it  The contraceptive patch is a sticky patch, a bit like a nicotine patch, measuring 5x5cm. It delivers hormones into your body through your skin. In the UK, the patch's brand name is Evra. It contains the same hormones as the combined pill, and it works in the same way. This means that it prevents ovulation (the release of an egg); it thickens cervical mucus, which makes it more difficult for sperm to travel through the cervix; and it thins the womb lining, making it less likely that a fertilised egg will implant there. At a glance: facts about the patch When used correctly, the patch is more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. Each patch lasts for one week. You change the patch every week for three weeks, then have a week off without a patch. You don't need to think about it every day, and it's still effective if you vomit or have diarrhoea. You can wear the patch in the bath, in the swimming pool and while playing sports.   If you have heavy or painful periods, the patch can help. The patch can increase blood pressure, and some women get temporary side effects, such as headaches.   Some women develop a blood clot when using the patch, but this is rare. The patch may protect against ovarian cancer, womb cancer and colon cancer. The patch may not be suitable for women who smoke and who are 35 or over, or who weigh 90kg (14 stone) or more. The patch does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so using a condom as well will help to protect you against STIs. How it works How you use the patch  When the patch starts to work What to do if the patch falls off What to do if you forget to take the patch off  Bleeding in the patch-free week  How you use the patch You can use the contraceptive patch on most areas of your body, as long as the skin is clean, dry and not very hairy.  You apply a new patch once a week (every seven days) for three weeks, and then stop using the patch for seven days. This is known as your patch-free week. During your patch-free week you will get a withdrawal bleed, like a period, although this may not always happen. After seven patch-free days, you apply a new patch and start the four-week cycle again. Start your new cycle even if you are still bleeding. You should not stick the patch on: sore or irritated skin  anywhere it may get rubbed off by tight clothing  your breasts When you first start using the patch, you can vary the position every time you use a new patch to reduce your risk of irritation. When the patch starts to work The licence for the patch states that if you start using the patch on the first day of your period, it starts working straight away. This means you can have sex without getting pregnant. The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare guidance states that if you start using the patch in the first five days of your menstrual cycle, you will be protected and won't need to use additional contraception. If you start using it on any other day, you need to use an additional form of contraception, such as condoms, for the first seven days. You can talk to your doctor or nurse for more information about when the patch will start to work, and whether you need to use additional contraception. What to do if the patch falls off The contraceptive patch is very sticky and should stay on. It should not come off after a shower, bath, hot tub, sauna or swim, or after exercise. If the patch does fall off, what you need to do depends on how long it has been off, and how many days you had a patch on before it came off. If the patch has been off for less than 48 hours: stick your patch back on as soon as possible (if it is still sticky) if it is not sticky, replace it with a new patch (do not try to hold the old patch in place with a plaster or bandage) continue to use your patch as normal and change your patch on your normal change day If the patch has been off for less than 48 hours before you replace it, you will still be protected against pregnancy as long as the patch was on properly for seven days before the patch came off. If this is the case, you do not need to use additional contraception. If you have had a patch on for six days or less before it falls off, you may not be protected against pregnancy and should use additional contraception, such as condoms, for seven days. If the patch has been off for 48 hours or more, or you're not sure how long it has been off: apply a new patch as soon as possible and start a new patch cycle (this will now be day one of your new cycle)  use another form of contraception, such as condoms, for the next seven days If you had unprotected sex in the previous few days, you may need emergency contraception. See your GP, nurse or local sexual health (GUM) clinic if you are concerned. What to do if you forget to take the patch off If you forget to take the patch off after week one or two, what you need to do depends on how long you have forgotten it. If it has been on for: Less than 48 hours longer than it should have been (eight or nine days in total) \u2013 take off the old patch and put on a new one. Continue to use your patch as normal, changing it on your normal change day. You don\u2019t need to use any additional contraception and you are protected against pregnancy.  48 hours or more longer than it should have been (10 days or more in total) \u2013 start a whole new patch cycle by applying a new patch as soon as possible. This is now week one of the patch cycle and you will have a new day of the week as your start day and change day. Use another method of contraception, such as condoms, for the next seven days. Ask your doctor or nurse for advice if you have had sex in the previous few days and were not using a condom, as you may need emergency contraception. If you forget to take the patch off after week three, take the patch off as soon as possible and start your patch-free break. Start a new patch on your usual start day, even if you are bleeding. This means that you will not have a full week of patch-free days. You will be protected against pregnancy and do not need to use any additional contraception. You may or may not bleed on the patch-free days. What to do if you forget to put a patch on after the patch-free week There is no specific research on what happens if the patch-free week is longer than seven days. The patch works in a similar way to the vaginal ring and the combined pill, and advice for extending the patch-free week is based on what is known about the vaginal ring and combined pill. If you forget to put on a patch at the end of the patch-free week, put a new one on as soon as you remember. If you put the patch on 48 hours late or less (so the patch-free interval has been nine days or less), you will still be protected against pregnancy, as long as you wore the patch correctly before the patch-free interval. If you put the patch on more than 48 hours late, so the interval has been 10 days or more, you may not be protected against pregnancy and need to use additional contraception, such as condoms, for seven days. Ask your doctor or nurse for advice if you have had sex in the patch-free interval, as you may need emergency contraception.   Bleeding in the patch-free week Some women do not always have a bleed in their patch-free week. This is nothing to worry about if you have used the patch properly and have not taken any medication that could affect it. See your GP or nurse for advice if you are worried, or do a pregnancy test to check if you are pregnant. If you miss more than two bleeds, get medical advice. Who can use the patch You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you The contraceptive patch is not suitable for everyone. If you are thinking of using it, your doctor or nurse will need to ask you about your health and your family\u2019s medical history, to make sure the patch is suitable for you. It is very important to tell them about any illnesses or operations you have had, or medications you are currently taking. Conditions and circumstances that may mean you should not use the patch include:  you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant  you are breastfeeding  you smoke and are 35 or over you are 35 or over and stopped smoking less than a year ago  you are very overweight you take certain medicines, such as some antibiotics, St John\u2019s Wort or medicines used to treat epilepsy, tuberculosis (TB) or HIV You will also not be able to use the patch if you have (or have had) any of the following conditions:  thrombosis (blood clots) in a vein or artery a heart problem or a disease affecting your blood circulatory system (including high blood pressure) migraine with aura (warning signs) breast cancer disease of the liver or gallbladder  diabetes with complications, or diabetes for more than 20 years Advantages and disadvantages of the patch If it is used properly, the contraceptive patch is more than 99% effective in stopping you from getting pregnant. This means that if 100 women use the patch according to the instructions, fewer than one will get pregnant in a year. Other advantages of the patch are: it is very easy to use and does not interrupt sex unlike the combined oral contraceptive pill, you do not have to think about it every day \u2013 you only have to remember to change the patch once a week the hormones from the contraceptive patch do not need to be absorbed by the stomach, so it is just as effective even if you vomit or have diarrhoea like the pill, it tends to make your periods more regular, lighter and less painful it can help with premenstrual symptoms it may reduce the risk of ovarian, womb and bowel cancer it may reduce the risk of fibroids, ovarian cysts and non-cancerous breast disease Some women may find that the contraceptive patch has some disadvantages and may wish to use a different form of contraception. Some potential disadvantages of the patch are that: it may be visible it can cause skin irritation, itching and soreness it does not protect you against STIs, so you may need to use condoms as well some women get mild temporary side effects when they first start using the patch, such as headaches, nausea (sickness), breast tenderness and mood changes; these side effects usually settle down after a few months bleeding between periods (breakthrough bleeding) and spotting (very light, irregular bleeding) is common in the first few cycles of using the patch; this is nothing to worry about if you are using the patch properly, and you will still be protected against pregnancy Some medicines can make the patch less effective. If you are prescribed new medicine or are buying an over-the-counter medicine, ask the doctor or pharmacist for advice. You may need to use an extra form of contraception while you are taking the medicine, and for 28 days afterwards. Risks of using the patch There is a very small risk of some serious side effects when you use a hormonal contraceptive, such as the contraceptive patch or combined pill. Blood clots The patch slightly increases your chance of developing a blood clot, which can block a vein (venous thrombosis) or an artery (arterial thrombosis, which may lead to a heart attack or stroke). If you have had a blood clot before, do not use the patch. Your risk of blood clots is higher during the first year of using the patch. Your risk is also higher if: you smoke you are very overweight  you are immobile (unable to move) or use a wheelchair you have severe varicose veins  a close family member had a venous thrombosis before they were 45 years old The risk of arterial thrombosis is greatest if: you smoke you are diabetic you have high blood pressure (hypertension) you are very overweight  you regularly have migraines with aura (warning signs) a close family member had a heart attack or stroke before they were 45 Cancer Current research suggests that people who use hormonal contraception, such as the contraceptive patch, are at a slightly increased risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer compared with people who do not use hormonal contraception. However, further research is needed to provide more definitive evidence. Research also suggests there is a small increase in your risk of developing cervical cancer with the long-term use of oestrogen and progestogen hormonal contraception. For most women, the benefits of the patch outweigh the risks. However, discuss all risks and benefits with your GP or nurse before starting to use the patch. You will not be allowed to use the patch if you are considered to be at a higher risk of serious side effects. Where you can get it Most types of contraception are available for free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. When you first get the contraceptive patch you will be given a three-month supply, to see how you get on with it. If there are no problems, you can be prescribed the patch for six months to a year. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics  sexual health clinics \u2013 they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people\u2019s services (call the Sexual Health Line on 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching by postcode or town. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won't tell your parents (or carer), as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: Emergency contraception (morning after pill, IUD) Emergency contraception can prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or if your contraceptive method has failed \u2013 for example, a condom has split or you've missed a pill. There are two types:  the emergency contraceptive pill (sometimes called the morning after pill) the IUD (intrauterine device, or coil) At a glance: emergency contraception   The emergency pill    The IUD as emergency contraception   Where to get emergency contraception   Contraception for the future There are two kinds of emergency contraceptive pill. Levonelle has to be taken within 72 hours (three days) of sex, and ellaOne has to be taken within 120 hours (five days) of sex. Both pills work by preventing or delaying ovulation (release of an egg). The IUD can be inserted into your uterus up to five days after unprotected sex, or up to five days after the earliest time you could have ovulated. It may stop an egg from being fertilised or implanting in your womb. Emergency contraception does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). At a glance: facts about emergency contraception Both types of emergency contraception are effective at preventing pregnancy if they are used soon after unprotected sex. Less than 1% of women who use the IUD get pregnant, whereas pregnancies after the emergency contraceptive pill are not as rare. It\u2019s thought that ellaOne is more effective than Levonelle. The sooner you take Levonelle or ellaOne, the more effective it will be. Levonelle or ellaOne can make you feel sick, dizzy or tired, or give you a headache, tender breasts or abdominal pain. Levonelle or ellaOne can make your period earlier or later than usual. If you\u2019re sick (vomit) within two hours of taking Levonelle, or three hours of taking ellaOne, seek medical advice as you will need to take another dose or have an IUD fitted. If you use the IUD as emergency contraception, it can be left in as your regular contraceptive method. If you use the IUD as a regular method of contraception, it can make your periods longer, heavier or more painful. You may feel some discomfort when the IUD is put in \u2013 painkillers can help to relieve this. There are no serious side effects of using emergency contraception. Emergency contraception does not cause an abortion. The emergency pill How the emergency pill works How effective the emergency pill is at preventing pregnancy How it affects your period  Who can use the emergency pill  During breastfeeding If you're already using the pill, patch, vaginal ring or injection Side effects of the emergency pill The emergency pill and other medicines Can I get the emergency pill in advance? How the emergency pill works Levonelle Levonelle contains levonorgestrel, a synthetic version of the natural hormone progesterone. In a woman\u2019s body, progesterone plays a role in ovulation and preparing the uterus for accepting a fertilised egg. It\u2019s not known exactly how Levonelle works, but it\u2019s thought to work primarily by preventing or delaying ovulation. It does not interfere with your regular method of contraception. ellaOne ellaOne contains ulipristal acetate, which stops progesterone working normally. It prevents pregnancy mainly by preventing or delaying ovulation.` Levonelle and ellaOne do not continue to protect you against pregnancy. This means that if you have unprotected sex at any time after taking the emergency pill you can become pregnant. Even if you are starting or continuing another method of hormonal contraception, it may not be effective immediately. You will need to use condoms or avoid sex until the contraception is working effectively. The time it takes for contraception to become effective depends on the emergency contraceptive pill and the method of hormonal contraception being started. Your doctor or nurse will tell you when you can start hormonal contraception and how long you will need to take additional precautions to prevent an unintended pregnancy. Levonelle and ellaOne are not intended to be used as a regular form of contraception. However, you can use emergency contraception more than once in a menstrual cycle if necessary. How effective is the emergency pill at preventing pregnancy? You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services some pharmacies  Find a clinic near you It can be difficult to know how many pregnancies the emergency pill prevents, because there is no way to know for sure how many women would have got pregnant if they did not take it. A study published in 2010 showed that of 1,696 women who received the emergency pill within 72 hours of sex, 37 became pregnant (1,659 did not). Of 203 women who took the emergency pill between 72 and 120 hours after unprotected sex, there were three pregnancies. Find out more about the research on the effectiveness of both emergency contraception pills. However, it's important to remember that the sooner you take emergency contraception after sex, the more effective it will be. How it affects your period After taking the emergency contraceptive pill, most women will have a normal period at the expected time. However, you may have your period later or earlier than normal. If your period is more than seven days late, or is unusually light or short, contact your GP as soon as possible to check for pregnancy. Who can use the emergency pill? Most women can use the emergency contraceptive pill. This includes women who cannot usually use hormonal contraception, such as the combined pill and contraceptive patch. Girls aged under 16 years old can also use the emergency contraceptive pill. Levonelle The WHO does not identify any medical condition that would mean a woman shouldn\u2019t use Levonelle. ellaOne The manufacturer of ellaOne advises that it should not be used by women who:  are allergic to any of the components of the drug have severe asthma that is treated with glucocorticoids (steroid) tablets have certain rare hereditary problems with lactose metabolism ellaOne may not be effective in women who are taking liver enzyme-inducing medication. For more information, read The emergency pill and other medicines. Breastfeeding Levonelle Levonelle can be taken while breastfeeding. Although small amounts of the hormones contained in the pill may pass into your breast milk, it is not thought to be harmful to your baby. ellaOne The safety of ellaOne during breastfeeding is not yet known. The manufacturer recommends that you do not breastfeed for one week after taking this pill. If you are already using the pill, patch, vaginal ring or contraceptive injection You may need to take the emergency pill if you: forgot to take some of your regular contraceptive pills, or did not use your contraceptive patch or vaginal ring correctly, or were late having your contraceptive implant or contraceptive injection If you have taken Levonelle, then you should:  take your next contraceptive pill, apply a new patch or insert a new ring within 12 hours of taking the emergency pill You should then continue taking your regular contraceptive pill as normal. You will need to use additional contraception, such as condoms, for: the next seven days if you use the patch, ring, combined pill (except Qlaira), implant or injection nine days for the combined pill Qlaira  the next two days if you use the progestogen-only pill If you have taken ellaOne, you will need to wait at least five days before taking your next contraceptive pill, applying a new patch or inserting a new ring. You should then use additional contraception, such as condoms, while waiting to restart your contraceptive method and then for: the next seven days if you use the patch, ring, combined pill (except Qlaira), implant or injection nine days for the combined pill Qlaira  the next two days if you use the progestogen-only pill What are the side effects of using the emergency pill? Taking the emergency contraceptive pill has not been shown to cause any serious or long-term health problems. However, it can sometimes have side effects. Common side effects include:  abdominal (tummy) pain headache irregular menstrual bleeding (spotting or heavy bleeding) before your next period is due feeling sick tiredness Less common side effects include: breast tenderness dizziness headache vomiting (seek medical advice if you vomit within two hours of taking Levonelle, or three hours of taking ellaOne, as you will need to take another dose or have an IUD fitted) If you are concerned about any symptoms after taking the emergency contraceptive pill, contact your GP or speak to a nurse at a sexual health clinic. You should talk to a doctor or nurse if:  you think you might be pregnant your next period is more than seven days late your period is shorter or lighter than usual you have any sudden or unusual pain in your lower abdomen (this could be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy, where a fertilised egg implants outside the womb \u2013 this is rare but serious, and needs immediate medical attention)  The emergency pill and other medicines The emergency contraceptive pill may interact with other medicines. These include:  the herbal medicine St John\u2019s Wort some medicines used to treat epilepsy some medicines used to treat HIV some medicines used to treat tuberculosis (TB) medication such as omeprazole (an antacid) to make your stomach less acidic ellaOne cannot be used if you are already taking one of these medicines, as it may not be effective. Levonelle may still be used, but the dose may need to be increased \u2013 your doctor or pharmacist can advise on this. There should be no interaction between the emergency pill and most antibiotics. Two enzyme-inducing antibiotics (called rifampicin and rifabutin), used to treat or prevent meningitis or TB, may affect ellaOne while they\u2019re being taken and for 28 days afterwards. If you want to check that your medicines are safe to take with the emergency contraceptive pill, ask your GP or a pharmacist. You should also read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicines.  Can I get the emergency contraceptive pill in advance? You may be able to get the emergency contraceptive pill in advance of having unprotected sex if: you are worried about your contraceptive method failing you are going on holiday you cannot get hold of emergency contraception easily Ask your GP or nurse for further information on getting advance emergency contraception. The IUD as emergency contraception An intrauterine device (IUD) How the IUD works How effective the IUD is at preventing pregnancy Who can use the IUD During pregnancy and breastfeeding Side effects of using the IUD  The IUD and other medicines How the IUD works The intrauterine device (IUD) is a small, T-shaped contraceptive device made from plastic and copper. It\u2019s inserted into the uterus by a trained health professional. It may prevent an egg from implanting in your womb or being fertilised. If you\u2019ve had unprotected sex, the IUD can be inserted up to five days afterwards, or up to five days after the earliest time you could have ovulated, to prevent pregnancy. It\u2019s more effective at preventing pregnancy than the emergency pill, and it does not interact with any other medication. You can also choose to have the IUD left in as an ongoing method of contraception. How effective is the IUD at preventing pregnancy? There are several types of IUD. Newer ones have more copper and are more than 99% effective. Fewer than two women in 100 who use a newer IUD over five years will get pregnant. IUDs with less copper in them are less effective than this, but are still effective. The IUD is more effective than the emergency pill at preventing pregnancy after unprotected sex. Who can use the IUD? Most women can use an IUD, including women who have never been pregnant and those who are HIV positive. Your GP or clinician will ask about your medical history to check if an IUD is suitable for you. You should not use an IUD if you have: an untreated STI or a pelvic infection certain abnormalities of the womb or cervix any unexplained bleeding from your vagina \u2013 for example, between periods or after sex Women who have a heart condition should consult their GP or cardiologist before having an IUD fitted. Pregnancy and breastfeeding The IUD should not be inserted if there is a risk that you may already be pregnant. The IUD can be used safely if you\u2019re breastfeeding, but the risk of complications during insertion is slightly higher. What are the side effects of the IUD Complications after having an IUD fitted are rare, but can include pain, infection, damage to the womb or expulsion (the IUD coming out of your womb). If you use the IUD as an ongoing method of regular contraception, it may make your periods longer, heavier or more painful. The IUD and other medicines The emergency IUD will not react with any other medication. Where can I get emergency contraception? You can get the emergency contraceptive pill and the IUD for free from: a GP surgery that provides contraception (some GP surgeries may not provide the IUD) a contraception clinic  a sexual health clinic (find sexual health services near you) some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics some young people's clinics (call 0300 123 7123) You can also get the emergency contraceptive pill free from: most pharmacies (find pharmacies near you)  some NHS walk-in centres and minor injuries units some Accident & Emergency departments The doctor or nurse you see may ask for the following information: when you have had unprotected sex in your current menstrual cycle the date of the first day of your last period and the usual length of your cycle details of any contraceptive failure (such as how many pills you may have missed, and when) if you've used any medications that may affect your contraception You can buy the emergency contraceptive pill from most pharmacies if you're aged 16 or over and from some organisations such as bpas or Marie Stopes. The cost varies, but it will be around £30 to £35. Contraception for the future If you're not using a regular method of contraception, you might consider doing so in order to lower the risk of unintended pregnancy. Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) offers the most reliable protection against pregnancy, and you don't have to think about it every day or each time you have sex. LARC methods are the: injection implant IUS IUD     Page last reviewed: 13\/01\/2015 Next review due: 13\/01\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: Female sterilisation A woman can get pregnant if a man\u2019s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is female sterilisation. At a glance: female sterilisation   How it works   Who can have it done   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks of female sterilisation   Where you can get it Female sterilisation is usually carried out under general anaesthetic, but can be carried out under local anaesthetic, depending on the method used. The surgery involves blocking or sealing the fallopian tubes, which link the ovaries to the womb (uterus).  This prevents the woman\u2019s eggs from reaching sperm and becoming fertilised. Eggs will still be released from the ovaries as normal, but they will be absorbed naturally into the woman's body.   At a glance: facts about female sterilisation In most cases, female sterilisation is more than 99% effective, and only one woman in 200 will become pregnant in her lifetime after having it done.  You don't have to think about it every day, or every time you have sex, so it doesn't interrupt or affect your sex life.  Sterilisation can be carried out at any stage of the menstrual cycle. It won't affect hormone levels. You'll still have periods after being sterilised. You will need to use contraception until the operation is done and until your next period or for three months afterwards (depending on the type of sterilisation). As with any surgery, there's a small risk of complications. These include internal bleeding, infection or damage to other organs.  There's a small risk that the operation won't work. Blocked tubes can rejoin immediately or years later.  If the operation fails, this may increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy (when a fertilised egg implants outside the womb, usually in a fallopian tube).  The sterilisation operation is difficult to reverse. Female sterilisation doesn't protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so always use a condom to protect yourself and your partner against them. How female sterilisation works Female sterilisation works by preventing eggs from travelling down the fallopian tubes. This means a woman's eggs cannot meet sperm, and fertilisation cannot happen. How female sterilisation is carried out  Before the operation Recovering after the operation How female sterilisation is carried out There are two main types of female sterilisation: when your fallopian tubes are blocked \u2013 for example, with clips or rings (tubal occlusion)   when implants are used to block your fallopian tubes (hysteroscopic sterilisation, or HS)  It can be a fairly minor operation, with many women returning home the same day. Sterilisation is usually carried out using tubal occlusion. Tubal occlusion First, your surgeon will need to access and examine your fallopian tubes, using either laparoscopy or mini-laparotomy. A laparoscopy is the most common method of accessing the fallopian tubes. The surgeon makes a small cut in your abdominal wall near your belly button and inserts a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a small flexible tube that contains a tiny light and camera. The camera relays images of the inside of your body to a television monitor. This allows the surgeon to see your fallopian tubes clearly. A mini-laparotomy involves a small incision, usually less than 5cm (2 inches), just above the pubic hairline. Your surgeon can then access your fallopian tubes through this incision. A laparoscopy is usually the preferred option because it is faster. However, a mini-laparotomy may be recommended for women who: have had recent abdominal or pelvic surgery are obese (have a body mass index of 30 or over)  have a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (a bacterial infection that can affect the womb and fallopian tubes) Blocking the tubes The fallopian tubes can be blocked using one of the following methods: applying clips \u2013 plastic or titanium clamps are closed over the fallopian tubes  applying rings \u2013 a small loop of the fallopian tube is pulled through a silicone ring, then clamped shut  tying and cutting the tube \u2013 this destroys 3-4cm (1-1.5 inches) of the tube Hysteroscopic sterilisation (fallopian implants) You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published guidance about hysteroscopic sterilisation. In the UK, the brand name of the hysteroscopic sterilisation technique is Essure. The procedure doesn't require cuts to be made in your abdomen so general anaesthetic is not required. Though you may be given a painkiller and \/or a local anaesthetic. A narrow tube with a telescope at the end, called a hysteroscope, is passed through your vagina and cervix. A guidewire is used to insert a tiny piece of titanium metal (called a microinsert) into the hysteroscope, then into each of your fallopian tubes. This means that the surgeon does not need to cut into your body. The implant causes the fallopian tube to form scar tissue around it, which eventually blocks the tube. You should carry on using contraception until an imaging test has confirmed that your fallopian tubes are blocked. This can be done with one or more of the following:  a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) \u2013 a type of X-ray that is taken after a special dye has been injected to show up any blockages in your fallopian tubes  a hysterosalpingo-contrast-sonography (HyCoSy) \u2013 a type of ultrasound scan involving injecting dye into your fallopian tubes The manufacturer of Essure now advises that ultrasound scan is an additional option for checking placement of the implants 3 months after the sterilisation procedure. If the coils of the implant are seen to be in the correct position tubal occlusion can be assumed Removing the tubes (salpingectomy) If blocking the fallopian tubes has been unsuccessful, the tubes may be completely removed. Removal of the tubes is called salpingectomy. Before the operation Your GP will strongly recommend counselling before referring you for sterilisation. Ideally, this should be with you and your partner if appropriate and acceptable. If possible, you should both agree to the procedure, but it is not a legal requirement to get your partner\u2019s permission. Counselling will give you a chance to talk about the operation in detail, and talk about any doubts, worries or questions that you might have. Your GP does have the right to refuse to carry out the procedure or refuse to refer you for the procedure if they do not believe that it is in your best interests. If this is the case, you may have to pay to have a sterilisation privately. If you decide to be sterilised, your GP will usually refer you to a specialist for treatment. This will usually be a gynaecologist at your nearest NHS hospital. A gynaecologist is a specialist in the female reproductive system. If you choose to have a sterilisation, you will be asked to use contraception until the day of the operation, and to continue using it:  until your next period if you are having your fallopian tubes blocked (tubal occlusion)   for around three months if you are having fallopian implants (hysteroscopic sterilisation) Sterilisation can be performed at any stage in your menstrual cycle. Before you have the operation, you will be given a pregnancy test to make sure that you are not pregnant. It is vital to know this because once the surgeon blocks your fallopian tubes, there is a high risk that any pregnancy will become ectopic (when the fertilised egg grows outside the womb, usually in the fallopian tubes). An ectopic pregnancy can be life-threatening because it can cause severe internal bleeding. Recovering after the operation Once you have recovered from the anaesthetic, passed urine and had something to eat, you will be allowed home. If you leave hospital within hours of the operation, ask a relative or friend to pick you up, or take a taxi. The healthcare professionals treating you in hospital will tell you what to expect and how to care for yourself after surgery. They may give you a contact number to call if you have any problems or any questions. If you have had a general anaesthetic, do not drive a car for 48 hours afterwards. This is because even if you feel fine, your reaction times and judgement may not be back to normal. How you will feel It is normal to feel unwell and a little uncomfortable for a few days if you have had a general anaesthetic, and you may have to rest for a couple of days. Depending on your general health and your job, you can normally return to work five days after tubal occlusion. However, you should avoid heavy lifting for about a week. You may have some slight vaginal bleeding. Use a sanitary towel rather than a tampon until this has gone. You may also feel some pain, similar to period pain. You may be prescribed painkillers for this. If the pain or bleeding gets worse, seek medical attention. Caring for your wound If you had tubal occlusion to block your fallopian tubes, you will have a wound with stitches where the surgeon made an incision (cut) into your stomach. Some stitches are dissolvable and disappear on their own, and some will need to be removed. If your stitches need removing, you will be given a follow-up appointment for this. If there is a dressing over your wound, you can normally remove this the day after your operation. After this, you will be able to have a bath or shower as normal. Having sex Your sex drive and enjoyment of sex will not be affected. You can have sex as soon as it is comfortable to do so after the operation. If you had tubal occlusion, you will need to use contraception until your first period to protect yourself from pregnancy. If you had hysteroscopic sterilisation, you will need to use another form of contraception for around three months after surgery. After scans have confirmed that the implants are in the correct position, you will no longer need contraception. Sterilisation will not protect you from STIs, so continue to use barrier contraception such as condoms if you are unsure of your partner's sexual health. Who can have it done? Almost any woman can be sterilised. However, sterilisation should only be considered by women who do not want any more children, or do not want children at all. Once you are sterilised it is very difficult to reverse the process, so it's important to consider the other options available before making your decision. Sterilisation reversal is not usually available on the NHS. Surgeons are more willing to perform sterilisation when women are over 30 years old and have had children, although some younger women who have never had a baby choose it. Advantages and disadvantages of female sterilisation Advantages female sterilisation can be more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy tubal occlusion (blocking the fallopian tubes) and removal of the tubes (salpingectomy) should be effective immediately \u2013 however, doctors strongly recommend that you continue to use contraception until your next period hysteroscopic sterilisation is usually effective after around three months \u2013 research collected by NICE found that the fallopian tubes were blocked after three months in 96% of sterilised women Other advantages of female sterilisation are that: there are rarely any long-term effects on your sexual health it will not affect your sex drive it will not affect the spontaneity of sexual intercourse or interfere with sex (as other forms of contraception can) it will not affect your hormone levels Disadvantages female sterilisation does not protect you against STIs, so you should still use a condom if you are unsure about your partner's sexual health  it is very difficult to reverse a tubal occlusion \u2013 this involves removing the blocked part of the fallopian tube and rejoining the ends, and reversal operations are rarely funded by the NHS a 2015 US study found that around 1 in 50 women who had a hysteroscopic sterilisation required further surgery due to complications such as persistent pain  Risks with tubal occlusion, there is a very small risk of complications, including internal bleeding and infection or damage to other organs it is possible for sterilisation to fail \u2013 the fallopian tubes can rejoin and make you fertile again, although this is rare (about one in 200 women become pregnant in their lifetime after being sterilised) if you do get pregnant after the operation, there is an increased risk that it will be an ectopic pregnancy (when the fertilised egg grows outside the womb, usually in the fallopian tubes) If you miss a period, take a pregnancy test immediately. If the pregnancy test is positive, you must see your GP so that you can be referred for a scan to check if the pregnancy is inside or outside your womb. With hysteroscopic sterilisation, there is a small risk of pregnancy even after your tubes have been blocked. Research collected by NICE has shown that possible complications after fallopian implants can include: pain after the operation \u2013 in one study, nearly eight out of 10 women reported pain afterwards the implants being inserted incorrectly \u2013 this affected two out of 100 women   bleeding after the operation \u2013 many women had light bleeding after the operation, and nearly a third had bleeding for three days Where to get contraception Most types of contraception are available free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. You can get contraception, and information and advice about contraception, at: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraceptive clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics  sexual health clinics \u2013 they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people\u2019s services (call 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic.  Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won't tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.   Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 05\/01\/2015 Next review due: 05\/01\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: IUD (intrauterine device) A woman can get pregnant if a man\u2019s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping eggs being produced. One method of contraception is the intrauterine device, or IUD (sometimes called a coil). At a glance: facts about the IUD   How the IUD works   Who can use the IUD   Advantages and disadvantages of the IUD   Risks of the IUD   Where you can get an IUD An IUD is a small T-shaped plastic and copper device that\u2019s inserted into your womb (uterus) by a specially trained doctor or nurse.  The IUD works by stopping the sperm and egg from surviving in the womb or fallopian tubes. It may also prevent a fertilised egg from implanting in the womb. The IUD is a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method. This means that once it's in place, you don't have to think about it each day or each time you have sex. There are several types and sizes of IUD. You can use an IUD whether or not you've had children.   At a glance: facts about the IUD There are different types of IUD, some with more copper than others. IUDs with more copper are more than 99% effective. This means that fewer than one in 100 women who use an IUD will get pregnant in one year. IUDs with less copper will be less effective.  An IUD works as soon as it's put in, and lasts for five to 10 years, depending on the type. It can be put in at any time during your menstrual cycle, as long as you're not pregnant. It can be removed at any time by a specially trained doctor or nurse and you'll quickly return to normal levels of fertility. Changes to your periods (for example, being heavier, longer or more painful) are common in the first three to six months after an IUD is put in, but they're likely to settle down after this. You might get spotting or bleeding between periods.  There's a very small chance of infection within 20 days of the IUD being fitted.  There's a risk that your body may expel the IUD. If you get pregnant, there's an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy (when the egg implants outside the womb). But because you're unlikely to get pregnant, the overall risk of ectopic pregnancy is lower than in women who don't use contraception.  Having the IUD put in can be uncomfortable. Ask the doctor or nurse about pain relief. An IUD may not be suitable for you if you've had previous pelvic infections. The IUD does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using condoms as well as the IUD, you'll help to protect yourself against STIs. How the IUD works How it prevents pregnancy Having an IUD fitted How to tell whether an IUD is still in place Removing an IUD How it prevents pregnancy The IUD is similar to the IUS (intrauterine system) but works in a different way. Instead of releasing the hormone progestogen like the IUS, the IUD releases copper. Copper changes the make-up of the fluids in the womb and fallopian tubes, stopping sperm surviving there. IUDs may also stop fertilised eggs from implanting in the womb. There are types and sizes of IUD to suit different women. IUDs need to be fitted by a trained doctor or nurse at your GP surgery, local contraception clinic or sexual health clinic. An IUD can stay in the womb for five to 10 years, depending on the type. If you're 40 or over when you have an IUD fitted, it can be left in until you reach the menopause or until you no longer need contraception. Having an IUD fitted An IUD can be fitted at any time during your menstrual cycle, as long as you are not pregnant. You'll be protected against pregnancy straight away. Before you have an IUD fitted, you will have an internal examination to find out the size and position of your womb. This is to make sure that the IUD can be put in the correct place. You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you You may also be tested for infections, such as STIs. It's best to do this before an IUD is fitted so that you can have treatment (if you need it) before the IUD is put in. Sometimes, you may be given antibiotics at the same time as the IUD is fitted. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to insert an IUD. The vagina is held open, like it is during a cervical screening (smear) test, and the IUD is inserted through the cervix and into the womb. The fitting process can be uncomfortable and sometimes painful. You may get cramps afterwards. You can ask for a local anaesthetic or painkillers before having the IUD fitted. An anaesthetic injection itself can be painful, so many women have the procedure without. You may get pain and bleeding for a few days after having an IUD fitted. Discuss this with your GP or nurse beforehand.   The IUD needs to be checked by a doctor after three to six weeks. Speak to your doctor or nurse if you have any problems before or after this first check or if you want the IUD removed. Speak to your doctor or nurse if you or your partner are at risk of getting an STI. This is because STIs can lead to an infection in the pelvis. See your GP or go back to the clinic where your IUD was fitted as soon as you can if you: have pain in your lower abdomen have a high temperature have a smelly discharge These may mean you have an infection. How to tell whether an IUD is still in place An IUD has two thin threads that hang down a little way from your womb into the top of your vagina. The doctor or nurse who fits your IUD will teach you how to feel for these threads and check that it is still in place. Check your IUD is in place a few times in the first month, and then after each period or at regular intervals.  It's very unlikely that your IUD will come out, but if you can't feel the threads, or if you think the IUD has moved, you may not be fully protected against getting pregnant. See your doctor or nurse straight away and use an extra method of contraception, such as condoms, until your IUD has been checked. If you've had sex recently, you may need to use emergency contraception. Your partner shouldn't be able to feel your IUD during sex. If he can feel the threads, get your doctor or nurse to check that your IUD is in place. They may be able to cut the threads to a shorter length. If you feel any pain during sex, go for a check-up. Removing an IUD An IUD can be removed at any time by a trained doctor or nurse. If you're not going to have another IUD put in and you don't want to get pregnant, use another method (such as condoms) for seven days before you have the IUD removed. This is to stop sperm getting into your body. Sperm can live for up to seven days in the body and could make you pregnant once the IUD is removed. As soon as an IUD is taken out, your normal fertility should return.  Who can use an IUD Most women can use an IUD. This includes women who have never been pregnant and those who are HIV positive. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your medical history to check if an IUD is the most suitable form of contraception for you. You should not use an IUD if you have: an untreated STI or a pelvic infection  problems with your womb or cervix  any unexplained bleeding from your vagina \u2013 for example, between periods or after sex Women who have had an ectopic pregnancy or recent abortion, or who have an artificial heart valve, must consult their GP or clinician before having an IUD fitted. You should not be fitted with an IUD if there's a chance that you are already pregnant or if you or your partner are at risk of catching STIs. If you or your partner are unsure, go to your GP or a sexual health clinic to be tested. Using an IUD after giving birth An IUD can usually be fitted four to six weeks after giving birth (vaginal or caesarean). You'll need to use alternative contraception from three weeks (21 days) after the birth until the IUD is fitted. In some cases, an IUD can be fitted within 48 hours of giving birth. An IUD is safe to use when you're breastfeeding and it won't affect your milk supply. Using an IUD after a miscarriage or abortion An IUD can be fitted straight away or within 48 hours after an abortion or miscarriage by an experienced doctor or nurse, as long as you were pregnant for less than 24 weeks. If you were pregnant for more than 24 weeks, you may have to wait a few weeks before having an IUD fitted.  Advantages and disadvantages of the IUD Although an IUD is an effective method of contraception, there are some things to consider before having one fitted. Advantages of the IUD Most women can use an IUD, including women who have never been pregnant. Once an IUD is fitted, it works straight away and lasts for up to 10 years or until it's removed. It doesn't interrupt sex. It can be used if you're breastfeeding. Your normal fertility returns as soon as the IUD is taken out It's not affected by other medicines. There's no evidence that having an IUD fitted will increase the risk of cancer of the cervix, endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the womb) or ovarian cancer. Some women experience changes in mood and libido, but these changes are very small. There is no evidence that the IUD affects weight. Disadvantages of the IUD Your periods may become heavier, longer or more painful, though this may improve after a few months.  An IUD doesn't protect against STIs, so you may have to use condoms as well. If you get an STI while you have an IUD, it could lead to a pelvic infection if not treated. The most common reasons that women stop using an IUD are vaginal bleeding and pain. Risks of the IUD Complications after having an IUD fitted are rare. Most will appear within the first year after fitting. Damage to the womb In fewer than one in 1,000 cases, an IUD can perforate (make a hole in) the womb or neck of the womb (cervix) when it's put in. This can cause pain in the lower abdomen, but doesn't usually cause any other symptoms. If the doctor or nurse fitting your IUD is experienced, the risk of this is very low. If perforation occurs, you may need surgery to remove the IUD. Contact your GP straight away if you feel a lot of pain after having an IUD fitted as perforations should be treated immediately. Pelvic infections Pelvic infections can occur in the first 20 days after the IUD is fitted. The risk of infection is very small. Fewer than one in 100 women who are at low risk of STIs will get a pelvic infection. Rejection Occasionally, the IUD is rejected (expelled) by the womb or can move (this is called displacement). This is more likely to happen soon after it has been fitted, although this is uncommon. Your doctor or nurse will teach you how to check that your IUD is in place. Ectopic pregnancy If the IUD fails and you become pregnant, your IUD should be removed as soon as possible if you're going to continue with the pregnancy. There's a small increased risk of ectopic pregnancy if a woman becomes pregnant while using an IUD. Where to get an IUD Most types of contraception are available free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics sexual health clinics \u2013 these offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people\u2019s services (call the sexual health line on 0300 123 7123 for details) Find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching your postcode or town. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacists won't tell your parents or carer, as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.   Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 12\/01\/2015 Next review due: 12\/01\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the IUS, or intrauterine system (sometimes called the hormonal coil). At a glance: facts about the IUS   How the IUS works   Who can use the IUS   Advantages and disadvantages of the IUS   Risks of the IUS   Where to get the IUS An IUS is a small, T-shaped plastic device that is inserted into your womb (uterus) by a specially trained doctor or nurse. The IUS releases a progestogen hormone into the womb. This thickens the mucus from your cervix, making it difficult for sperm to move through and reach an egg. It also thins the womb lining so that it's less likely to accept a fertilised egg. It may also stop ovulation (the release of an egg) in some women. The IUS is a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method. It works for five years or three years, depending on the type, so you don't have to think about contraception every day or each time you have sex. Two brands of IUS are used in the UK \u2013 Mirena and Jaydess.  You can use an IUS whether or not you've had children. At a glance: facts about the IUS   It's more than 99% effective. Less than one in every 100 women who use Mirena will get pregnant in five years, and less than one in 100 who use Jaydess will get pregnant in three years. It can be taken out at any time by a specially trained doctor or nurse and your fertility quickly returns to normal. The IUS can make your periods lighter, shorter or stop altogether, so it may help women who have heavy periods or painful periods. Jaydess is less likely than Mirena to make your periods stop altogether. It can be used by women who can't use combined contraception (such as the combined pill) \u2013 for example, those who have migraines. Once the IUS is in place, you don't have to think about contraception every day or each time you have sex. Some women may experience mood swings, skin problems or breast tenderness.   There's a small risk of getting an infection after it's inserted. It can be uncomfortable when the IUS is put in, although painkillers can help with this. The IUS can be fitted at any time during your monthly menstrual cycle, as long as you're definitely not pregnant. Ideally, it should be fitted within seven days of the start of your period, because this will protect against pregnancy straight away. You should use condoms for seven days if the IUS is fitted at any other time. The IUS does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using condoms as well as the IUS, you'll help to protect yourself against STIs.   How the IUS works How it prevents pregnancy  Having an IUS fitted How to tell whether an IUS is still in place Removing an IUS How it prevents pregnancy The IUS is similar to the IUD (intrauterine device), but works in a slightly different way. Rather than releasing copper like the IUD, the IUS releases a progestogen hormone, which is similar to the natural hormone progesterone that's produced in a woman's ovaries. Progestogen thickens the mucus from the cervix (opening of the womb), making it harder for sperm to move through it and reach an egg. It also causes the womb lining to become thinner and less likely to accept a fertilised egg. In some women, the IUS also stops the ovaries from releasing an egg (ovulation), but most women will continue to ovulate. If you're 45 or older when you have the IUS fitted, it can be left until you reach menopause or you no longer need contraception. Having an IUS fitted You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you An IUS can be fitted at any stage of your menstrual cycle, as long as you are not pregnant. If it's fitted in the first seven days of your cycle, you will be protected against pregnancy straight away. If it's fitted at any other time, you need to use another method of contraception (such as condoms) for seven days after it's fitted. Before you have an IUS fitted, you will have an internal examination to determine the size and position of your womb. This is to make sure that the IUS can be positioned in the correct place. You may also be tested for any existing infections, such as STIs. It is best to do this before an IUS is fitted so that any infections can be treated. You may be given antibiotics at the same time as an IUS is fitted. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to insert an IUS: the vagina is held open, like it is during a cervical screening (smear) test the IUS is inserted through the cervix and into the womb The fitting process can be uncomfortable or painful for some women, and you may also experience cramps afterwards. You can ask for a local anaesthetic or painkillers before having the IUS fitted. Discuss this with your GP or nurse beforehand. An anaesthetic injection itself can be painful, so many women have the procedure without one. Once an IUS is fitted, it will need to be checked by a doctor after three to six weeks to make sure everything is fine. Speak to your GP or clinician if you have any problems after this initial check or if you want the IUS removed. Also speak to your GP if you or your partner are at risk of getting an STI, as this can lead to infection in the pelvis. See your GP or go back to the clinic if you: have pain in your lower abdomen have a high temperature have smelly discharge This may mean you have an infection. How to tell if an IUS is still in place An IUS has two thin threads that hang down a little way from your womb into the top of your vagina. The GP or clinician that fits your IUS will teach you how to feel for these threads and check that the IUS is still in place. Check your IUS is in place a few times in the first month and then after each period at regular intervals. It is highly unlikely that your IUS will come out, but if you can't feel the threads or if you think the IUS has moved, you may not be fully protected against pregnancy. See your doctor or nurse straight away and use extra contraception, such as condoms, until your IUS has been checked. If you've had sex recently, you may need to use emergency contraception. Your partner shouldn't be able to feel your IUS during sex. If he can feel the threads, get your GP or clinician to check that your IUS is in place. They may be able to cut the threads a little. If you feel any pain during sex, go for a check-up with your GP or clinician. Removing an IUS Your IUS can be removed at any time by a trained doctor or nurse. If you're not going to have another IUS put in and you don't want to become pregnant, use another contraceptive method (such as condoms) for seven days before you have the IUS removed. Sperm can live for seven days in the body and could fertilise an egg once the IUS is removed. As soon as an IUS is taken out, your normal fertility should return. Who can use an IUS Most women can use an IUS, including women who have never been pregnant and those who are HIV positive. Your GP or clinician will ask about your medical history to check if an IUS is the most suitable form of contraception for you. Your family and medical history will determine whether or not you can use an IUS. For example, this method of contraception may not be suitable for you if you have: breast cancer, or have had it in the past five years cervical cancer  liver disease unexplained vaginal bleeding between periods or after sex arterial disease or history of serious heart disease or stroke an untreated STI or pelvic infection problems with your womb or cervix An IUS may not be suitable for women who have untreated STIs. A doctor will usually give you a check-up to make sure you don't have any existing infections. Using an IUS after giving birth An IUS can usually be fitted four to six weeks after giving birth (vaginal or caesarean). You'll need to use alternative contraception from three weeks (21 days) after the birth until the IUS is put in. In some cases, an IUS can be fitted within 48 hours of giving birth. It is safe to use an IUS when you're breastfeeding, and it won't affect your milk supply. Using an IUS after a miscarriage or abortion An IUS can be fitted by an experienced doctor or nurse straight after an abortion or miscarriage, as long as you were pregnant for less than 24 weeks. If you were pregnant for more than 24 weeks, you may have to wait a few weeks before an IUS can be fitted. Advantages and disadvantages of the IUS Although an IUS is an effective method of contraception, there are several things to consider before having an IUS fitted. Advantages of the IUS It works for five years (Mirena) or three years (Jaydess).  It's one of the most effective forms of contraception available in the UK. It doesn't interrupt sex. An IUS may be useful if you have heavy or painful periods because your periods usually become much lighter and shorter, and sometimes less painful \u2013 they may stop completely after the first year of use. It can be used safely if you're breastfeeding.  It's not affected by other medicines. It may be a good option if you can't take the hormone oestrogen, which is used in the combined contraceptive pill.  Your fertility will return to normal when the IUS is removed. There's no evidence that an IUS will affect your weight or that having an IUS fitted will increase the risk of cervical cancer, cancer of the uterus or ovarian cancer. Some women experience changes in mood and libido, but these changes are very small. Disadvantages of the IUS Some women won't be happy with the way that their periods may change. For example, periods may become lighter and more irregular or, in some cases, stop completely. Your periods are more likely to stop completely with Mirena than with Jaydess. Irregular bleeding and spotting are common in the first six months after having an IUS fitted. This is not harmful and usually decreases with time. Some women experience headaches, acne and breast tenderness after having the IUS fitted. An uncommon side effect of the IUS is the appearance of small fluid-filled cysts on the ovaries \u2013 these usually disappear without treatment. An IUS doesn't protect you against STIs, so you may also have to use condoms when having sex. If you get an STI while you have an IUS fitted, it could lead to pelvic infection if it's not treated. Most women who stop using an IUS do so because of vaginal bleeding and pain, although this is uncommon. Hormonal problems can also occur, but these are even less common. Risks of the IUS Complications caused by an IUS are rare and usually happen in the first six months after it has been fitted. These include: Damage to the womb In rare cases (fewer than one in 1,000 insertions) an IUS can perforate (make a hole in) the womb or neck of the womb (cervix) when it is put in. This can cause pain in the lower abdomen, but doesn't usually cause any other symptoms. If the doctor or nurse fitting your IUS is experienced, the risk of perforation is extremely low. If perforation occurs, you may need surgery to remove the IUS. Contact your GP straight away if you feel a lot of pain after having an IUS fitted. Perforations should be treated immediately. Pelvic infections Pelvic infections may occur in the first 20 days after the IUS has been inserted. The risk of infection from an IUS is extremely small (fewer than one in 100 women who are at low risk of STIs will get an infection). A GP or clinician will usually recommend an internal examination before fitting an IUS to be sure that there are no existing infections. Rejection Occasionally, the IUS is rejected (expelled) by the womb or it can move (this is called displacement). This is not common and is more likely to happen soon after it has been fitted. Your doctor or nurse will teach you how to check that your IUS is in place. Ectopic pregnancy If the IUS fails and you become pregnant, your IUS should be removed as soon as possible if you are continuing with the pregnancy. There's a small increased risk of ectopic pregnancy if a woman becomes pregnant while using an IUS. Where to get the IUS Most types of contraception are available for free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics sexual health clinics \u2013 they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people\u2019s services (call 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find sexual health services near you, including contraception clinics. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won't tell your parents or carer as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: What is the male pill? In the past 50 years, there have been few changes in male contraception compared with the range of options available to women. Today, the only contraceptive methods available to men are: condoms \u2013 a barrier form of contraception that stops sperm reaching and fertilising an egg vasectomy \u2013 a minor surgical procedure that stops sperm being ejaculated from the penis during sex (it is usually permanent)  Some men use withdrawal to try to prevent pregnancy, when they pull their penis out of their partner's vagina before ejaculating. However, this is not a recommended method of contraception. Sperm can be released from the penis before ejaculation. Ongoing research There are many ongoing research projects into different methods of male contraception. Researchers are optimistic that a safe, effective and reversible method of male contraception will eventually become a reality, although this is still several years away.  Types of research There are two main areas of research into male contraception: hormonal contraception \u2013 where synthetic (man-made) hormones are used to temporarily stop the development of healthy sperm non-hormonal methods \u2013 where other techniques are used to prevent healthy sperm from entering a woman's vagina Hormonal contraception In fertile men, new sperm cells are constantly created in the testicles. This process is triggered by the hormone testosterone. The goal of hormonal contraception research is to find a way of temporarily blocking the effects of testosterone so testicles stop producing healthy sperm cells. However, this needs to be achieved without lowering testosterone levels to such an extent that it triggers side effects, such as a loss of sexual desire. Synthetic testosterone and other steroid combinations One way of doing this is by giving men a synthetic version of testosterone, together with a hormone called progestogen. Progestogens are synthetic versions of a female sex hormone often found in female hormonal contraceptives, such as the progestogen-only pill.  This approach stops the testes producing testosterone which, in most cases, prevents normal sperm production. However, at the same time it keeps the amount of testosterone in the blood normal, preventing side effects. This is a very effective approach, but some men still carry on producing enough sperm to cause a pregnancy. The reason why this happens is unknown, but it may be that some men carry on producing enough testosterone to continue to stimulate some sperm production. Research is now focusing on different combinations of synthetic testosterone and progestogens. Several trials in different countries are looking at the effectiveness and long-term safety of hormonal contraceptives for men, including some phase III trials. Phase III trials are the last clinical trials carried out before a medicine is given a marketing licence. An important disadvantage of using synthetic testosterone is that sperm production is suppressed at different rates in men of different ethnic origins. These differences may be due to genetic, dietary or environmental factors, but the exact reasons are unknown. Understanding the reasons may lead to new ways of providing effective contraception for all men of diverse ethnic backgrounds. Non-hormonal contraception Many of the non-hormonal methods of contraception currently being studied involve the vas deferens. The vas deferens is the tube that sperm pass through on their way to the penis. This tube is cut during a vasectomy. RISUG and the IVD   One promising avenue of research is a technique called reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG). During this technique, a non-toxic synthetic chemical is injected into the vas deferens. The chemical reacts and blocks the vas deferens. It also kills sperm when they come into contact with it. The chemical is effective almost immediately after it is injected. The chemical stays in place until a man decides that he wants to have children. It can then be washed out using another injection which dissolves and flushes it out of the vas deferens. A variation of this technique is the intra-vas device (IVD). It involves injecting a \"plug\" into the vas deferens which can be removed later. The IVD filters out the sperm as it passes through the vas deferens.  Initial results of RISUG and IVD are promising, but further research is needed to assess the long-term effectiveness and safety of both techniques. Reasearch published in 2013 found that blocking certain proteins in the bodies of male mice rendered them infertile, but did not affect their sexual behaviour or the quality of their sperm. It prevented the sperm cells from being launched during ejaculation. When the mice's sperm was used to artificially inseminate female mice, it resulted in pregnancies and healthy baby mice. If a way can be found to block these proteins in human males, this may take research a step closer to producing a male contraceptive pill. However, the research is in the very early stages and a male pill has not been developed. You can find out more about the research into proteins, mice and sperm.   Epididymis Other research is focusing on the epididymis. This is a long, coiled tube behind the testicles that allows sperm to mature normally, which is essential for normal fertility. Attempts have been made to interfere with the way the epididymis works and the way sperm matures inside the epididymis. However, so far neither approach has been successful.  Page last reviewed: 06\/11\/2014 Next review due: 06\/11\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: The progestogen-only pill A woman can get pregnant if a man\u2019s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the progestogen-only pill (POP). At a glance: the progestogen-only pill   How it works   Who can use it What to do if you miss a pill   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks It contains the hormone progestogen but doesn't contain oestrogen. You need to take the progestogen-only pill at or around the same time every day. The progestogen-only pill thickens the mucus in the cervix, which stops sperm reaching an egg. In can also stop ovulation, depending on the type of progestogen-only pill you take. Newer progestogen-only pills contain desogestrel. At a glance: facts about the progestogen-only pill If taken correctly, it can be more than 99% effective. This means that fewer than one woman in 100 who use the progestogen-only pill as contraception will get pregnant in one year. You take a pill every day, with no break between packs of pills. The progestogen-only pill can be used by women who can't use contraception that contains oestrogen \u2013 for example, because they have high blood pressure, previous blood clots or are overweight.  You can take the progestogen-only pill if you're over 35 and you smoke. You must take the progestogen-only pill at the same time each day \u2013 if you take it more than three hours late (or 12 hours late if you take a desogestrel pill, such as Cerazette) it may not be effective.  If you\u2019re sick (vomit) or have severe diarrhoea, the progestogen-only pill may not work.  Some medicines may affect the progestogen-only pill's effectiveness \u2013 ask your doctor for details.  Your periods may stop or become lighter, irregular or more frequent.  Side effects may include spotty skin and breast tenderness \u2013 these should clear up within a few months.  The progestogen-only pill doesn\u2019t protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using condoms as well as the progestogen-only pill, you'll help to protect yourself against STIs. How the progestogen-only pill works How it prevents pregnancy Using the progestogen-only pill Starting the first pack of pills How it prevents pregnancy The progestogen-only pill works by thickening the mucus in the neck of the womb, so it is harder for sperm to penetrate into the womb and reach an egg. Sometimes, depending on the type of progestogen-only pill, it may also prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from your ovaries each month). The desogestrel pill (12-hour pill, such as Cerazette) stops ovulation in 97% of menstrual cycles. This means that if you're using a 12-hour progestogen-only pill, you won't release an egg in 97 cycles out of 100. Using the progestogen-only pill There are two different types of progestogen-only pill: The three-hour progestogen-only pill must be taken within three hours of the same time each day. Examples are Femulen, Micronor, Norgeston and Noriday. The 12-hour progestogen-only pill (desogestrel pill, such as Cerazette) must be taken within 12 hours of the same time each day.  It is important to follow the instructions that come with your pill packet, because missing pills or taking the pill alongside other medicines can reduce its effectiveness. There are 28 pills in a pack of progestogen-only pills. You need to take one pill every day, within either three or 12 hours of the same time each day, depending on which type you are taking. There\u2019s no break between packs of pills \u2013 when you finish one pack, you start the next one the next day. Starting the first pack of pills Choose a convenient time in the day to take your first pill. Continue to take a pill at the same time each day until the pack is finished.  Start your next pack of pills the following day. There is no break between packs of pills. You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you You can start the progestogen-only pill at any time in your menstrual cycle. If you start it on day one of your menstrual cycle (the first day of your period) it will work straight away and you will be protected against pregnancy. You won\u2019t need additional contraception. If you start the progestogen-only pill on day five of your menstrual cycle or earlier (the fifth day after the start of your period or before) you will be protected from pregnancy straight away unless you have a short menstrual cycle (your period is every 23 days or less). If you have a short menstrual cycle, you will need additional contraception, such as condoms, until you have taken the pill for two days. If you start the progestogen-only pill on any other day of your cycle, you will not be protected from pregnancy straight away and will need additional contraception until you have taken the pill for two days. After having a baby If you have just had a baby, you can start the progestogen-only pill on day 21 after the birth. You will be protected against pregnancy straight away. If you start the progestogen-only pill more than 21 days after giving birth, you will need additional contraception (such as condoms) until you have taken the pill for two days. After a miscarriage or abortion If you have had a miscarriage or abortion, you can start the progestogen-only pill up to five days afterwards and you will be protected from pregnancy straight away. If you start the pill more than five days after a miscarriage or abortion, use additional contraception until you have taken the pill for two days. What to do if you miss a pill If you forget to take a progestogen-only pill, what you should do depends on:  the type of pill you are taking  how long ago you missed the pill and how many pills you have forgotten to take whether you have had sex without using another form of contraception during the previous seven days If you are less than three or less than 12 hours late taking the pill If you are taking a three-hour progestogen-only pill and are less than three hours late taking it, or if you are taking the 12-hour progestogen-only pill and are less than 12 hours late: take the late pill as soon as you remember, and  take the remaining pills as normal, even if that means taking two pills on the same day The pill will still work, and you\u2019ll be protected against pregnancy \u2013 you do not need to use additional contraception. Don\u2019t worry if you have had sex without using another form of contraception. You do not need emergency contraception. If you are more than three or more than 12 hours late taking the pill If you are taking a three-hour progestogen-only pill and are more than three hours late taking it, or are taking the 12-hour progestogen-only pill and are more than 12 hours late you will not be protected against pregnancy. You will need to use additional contraception, such as condoms for two or seven days (depending on what pill you are taking) after missing a pill. You should: take the last pill you missed straight away (if you have missed more than one, take only one) take your next pill at the normal time Depending on when you remember, it may mean taking two pills on the same day (one at the time of remembering, and one at the regular time), or even at the same time. How long you need to use additional contraception such as condoms depends on the type of pill you are taking: If you are taking a three-hour pill (such as Femulen, Micronor, Norgeston or Noriday) you will need to use additional contraception for two days after missing the pill. It takes two days for the pill's contraceptive effect on cervical mucus to be re-established after missing a pill. If you are taking a 12-hour pill that stops ovulation (a desogestrel pill, such as Cerazette), you will need additional contraception for seven days. This is because it takes seven days for the pill's effect on ovulation to be re-established after a missed pill. Emergency contraception If you have recently had unprotected sex, you may need emergency contraception. Seek advice straight away from your GP or local sexual health clinic. You can also call NHS 111 or the Sexual Health Line on 0300 123 7123. Vomiting and diarrhoea If you vomit within two hours of taking a progestogen-only pill, it may not have been fully absorbed into your bloodstream. Take another pill straight away and the next pill at your usual time. If you don\u2019t take the replacement within three hours (or 12 hours for the 12-hour pill) of your normal time, use additional contraception, such as condoms, for two days (seven days for the 12-hour pill). If you continue to be sick, keep using another form of contraception while you\u2019re ill and for two days after recovering. Very severe diarrhoea (six to eight watery stools in 24 hours) may also mean that the pill doesn\u2019t work properly. Keep taking your pill as normal, but use additional contraception, such as condoms, while you have diarrhoea and for two days after recovering (seven days if you are taking a 12-hour pill). Speak to your GP or contraception nurse or call NHS 111 or the Sexual Health Line on 0300123 7123 if you are unsure whether you are protected against pregnancy, or if your sickness or diarrhoea continues. Who can use the progestogen-only pill? Most women can use the progestogen-only pill. You may not be able to use it if you have had: heart disease  liver disease  breast cancer  cysts on your ovaries unexplained vaginal bleeding If you are healthy and there are no medical reasons why you should not take the progestogen-only pill, you can take it until your menopause or until you are 55. Breastfeeding The progestogen-only pill is safe to use if you are breastfeeding. Small amounts of progestogen may pass into your breast milk, but this is not harmful to your baby. The progestogen-only pill does not affect the way your breast milk is produced. Pregnancy Although it is very unlikely, there is a very small chance that you could become pregnant while taking the progestogen-only pill. If this happens, there is no evidence that the pill will harm your unborn baby. If you think you may be pregnant, speak to your GP or visit your local contraception clinic. Get medical advice if you have a sudden or unusual pain in your abdomen (tummy), or if your period is much shorter or lighter than usual. It is possible that these are warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy, although this is rare. Advantages and disadvantages Some advantages of the progestogen-only pill include: it does not interrupt sex  you can use it when breastfeeding  it is useful if you cannot take the hormone oestrogen, which is in the combined pill, contraceptive patch and vaginal ring you can use it at any age \u2013 even if you smoke and are over 35 it can reduce the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and painful periods Some disadvantages of the progestogen-only pill include: you may not have regular periods while taking it \u2013 your periods may be lighter, more frequent or may stop altogether, and you may get spotting between periods it does not protect you against STIs you need to remember to take it at or around the same time every day  some medications, including certain types of antibiotic, can make it less effective The progestogen-only pill is generally well tolerated and side effects are rare. Some side effects can include:  acne  breast tenderness and breast enlargement  an increased or decreased sex drive  mood changes  headache and migraine nausea or vomiting  cysts (small fluid-filled sacs) on your ovaries (these are usually harmless and disappear without treatment)  stomach upset  weight gain These side effects are most likely to occur during the first few months of taking the progestogen-only pill, but they generally improve over time and should stop within a few months. If you have any concerns about your contraceptive pill, see your GP or practice nurse. They may advise you to change to another pill or a different form of contraception. The progestogen-only pill with other medicines When you take two or more medicines at the same time, the effects of one medicine can be changed by the other. This is known as an interaction. Some medicines interact with the progestogen-only pill and it doesn\u2019t work properly. Some interactions are listed on this page but it is not a complete list \u2013 if you want to check your medicines are safe to take with the progestogen-only pill, you can:  ask your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine Antibiotics The antibiotics rifampicin and rifabutin (which can be used to treat illnesses including tuberculosis and meningitis) can reduce the effectiveness of the progestogen-only pill. Other antibiotics do not have this effect. If you are prescribed rifampicin or rifabutin, you may need additional contraception (such as condoms) while taking the antibiotic and for 28 days after. Speak to your doctor or nurse for advice. Epilepsy and HIV medicines, and St John\u2019s wort The progestogen-only pill can interact with medicines called enzyme inducers. These speed up the breakdown of progestogen by your liver, reducing the effectiveness of the progestogen-only pill. Examples of enzyme inducers are: the epilepsy drugs carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone and topiramate  St John\u2019s wort (a herbal remedy)  some antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV (research suggests interactions between these medicines and the progestogen-only pill can affect the safety and effectiveness of both) Your GP or nurse may advise you to use an alternative or additional form of contraception while taking any of these medicines. Risks of taking the progestogen-only pill The progestogen-only pill is very safe to take. However, as with the combined contraceptive pill, there are certain risks. These risks are small. For most women, benefits of the progestogen-only pill outweigh the risks. Ovarian cysts Some women can develop fluid-filled cysts on their ovaries. These are not dangerous and do not usually need to be removed. These cysts usually disappear without treatment. In many cases, the cysts do not cause symptoms, although some women experience pelvic pain. Breast cancer Research is continuing into the link between breast cancer and the progestogen-only pill. Research suggests that women who use any type of hormonal contraception have a slightly higher chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer compared with people who don\u2019t use hormonal contraception. However, 10 years after you stop taking the pill, your risk of breast cancer goes back to normal. If you have a family history of breast cancer, you may feel that this increase in risk (however small it is) is not worth taking. However, doctors do not think that using the contraceptive pill is likely to increase the risk in women who already have close relatives with breast cancer. Where you can get the progestogen-only pill Most types of contraception are available for free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics  some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics  sexual health clinics \u2013 they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services  some young people\u2019s services (call 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching by postcode or town. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won't tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.  Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 29\/12\/2014 Next review due: 29\/12\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is vasectomy (male sterilisation). At a glance: vasectomy   How vasectomy works   Who can have a vasectomy   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks   Common questions During a minor operation, the tubes that carry sperm from a man's testicles to the penis are cut, blocked or sealed. This prevents sperm from reaching the seminal fluid (semen), which is ejaculated from the penis during sex. There will be no sperm in the semen, so a woman's egg can't be fertilised.   Vasectomy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic, and takes about 15 minutes. At a glance: facts about vasectomy In most cases, vasectomy is more than 99% effective. Out of 2,000 men who are sterilised, one will get a woman pregnant during the rest of his lifetime. Male sterilisation is considered permanent \u2013 once it's done, you don't have to think about contraception again. You need to use contraception for at least eight weeks after the operation, because sperm stay in the tubes leading to the penis. Up to two semen tests are done after the operation, to ensure that all the sperm have gone.  Your scrotum (ball sack) may become bruised, swollen or painful \u2013 some men have ongoing pain in their testicles. As with any surgery, there's a slight risk of infection.  Reversing the operation isn't easy, and is rarely available on the NHS. Vasectomy doesn't protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using a condom, you\u2019ll protect yourself and your partner against STIs.  How vasectomy works Vasectomy works by stopping sperm from getting into a man\u2019s semen. This means that when a man ejaculates, the semen has no sperm and a woman\u2019s egg cannot be fertilised. How vasectomy is carried out  Conventional vasectomy No-scalpel vasectomy Before you decide to have a vasectomy How long will I have to wait for the operation? Recovering after the operation How will I know if the vasectomy has worked? Is reversal possible? How vasectomy is carried out Vasectomy is a quick and relatively painless surgical procedure. The tubes that carry sperm from a man's testicles to the penis are cut, blocked or sealed with heat. In most cases, you will be able to return home the same day. Most vasectomies are carried out under local anaesthetic. This means that only your scrotum and testicles will be numbed, and you will be awake for the procedure. You will not feel any pain, although it may feel slightly uncomfortable. In rare cases, a general anaesthetic may be required. This means that you will be asleep during the procedure. A general anaesthetic may be used if you are allergic to local anaesthetic or have a history of fainting easily. However, most people will only need a local anaesthetic. A vasectomy has no effect on sex drive or ability to enjoy sex. You will still have erections and ejaculate normally. The only difference is that your semen will not contain sperm.  A vasectomy can be performed at: your local GP surgery a hospital as a day-patient appointment a sexual health clinic a private clinic   There are two types of vasectomy. The traditional technique, called conventional vasectomy, involves making two small incisions in the scrotum (the pouch of skin that surrounds your testicles) using a scalpel (surgical knife). The other type, called a no-scalpel vasectomy, is a newer technique now in common use. The doctor doing your vasectomy will discuss with you which is best. Conventional vasectomy During a conventional vasectomy, the skin of your scrotum is numbed with local anaesthetic. The doctor makes two small cuts, about 1cm long, on each side of your scrotum. The incisions allow your surgeon to access the tubes that carry sperm out of your testicles. These tubes are known as \"vas deferens\". Each tube is cut and a small section removed. The ends of the tubes are then closed, either by tying them or sealing them using diathermy (an instrument that heats to a very high temperature). The incisions are stitched, usually using dissolvable stitches, which will disappear naturally within about a week. No-scalpel vasectomy You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you No-scalpel vasectomy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic. During a no-scalpel vasectomy, the doctor will feel the vas deferens underneath the skin of your scrotum and then hold them in place using a small clamp. A special instrument is then used to make a tiny puncture hole in the skin of the scrotum. A small pair of forceps is used to open up the hole, allowing the surgeon to access the vas deferens without needing to cut the skin with a scalpel. The tubes are then closed in the same way as in a conventional vasectomy, either by being tied or sealed. During a no-scalpel vasectomy, there will be little bleeding and no stitches. The procedure is also thought to be less painful and less likely to cause complications than a conventional vasectomy. Before you decide to have a vasectomy Your doctor will ask about your circumstances and provide information and counselling before agreeing to the procedure. You should only have a vasectomy if you are certain that you do not want to have any, or any more, children. If you have any doubts, consider another method of contraception until you are completely sure. You shouldn't make the decision about having a vasectomy after a crisis or a big change in your life \u2013 for example, if your partner has just had a baby, or has just terminated a pregnancy. If you have a partner, discuss it with them before deciding to have a vasectomy. If possible, you should both agree to the procedure, but it is not a legal requirement to get your partner's permission. You can have a vasectomy at any age. However, if you are under 30, particularly if you do not have children, your doctor may be reluctant to perform the procedure. Your GP does have the right to refuse to carry out the procedure or refuse to refer you for the procedure if they do not believe that it is in your best interests. If this is the case, you may have to pay to have a vasectomy privately. How long will I have to wait for the operation? In most parts of the UK, a vasectomy is available free of charge from the NHS. However, waiting lists can be several months, depending on where you live. Speak to your GP or ask at your local contraception clinic about vasectomies in your area. As waiting lists for vasectomies can be long, some men choose to pay to have the procedure carried out privately. You can request a male doctor, but in some cases this may mean having to wait longer. Your GP may be able to offer you options of where the vasectomy can be carried out. Recovering after the operation It\u2019s common to have some mild discomfort, swelling and bruising of your scrotum for a few days after the vasectomy. If you have pain or discomfort, you can take painkillers, such as paracetamol. Contact your GP for advice if you are still experiencing considerable pain after taking painkillers. It\u2019s common to have blood in your semen in the first few ejaculations after a vasectomy. This isn\u2019t harmful. Some other common questions about recovery are outlined below. Underwear Wearing close-fitting underwear, such as Y-fronts, during the day and at night will help to support your scrotum and will also help ease any discomfort or swelling. Make sure you change your underwear every day. Hygiene It is usually safe for you to have a bath or shower after your operation \u2013 check with your doctor what is suitable for you. Make sure you dry your genital area gently and thoroughly. Returning to work Most men will be fit to return to work one or two days after their vasectomy, but you should avoid sport and heavy lifting for at least one week after the operation. This is to minimise the risk of developing complications (see below). If any symptoms continue after a few days, consult your GP. Having sex You can have sex again as soon as it is comfortable to do so, although it is best to wait for a couple of days. However, you will still have sperm in your semen immediately after the operation, as it takes time to clear the remaining sperm in your tubes. It takes an average of 20-30 ejaculations to clear the tubes of sperm. You will need to use another method of contraception until you have had two clear semen tests. Once the operation has been carried out successfully and semen tests have shown that there is no sperm present, long-term partners may not need to use other forms of contraception. However, a vasectomy does not protect against HIV infection or any other STIs, so you should still use condoms with any new partner. How will I know if my vasectomy has worked? After the vasectomy, there will be some sperm left in the upper part of the vas deferens tubes. It can take more than 20 ejaculations to clear these sperm from the tubes so, during this time, there is still a risk of pregnancy. Until it has been confirmed that your semen is free of sperm, you should continue to use another form of contraception. At least eight weeks after the procedure, you will need to produce a sample of semen, which will be tested for sperm. This will also help to identify the rare cases in which the tubes naturally rejoin themselves. Once tests have confirmed that your semen is free of sperm, the vasectomy is considered successful and you can stop using additional contraception. A few men continue to have small numbers of sperm in their system, but these sperm do not move (they are known as non-motile sperm). If you are one of these men, your doctor will discuss your options with you. The chances of making your partner pregnant may be low enough to consider the vasectomy successful, or you may be advised to have further tests or consider other options. Is reversal possible? It is possible to have a vasectomy reversed. However, the procedure is not always successful. You have a better chance if it is done soon after the vasectomy. If a reversal is carried out within 10 years of your vasectomy, the success rate is about 55%. This falls to 25% if your reversal is carried out more than 10 years after your vasectomy. Even if a surgeon manages to join up the vas deferens tubes again, pregnancy may still not be possible. This is why you should be certain before going ahead with the vasectomy. Your doctor can help you to make your decision. Reversal is rarely available on the NHS and the operation can be expensive if done privately. Who can have a vasectomy Having a vasectomy should always be viewed as permanent sterilisation. This is because, although reversal is sometimes possible, it may not be successful. A reversal operation requires delicate microsurgery to join the tubes together again. Even with a successful operation, it still may not be possible to father a child. Advantages and disadvantages of vasectomy Advantages The failure rate is only one in 2,000 \u2013 out of 2,000 men who have a vasectomy, only one will get a woman pregnant in the rest of his lifetime. There are rarely long-term effects on your health. Vasectomy does not affect your hormone levels or sex drive. It will not affect the spontaneity of sex or interfere with sex. Vasectomy may be chosen as a simpler, safer and more reliable alternative to female sterilisation. Disadvantages Vasectomy doesn\u2019t protect against STIs It\u2019s difficult to reverse, and reversal may not be available on the NHS. You need to use contraception after the operation until tests show your semen is free of sperm \u2013 if your semen contains sperm, you could make your partner pregnant. Complications can occur \u2013 the risks are listed below. Risks Most men feel sore and tender for a few days after the operation, and will usually experience some bruising and swelling on or around their scrotum. However, in some cases, a vasectomy can cause more serious problems, some of which are outlined below. Haematoma A haematoma is when blood collects and clots in the tissue surrounding a broken blood vessel. Following a vasectomy, you may develop a haematoma inside your scrotum. Haematomas are mostly small (pea-sized), but can occasionally be large (filling the scrotum) and, rarely, they can be very large. This can cause your scrotum to become very swollen and painful. In severe cases, you may need further surgery to treat the blood clot. Sperm granulomas When the tubes that carry sperm from your testicles are cut, sperm can sometimes leak from them. In rare cases, sperm can collect in the surrounding tissue, forming hard lumps that are known as sperm granulomas. Your groin or scrotum may become painful and swollen either immediately or a few months after the procedure. The lumps are not usually painful and can often be treated using anti-inflammatory medication, which your GP will prescribe. If the granulomas are particularly large or painful, they may have to be surgically removed. Infection After a vasectomy, you may be at risk of developing an infection as a result of bacteria entering through the cuts made in your scrotum. Therefore, after the operation, it is important to keep your genital area clean and dry to keep the risk of infection as low as you can. Long-term testicle pain Some men get pain in one or both of their testicles after a vasectomy. It can happen immediately, a few months or a few years after the operation. It may be occasional or quite frequent, and vary from a constant dull ache to episodes of sharp, intense pain. For most men, however, any pain is quite mild and they do not need further help for it. Long-term testicular pain affects around one in 10 men after vasectomy. The pain is usually the result of a pinched nerve or scarring that occurred during the operation. You may be advised to undergo further surgery to repair the damage and to help minimise further pain. Testicles feeling full After a vasectomy, some men may develop the sensation that their testicles are \"fuller\" than normal. This is usually caused by the epididymis becoming filled with stored sperm. The epididymis is the long, coiled tube that rests on the back of each testicle. It helps to transport and store sperm. Any such feelings should pass naturally within a few weeks. However, speak to your GP if you are still experiencing fullness after this time. Fertility In a very small number of vasectomy cases, the vas deferens reconnects over a period of time. This means that the vasectomy will no longer be an effective form of contraception. However, it is rare for this to happen. Common questions about vasectomy Can I have the operation if I am single? Yes, but if you are under 30 you will find that many surgeons are reluctant to do it, in case your circumstances change and you regret it later. Will it affect my sex drive? No. After a successful vasectomy, your testicles will continue to produce the male hormone (testosterone) just as they did before the procedure. Your sex drive, sensation and ability to have an erection won\u2019t be affected. The only difference is that there will be no sperm in your semen. Your body still produces sperm, but they are absorbed without harm. Could being sterile affect me emotionally? It is a big decision to end the part of your life where you could father a child. This is another reason to think it over carefully. If you are sure about your decision to have a vasectomy, you may feel relieved that the worry of possible pregnancy is over and you do not need to think about contraception again. If you feel anxious or uncomfortable about the procedure, or if you think you would suffer mentally from being infertile, then it is not the best type of contraception for you. You can discuss alternatives with your GP or with a professional at a contraception clinic (sometimes called a family planning clinic). Is there any risk of vasectomy causing cancer? Although prostate cancer and testicular cancer can occur in men who have had a vasectomy, research suggests that vasectomy does not increase your risk of cancer. Can I use IVF to father a child? If you have a vasectomy, and then decide later that you want a child, there may be the option of doing so by IVF (in vitro fertilisation). To do this, a surgeon would retrieve sperm from your testicles and use this to fertilise your partner\u2019s egg. However: IVF may not be available on the NHS IVF done privately can be expensive  IVF is not always successful Can I store sperm in a sperm bank, just in case? You could but, as with IVF, sperm stored in a sperm bank cannot be relied on to bring about a pregnancy. It can also be expensive. Where to get contraception Most types of contraception are available for free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. You can get contraception, and information and advice about contraception, at: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse  community contraception clinics  some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics  sexual health clinics \u2013 they also offer contraception and STI testing services  some young people\u2019s services (call 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won't tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.  Page last reviewed: 13\/01\/2015 Next review due: 13\/01\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

They're often present at birth or develop soon afterwards. There are several different types of birthmark and some of them are very common. The two main types of birthmark are: vascular birthmarks (often red, purple or pink) caused by abnormal blood vessels in or under the skin pigmented birthmarks (usually brown) caused by clusters of pigment cells Vascular birthmarks often occur in the head and neck area, mainly on the face. But both types of birthmark can appear anywhere, including inside the body. If surface blood vessels are affected, a vascular birthmark will appear red, purple or pink. If the affected vessels are deep, the birthmark will appear blue. Pigmented birthmarks are tan or brown-coloured skin marks. Vascular birthmarks Some of the most common types of vascular birthmarks are described below. Salmon patch (stork mark) Salmon patches are flat red or pink patches that can appear on a baby's eyelids, neck or forehead at birth. They're the most common type of vascular birthmark and occur in around half of all babies. Most salmon patches will fade completely within a few months, but if they occur on the forehead they may take up to four years to disappear. Patches on the back of the neck can last longer. Salmon patches are often more noticeable when a baby cries because they fill with blood and become darker. Infantile haemangioma Infantile haemangiomas, also known as strawberry marks, are raised marks on the skin that are usually red. They can appear anywhere on the body. Sometimes infantile haemangiomas occur deeper in the skin, in which case the skin can look blue or purple. Haemangiomas are common, particularly in girls, and affect around 5% of babies soon after birth. They rapidly increase in size for the first six months before eventually shrinking and disappearing by around seven years of age. Haemangiomas that get bigger rapidly, or those that interfere with vision or feeding, may need to be treated. Capillary malformation (port wine stain) Capillary malformation, also known as port wine stains, are flat red or purple marks that affect a very small number of newborn babies. They can vary in size, from a few millimetres to several centimetres in diameter. Port wine stains often affect one side of the body and usually occur on the face, chest and back (although they can occur anywhere). They tend to be sensitive to hormones and may become more noticeable around puberty, pregnancy and the menopause. Most are permanent and may deepen in colour over time. Pigmented birthmarks Some of the most common types of pigmented birthmarks are described below. Café-au-lait spots Café-au-lait spots are coffee-coloured skin patches. Many children have one or two, but if more than six have developed by the time the child is five, you should see your GP. It could be a sign of neurofibromatosis (a number of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along the nerves). Mongolian spots Mongolian spots are blue-grey or bruised-looking birthmarks that are present from birth. They're more commonly seen in darker-skinned people and usually occur over the lower back or buttocks. However, they can also appear elsewhere on the body or limbs. Mongolian spots may last for months or years, but they usually disappear by the time a child reaches four years of age. They're completely harmless and don't need treatment. They may sometimes be mistaken for a bruise. Congenital melanocytic naevi Congenital melanocytic naevi are also known as congenital moles. They're relatively large brown or black moles that are present from birth. They're fairly common and are caused by an overgrowth of pigment cells in the skin. Most congenital melanocytic naevi become proportionally smaller and less obvious with time, although they may darken during puberty or become bumpy or hairy. They can range in size from less than 1.5cm (about 0.6 inches) to more than 20cm (about 7.9 inches) in diameter. The risk of a naevi developing into skin cancer is low, but the risk increases the larger it is. What causes birthmarks? It's not fully understood why birthmarks occur, but they're not usually inherited. Vascular birthmarks are caused by abnormal blood vessels in or under the skin, and pigmented birthmarks are caused by clusters of pigment cells. Port wine stains are thought to occur because the nerves that control the widening or narrowing of the capillaries (tiny blood vessels) don't function properly, or there aren't enough of them. This means that blood is constantly supplied to the skin in that area, which makes it permanently red or purple in colour. Port wine stains are sometimes related to other conditions, such as Sturge-Weber syndrome and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. Read more about the complications associated with birthmarks. Treating birthmarks Most birthmarks are harmless and don't need to be treated. Some types of birthmarks will fade over time, whereas other types such as port wine stains will be permanent if they're not treated. In some cases, a birthmark will need to be treated for medical reasons \u2013 for example, if a haemangioma blocks the airways, affects vision or becomes ulcerated. Some people may also decide to seek treatment for cosmetic reasons.

Always seek medical advice if you've been bitten by an animal or person and the bite has broken the skin. People and animals have a lot of bacteria in their mouths, which can cause an infection if a bite breaks the skin. These infections are rarely serious if treated quickly, but occasionally they can spread to the blood or other parts of the body. Serious infections such as tetanus and rabies are extremely rare in the UK, but it's important to get serious bites looked at as treatment to prevent these infections may be recommended. The following information is about bites by people and animals such as dogs and cats. There are separate pages on insect bites and snake bites. This page covers: What to do if you've been bitten When to get medical advice Signs that a bite may be infected Common causes of bites How to avoid animal bites What to do if you've been bitten If you've been bitten by an animal or another person: clean the wound immediately by running warm tap water over it for a couple of minutes \u2013 it's a good idea to do this even if the skin doesn't appear to be broken remove any objects from the bite, such as teeth, hair or dirt encourage the wound to bleed slightly by gently squeezing it, unless it's already bleeding freely if the wound is bleeding heavily, put a clean pad or sterile dressing over it and apply pressure dry the wound and cover it with a clean dressing or plaster take painkillers if you're in pain, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen \u2013 children under 16 years old shouldn't take aspirin seek medical advice, unless the wound is very minor If the bite has severed a body part like a finger or ear, wash it with tap water, wrap it in clean tissue, and store it in a plastic bag surrounded by ice so it can be transported to hospital. It may be possible to surgically reattach the body part later on. When to seek medical advice If the bite has broken the skin, you should seek immediate medical attention after cleaning the wound. Don't delay seeking help until symptoms of infection appear. Minor bites can be treated at your GP surgery, or by staff at your local walk-in centre or minor injuries unit. For particularly severe bites, visit your local accident and emergency (A&E) department. The healthcare professional treating you may: clean the wound and remove any damaged tissue prescribe a course of antibiotics to prevent infection recommend specific treatment to prevent infections such as tetanus if you're felt to be at risk close the wound with stitches if the risk of infection is thought to be low \u2013 high-risk wounds will usually be left open as this means they're easier to keep clean arrange blood tests to check for infection, or an X-ray to check for any damage to your bones and see if there's anything embedded in your wound, such as a tooth refer you for an assessment by a specialist if the bite penetrated a joint, or there's severe damage, such as damage to bones or nerves \u2013 surgery may be needed in these cases if you're bitten by a person with hepatitis or HIV, there's a tiny chance of the infection spreading if the bite is contaminated with blood, so you may be offered treatment to stop you becoming infected When you return home, watch out for signs of a possible infection. Signs a bite may be infected Symptoms that suggest a wound has become infected include: redness and swelling around the wound the wound feels warm and increasingly painful liquid or pus leaks from the wound a fever of 38C (100.4F) or above sweats and chills swollen glands under the chin or in the neck, armpits or groin red streaks extending along the skin from the wound Get medical help as soon as possible if you think your wound is infected. When do bites happen? Although you may be more worried about bites from wild and stray animals, any animal has the potential to bite. Many bites are actually caused by a person's own pet or an animal belonging to a friend or neighbour. Animals can act unpredictably and bites aren't always provoked. However, an animal is more likely to bite if it's been disturbed, feels threatened, or gets overexcited. Most human bites occur when one person punches another person in the mouth. They can also happen during contact sports, vigorous sex, domestic violence or sexual assault, and fits (seizures). How to avoid animal bites Most animal bites are caused by dogs. The advice below may help reduce the chances of being bitten: never leave a young child unsupervised with a dog \u2013 regardless of what type of dog it is and its previous behaviour treat dogs with respect \u2013 don't approach them suddenly, run around screaming in their presence, or interrupt them when they're eating or sleeping avoid stroking or petting unfamiliar dogs \u2013 when greeting a dog for the first time, let it sniff you before petting it It's also a good idea to avoid contact with any wild or stray animals, particularly while travelling abroad, as they can be aggressive and there's a chance they could carry serious infections, such as rabies.

Always seek medical advice if you've been bitten by an animal or person and the bite has broken the skin. People and animals have a lot of bacteria in their mouths, which can cause an infection if a bite breaks the skin. These infections are rarely serious if treated quickly, but occasionally they can spread to the blood or other parts of the body. Serious infections such as tetanus and rabies are extremely rare in the UK, but it's important to get serious bites looked at as treatment to prevent these infections may be recommended. The following information is about bites by people and animals such as dogs and cats. There are separate pages on insect bites and snake bites. This page covers: What to do if you've been bitten When to get medical advice Signs that a bite may be infected Common causes of bites How to avoid animal bites What to do if you've been bitten If you've been bitten by an animal or another person: clean the wound immediately by running warm tap water over it for a couple of minutes \u2013 it's a good idea to do this even if the skin doesn't appear to be broken remove any objects from the bite, such as teeth, hair or dirt encourage the wound to bleed slightly by gently squeezing it, unless it's already bleeding freely if the wound is bleeding heavily, put a clean pad or sterile dressing over it and apply pressure dry the wound and cover it with a clean dressing or plaster take painkillers if you're in pain, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen \u2013 children under 16 years old shouldn't take aspirin seek medical advice, unless the wound is very minor If the bite has severed a body part like a finger or ear, wash it with tap water, wrap it in clean tissue, and store it in a plastic bag surrounded by ice so it can be transported to hospital. It may be possible to surgically reattach the body part later on. When to seek medical advice If the bite has broken the skin, you should seek immediate medical attention after cleaning the wound. Don't delay seeking help until symptoms of infection appear. Minor bites can be treated at your GP surgery, or by staff at your local walk-in centre or minor injuries unit. For particularly severe bites, visit your local accident and emergency (A&E) department. The healthcare professional treating you may: clean the wound and remove any damaged tissue prescribe a course of antibiotics to prevent infection recommend specific treatment to prevent infections such as tetanus if you're felt to be at risk close the wound with stitches if the risk of infection is thought to be low \u2013 high-risk wounds will usually be left open as this means they're easier to keep clean arrange blood tests to check for infection, or an X-ray to check for any damage to your bones and see if there's anything embedded in your wound, such as a tooth refer you for an assessment by a specialist if the bite penetrated a joint, or there's severe damage, such as damage to bones or nerves \u2013 surgery may be needed in these cases if you're bitten by a person with hepatitis or HIV, there's a tiny chance of the infection spreading if the bite is contaminated with blood, so you may be offered treatment to stop you becoming infected When you return home, watch out for signs of a possible infection. Signs a bite may be infected Symptoms that suggest a wound has become infected include: redness and swelling around the wound the wound feels warm and increasingly painful liquid or pus leaks from the wound a fever of 38C (100.4F) or above sweats and chills swollen glands under the chin or in the neck, armpits or groin red streaks extending along the skin from the wound Get medical help as soon as possible if you think your wound is infected. When do bites happen? Although you may be more worried about bites from wild and stray animals, any animal has the potential to bite. Many bites are actually caused by a person's own pet or an animal belonging to a friend or neighbour. Animals can act unpredictably and bites aren't always provoked. However, an animal is more likely to bite if it's been disturbed, feels threatened, or gets overexcited. Most human bites occur when one person punches another person in the mouth. They can also happen during contact sports, vigorous sex, domestic violence or sexual assault, and fits (seizures). How to avoid animal bites Most animal bites are caused by dogs. The advice below may help reduce the chances of being bitten: never leave a young child unsupervised with a dog \u2013 regardless of what type of dog it is and its previous behaviour treat dogs with respect \u2013 don't approach them suddenly, run around screaming in their presence, or interrupt them when they're eating or sleeping avoid stroking or petting unfamiliar dogs \u2013 when greeting a dog for the first time, let it sniff you before petting it It's also a good idea to avoid contact with any wild or stray animals, particularly while travelling abroad, as they can be aggressive and there's a chance they could carry serious infections, such as rabies.

But occasionally they can become infected, cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or spread serious illnesses such as Lyme disease and malaria. Bugs that bite or sting include wasps, hornets, bees, horseflies, ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, spiders and midges. This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you've been bitten or stung When to get medical advice When to get emergency medical help Prevention Symptoms of insect bites and stings Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Some people have a mild allergic reaction and a larger area of skin around the bite or sting becomes swollen, red and painful. This should pass within a week. Occasionally, a severe allergic reaction can occur, causing symptoms such as breathing difficulties, dizziness and a swollen face or mouth. This requires immediate medical treatment (see below). Read more about the symptoms of common insect bites and stings. What to do if you've been bitten or stung To treat an insect bite or sting: Remove the sting or tick if it's still in the skin (see treating insect bites and stings for advice about how to do this safely). Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they're unlikely to help. The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. Ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments that can help, such as painkillers, creams for itching and antihistamines. Read more about treatments for insect bites and stings. When to get medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if: you're worried about a bite or sting your symptoms don't start to improve within a few days or are getting worse you've been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes a large area (around 10cm or more) around the bite becomes red and swollen you have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness you have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a fever, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms When to get emergency medical help Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe reaction, such as: wheezing or difficulty breathing a swollen face, mouth or throat nausea or vomiting a fast heart rate dizziness or feeling faint difficulty swallowing loss of consciousness Emergency treatment in hospital is needed in these cases. Prevent insect bites and stings There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin \u2013 repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants \u2013 these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. You may need to take extra precautions if you're travelling to part of the world where there's a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about how to prevent insect bites and stings.

Some snakes are venomous and can inject venom (toxin) as they bite. A bite from a venomous snake is a medical emergency as they can be deadly if not treated quickly. In the UK, adders are the only venomous snakes found in the wild. People also keep foreign (exotic) venomous snakes, sometimes illegally. Exotic snakes have been known to bite while being handled carelessly, or when they escape from their cages. There's also a risk of being bitten while travelling abroad to tropical countries. Symptoms of snake bites If an adder injects venom when it bites, it can cause serious symptoms including: pain, redness and swelling in the area of the bite nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting dizziness and fainting A foreign snake that injects venom when it bites can also cause: extensive swelling, blistering and, eventually, gangrene in the area of the bite shock muscle paralysis (an inability to move one or more muscles of the body) leading to difficulties swallowing and breathing bleeding Sometimes, venomous snakes can bite without injecting venom. This is called a \u2018dry bite' causing only: mild pain (from the snake's teeth puncturing the skin) anxiety Read more about the symptoms of snake bites. What to do after a snake bite Immediately after being bitten by a snake you should: remain calm and don't panic; snake bites, particularly those that occur in the UK, are not often serious and rarely deadly try to remember the shape, size and colour of the snake keep the part of your body that has been bitten as still as possible to prevent the venom spreading around your body remove jewellery and watches from the bitten limb because they could cut into your skin if the limb swells do not attempt to remove any clothing, such as trousers, but loosen clothing if possible Seek immediate medical assistance by dialling 999 to request an ambulance or visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. You should give healthcare professionals a description of the snake to help identify it. You may be admitted to hospital so the bite can be assessed and your condition closely monitored. Read more about what to do if bitten by a snake and how snake bites are assessed. Treating snake bites In most cases of adder bites, the only treatment required is observation in hospital. As a precaution, you may be asked to stay in hospital for 24 hours to be monitored. Antivenom medication is an effective antidote to snake venom and can be used to treat more severe snake bites. In most cases, children bitten by an adder will make a full recovery in about one to two weeks. Adults usually require more than two weeks to recover fully, and a quarter of adults will take between one and nine months. Read more about how snake bites are treated. Why do snakes bite? When a snake bites, it injects venom to immobilise its natural (food) prey. As humans are too large for a snake to eat, snakes bite only in self defence. Snake bites usually occur when a person accidentally steps on a snake while out walking. However, sometimes people are bitten when they deliberately provoke a snake by striking it or trying to pick it up.  Read more about the causes of snake bites. Preventing snake bites Follow the advice listed below if you are in an area where venomous snakes are found. look out for warning notices on heaths and commons wear boots and long trousers never pick up a snake, even if you think it's harmless or it appears dead never put your hand in a hole or crevice, for example, between rocks \u2013 if you need to retrieve something, stand well back and use a stick to reach it if you find yourself very close to a snake, stand completely still \u2013 most snakes only strike at moving targets so if you remain calm and still, the snake will escape without harming you In the UK, the adder is the only venomous snake that is found in the wild   How common are snake bites? The World Health Organization estimates that around the world there are millions of venomous snake bites each year, resulting in more than 100,000 deaths each year. However, the total number of snake bites and deaths is likely to be even higher than this. The figures vary widely depending on their source, but the majority of fatalities occur in south and south-east Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, New Guinea and Latin America \u2013 especially in rural farming areas of countries, such as India, where access to emergency medical services is limited or non-existent.  About 100 adder bites are reported in the UK each year. Most bites occur between June and August, with the number of bites peaking during in July. Less than 10 UK residents are bitten by foreign snakes each year, either while travelling abroad or by captive snakes kept in this country. Where are adders found? The adder is common throughout mainland Britain and some islands off the west coast of Scotland.

But occasionally they can become infected, cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or spread serious illnesses such as Lyme disease and malaria. Bugs that bite or sting include wasps, hornets, bees, horseflies, ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, spiders and midges. This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you've been bitten or stung When to get medical advice When to get emergency medical help Prevention Symptoms of insect bites and stings Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Some people have a mild allergic reaction and a larger area of skin around the bite or sting becomes swollen, red and painful. This should pass within a week. Occasionally, a severe allergic reaction can occur, causing symptoms such as breathing difficulties, dizziness and a swollen face or mouth. This requires immediate medical treatment (see below). Read more about the symptoms of common insect bites and stings. What to do if you've been bitten or stung To treat an insect bite or sting: Remove the sting or tick if it's still in the skin (see treating insect bites and stings for advice about how to do this safely). Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they're unlikely to help. The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. Ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments that can help, such as painkillers, creams for itching and antihistamines. Read more about treatments for insect bites and stings. When to get medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if: you're worried about a bite or sting your symptoms don't start to improve within a few days or are getting worse you've been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes a large area (around 10cm or more) around the bite becomes red and swollen you have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness you have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a fever, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms When to get emergency medical help Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe reaction, such as: wheezing or difficulty breathing a swollen face, mouth or throat nausea or vomiting a fast heart rate dizziness or feeling faint difficulty swallowing loss of consciousness Emergency treatment in hospital is needed in these cases. Prevent insect bites and stings There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin \u2013 repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants \u2013 these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. You may need to take extra precautions if you're travelling to part of the world where there's a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about how to prevent insect bites and stings.

Sometimes, a black eye can occur after cosmetic surgery to the face, such as a facelift or a nose operation. The area around the eye turns bluish or purple because tiny blood vessels under the skin burst and blood leaks out into surrounding soft tissue. Your skin may be painful and swollen and may make it difficult to fully open your eye. Your vision may also be temporarily blurred and you may have a headache. What to do if you have a black eye A black eye is not usually serious and you can usually look after it at home if there are no signs of a severe injury (see below). After a few days, the swelling around your eye will start to go down and the bruise will turn brownish-yellow before eventually fading. Like any other bruise, a black eye will usually take about a week or two to heal completely. Self-care You can normally help reduce the symptoms of a black eye. Gently apply an ice pack to the skin around your eye as soon as possible after the injury. You can use a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel. The cold will numb the pain and relieve the swelling. During the first day, you should apply the ice pack to your eye for 15-20 minutes an hour every hour. Painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, can be used to help relieve pain. Avoid using aspirin (unless your doctor advises you to take it) because it can make bleeding worse. Children under 16 should never be given aspirin. See your GP if the pain or swelling is severe or doesn't go away, or the affected area is warm, red or leaking pus (these may be signs of infection). When to go to A&E Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately if: you have hit your head and have two black eyes (this suggests a type of head injury known as a basilar skull fracture) you lost consciousness at the time of the blow to your head you have double vision or loss of vision you have other symptoms of a severe head injury, such as memory loss, a severe or persistent headache, drowsiness, seizures (fits), or vomiting you cannot move your eye you think something has pierced your eye, or there is something stuck in it your eye is cut or there is blood in your eye you have other signs of a serious eye injury, such as an irregularly shaped pupil (the black dot at the centre of the eye), pain when exposed to bright light, or flashing lights, spots, halos or shadows in your field of vision you are taking blood-thinning medication, such as aspirin, or you have a bleeding disorder, such as haemophilia Any of these situations could mean you have a serious injury and need to be assessed as soon as possible.

It causes spots, oily skin and sometimes skin that's hot or painful to touch. Acne most commonly develops on the: face \u2013 this affects almost everyone with acne back \u2013 this affects more than half of people with acne chest \u2013 this affects about 15% of people with acne Types of spots There are six main types of spot caused by acne: blackheads \u2013 small black or yellowish bumps that develop on the skin; they're not filled with dirt, but are black because the inner lining of the hair follicle produces pigmentation (colouring) whiteheads \u2013 have a similar appearance to blackheads, but may be firmer and won't empty when squeezed papules \u2013 small red bumps that may feel tender or sore pustules \u2013 similar to papules, but have a white tip in the centre, caused by a build-up of pus nodules \u2013 large hard lumps that build up beneath the surface of the skin and can be painful cysts \u2013 the most severe type of spot caused by acne; they're large pus-filled lumps that look similar to boils and carry the greatest risk of causing permanent scarring What can I do if I have acne? The self-help techniques below may be useful: Don't wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Frequent washing can irritate the skin and make symptoms worse. Wash the affected area with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse. Don't try to \"clean out\" blackheads or squeeze spots. This can make them worse and cause permanent scarring. Avoid using too much make-up and cosmetics. Use water-based products that are described as non-comedogenic (this means the product is less likely to block the pores in your skin). Completely remove make-up before going to bed. If dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free, water-based emollient. Regular exercise can't improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem. Shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising, as sweat can irritate your acne. Wash your hair regularly and try to avoid letting your hair fall across your face. Although acne can't be cured, it can be controlled with treatment. Several creams, lotions and gels for treating spots are available at pharmacies. If you develop acne, it's a good idea to speak to your pharmacist for advice. Products containing a low concentration of benzoyl peroxide may be recommended \u2013 but be careful, as this can bleach clothing. If your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back, it may need to be treated with antibiotics or stronger creams that are only available on prescription. When to seek medical advice Even mild cases of acne can cause distress. If your acne is making you feel very unhappy or you can't control your spots with over-the-counter medication, see your GP. Also see your GP if you develop nodules or cysts, as they need to be treated properly to avoid scarring. Try to resist the temptation to pick or squeeze the spots, as this can lead to permanent scarring. Treatments can take up to three months to work, so don't expect results overnight. Once they do start to work, the results are usually good. Read more about: diagnosing acne treating acne complications of acne Why do I have acne? Acne is most commonly linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age. Certain hormones cause the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum). This abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus. The hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores (opening of the hair follicles). Cleaning the skin doesn't help to remove this blockage. Other possible causes Acne is known to run in families. If both your mother and father had acne, it's likely that you'll also have acne. Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women. There's no evidence that diet, poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne. Read more about the causes of acne, including some common acne myths. Who's affected? Acne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. About 80% of people aged 11 to 30 are affected by acne. Acne is most common in girls from the ages of 14 to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16 to 19. Most people have acne on and off for several years before their symptoms start to improve as they get older. Acne often disappears when a person is in their mid-twenties. In some cases, acne can continue into adult life. About 5% of women and 1% of men have acne over the age of 25.

If you notice blood in your urine, even if it comes and goes, you should visit your GP, so the cause can be investigated. Read about the symptoms of bladder cancer. Types of bladder cancer Once diagnosed, bladder cancer can be classified by how far it has spread.  If the cancerous cells are contained inside the lining of the bladder, doctors describe it as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This is the most common type of bladder cancer, accounting for 7 out of 10 cases. Most people don't die as a result of this type of bladder cancer. When the cancerous cells spread beyond the lining, into the surrounding muscles of the bladder, it's referred to as muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This is less common, but has a higher chance of spreading to other parts of the body and can be fatal. If bladder cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it's known as locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer. Read more about diagnosing bladder cancer. Why does bladder cancer happen? Most cases of bladder cancer appear to be caused by exposure to harmful substances, which lead to abnormal changes in the bladder's cells over many years.  Tobacco smoke is a common cause and it's estimated that half of all cases of bladder cancer are caused by smoking. Contact with certain chemicals previously used in manufacturing is also known to cause bladder cancer. However, these substances have since been banned. Read more about the causes of bladder cancer and preventing bladder cancer. Treating bladder cancer In cases of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, it's usually possible to remove the cancerous cells while leaving the rest of the bladder intact. This is done using a surgical technique called transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT). This is followed by a dose of chemotherapy medication directly into the bladder, to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. In cases with a higher risk of recurrence, a medication known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) may be injected into the bladder to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. Treatment for high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, or muscle-invasive bladder cancer may involve surgically removing the bladder in an operation known as a cystectomy. When the bladder is removed, you'll need another way of collecting your urine. Possible options include making an opening in the abdomen so urine can be passed into an external bag, or constructing a new bladder out of a section of bowel. This will be done at the same time as a cystectomy. If it's possible to avoid removing the bladder, or if surgery is not suitable, a course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be recommended. Chemotherapy may sometimes be used on its own before surgery or before being combined with radiotherapy. After treatment for all types of bladder cancer, you'll have regular follow-up tests to check for signs of recurrence. Read more about treating bladder cancer. Who is affected? About 10,000 people are diagnosed with bladder cancer every year and it's the seventh most common cancer in the UK. The condition is more common in older adults, with more than half of all new cases diagnosed in people aged 75 and above. Bladder cancer is also more common in men than in women, possibly because in the past, men were more likely to smoke and work in the manufacturing industry.

It's a common type of urinary tract infection (UTI), particularly in women, and is usually more of a nuisance than a cause for serious concern. Mild cases will often get better by themselves within a few days. However, some people experience episodes of cystitis frequently and may need regular or long-term treatment. There's also a chance that cystitis could lead to a more serious kidney infection in some cases, so it's important to seek medical advice if your symptoms don't improve. Signs and symptoms of cystitis The main symptoms of cystitis include: pain, burning or stinging when you pee needing to pee more often and urgently than normal urine that's dark, cloudy or strong smelling pain low down in your tummy feeling generally unwell, achy, sick and tired Possible symptoms in young children include a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above, weakness, irritability, reduced appetite and vomiting. Read more about the symptoms of cystitis. When to see your GP Women don't necessarily need to see their GP if they have cystitis, as mild cases often get better without treatment. You can try the self-help measures listed below, or ask your pharmacist for advice. See your GP if: you're not sure whether you have cystitis your symptoms don't start to improve within a few days you get cystitis frequently you have severe symptoms, such as blood in your urine, a fever or pain in your side you're pregnant and have symptoms of cystitis you're a man and have symptoms of cystitis your child has symptoms of cystitis Your GP should be able to diagnose cystitis by asking about your symptoms. They may test a sample of your urine for bacteria to help confirm the diagnosis. What causes cystitis? Most cases are thought to occur when bacteria that live harmlessly in the bowel or on the skin get into the bladder through the urethra (tube that carries urine out of your body). It's not always clear how this happens, but it can be caused by: having sex wiping your bottom after going to the toilet \u2013 particularly if you wipe from back to front inserting a tampon or urinary catheter (a thin tube inserted into the urethra to drain the bladder) using a diaphragm for contraception Women may get cystitis more often than men because their anus (back passage) is closer to their urethra, and their urethra is much shorter, which means bacteria may be able to get into the bladder more easily. Read more about the causes of cystitis. Treatments for cystitis If you see your GP with cystitis, you'll usually be prescribed antibiotics to treat the infection. These should start to have an effect within a day or two. If you've had cystitis before and don't feel you need to see your GP, you may want to treat your symptoms at home. Until you're feeling better, it may help to: take paracetamol or ibuprofen drink plenty of water hold a hot water bottle on your tummy or between your thighs avoid having sex Some people find it helpful to try over-the-counter products that reduce the acidity of their urine (such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate), but there's a lack of evidence to suggest they're effective. If you keep getting cystitis, your GP may give you an antibiotic prescription to take to a pharmacy whenever you develop symptoms, without needing to see your doctor first. Your GP can also prescribe a low dose of antibiotics for you to take continuously over several months. Read more about treating cystitis. Preventing cystitis If you get cystitis frequently, there are some things you can try that may stop it coming back. However, it's not clear how effective most of these measures are. These measures include: not using perfumed bubble bath, soap or talcum powder around your genitals \u2013 use plain, unperfumed varieties having a shower, rather than a bath \u2013 this avoids exposing your genitals to the chemicals in your cleaning products for too long going to the toilet as soon as you need to pee and always emptying your bladder fully staying well hydrated \u2013 drinking plenty of fluids may help to stop bacteria multiplying in your bladder  always wiping your bottom from front to back when you go to the toilet emptying your bladder as soon as possible after having sex not using a diaphragm for contraception \u2013 you may wish to use another method of contraception instead wearing underwear made from cotton, rather than synthetic material such as nylon, and not wearing tight jeans and trousers Drinking cranberry juice has traditionally been recommended as a way of reducing your chances of getting cystitis. However, large studies have suggested it doesn't make a significant difference. Interstitial cystitis If you have long-term or frequent pelvic pain and problems peeing, you may have a condition called interstitial cystitis. This is a poorly understood bladder condition that mostly affects middle-aged women. Unlike regular cystitis, there's no obvious infection in the bladder and antibiotics don't help. However, your doctor may be able to recommend a number of other treatments to reduce your symptoms. Read more about interstitial cystitis.

They may not cause any symptoms if they're small enough to be passed out of the bladder when you pee. However, most people with bladder stones do experience symptoms because the stones either irritate the wall of the bladder or block the flow of urine. Typical symptoms of bladder stones include: lower abdominal pain, which can often be severe (men may also have pain in or around their penis) pain or difficulty when peeing peeing more frequently (particularly at night) cloudy or dark-coloured urine blood in the urine  Most cases of bladder stones affect men aged 50 or older, because of the link with prostate enlargement (see below). It's rare for bladder stones to affect children. In children, they can lead to bedwetting, and some boys may experience priapism \u2013 a persistent and often painful erection that can last for hours. When to see your GP See your GP if you experience any of the above symptoms, particularly if you have persistent abdominal pain, need to pee more frequently, or have blood in your urine. These symptoms may not necessarily be caused by bladder stones, but need to be investigated further. If your GP suspects you have a stone in your bladder, you'll be referred to hospital for testing. A blood and a urine test will probably be carried out first. A blood test will detect if there's an infection inside your bladder. The next stage is to take an X-ray of your bladder. Not all types of bladder stones show up clearly on X-rays, so a negative X-ray result doesn't always mean that you don't have bladder stones. An ultrasound scan may be used instead of an X-ray. Bladder stones can also be identified using a cystoscopy. A thin, fibre optic tube with a light and a camera at one end (a cystoscope) is inserted into the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body) and moved up into the bladder. The camera relays images to a screen, where they can be seen by the urologist (specialist in treating bladder conditions). What causes bladder stones? Each year in England an estimated 6,000 people are admitted to hospital to be treated for bladder stones. Bladder stones usually form when you can't completely empty your bladder of urine. A common reason for this in men is having an enlarged prostate gland that blocks the flow of urine. If urine sits in the bladder for a long time, chemicals in the urine form crystals, which harden into bladder stones. Read more about the causes of bladder stones, and who's at risk.  Treating bladder stones Surgery is usually needed to remove the stones from the bladder. The most common procedure is a cystolitholapaxy, where a thin tube (cystoscope) with a camera at the end is used to find the bladder stones. The cystoscope will then use 'stone-crushing' devices, lasers or ultrasound to break up the stones before they're removed. Where possible, it's important to treat the underlying causes of bladder stones to prevent new stones developing in the future. Read more about treating bladder stones. Preventing bladder stones In people with urinary tract infections (UTIs), the measures below are recommended to try to prevent bladder stones forming. You should: increase your daily fluid intake to 2-3 litres to lower the concentration of your urine regularly empty your bladder without delaying urinate again 10-20 seconds after your first attempt (if you're unable to empty your bladder completely first time); this is called \"double voiding\" and it helps empty the bladder more efficiently avoid constipation (regular laxatives may be recommended) The bladder and kidneys The kidneys filter waste products out of the blood, which are mixed with water to create urine. Urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder, where it is stored. When the bladder is full and you're ready to pee, urine passes out of your body through a tube called the urethra.

Many deaths could be prevented if first aid is given before emergency services arrive. What to do If someone is injured you should: first check that you and the casualty aren't in any danger, and, if possible, make the situation safe if necessary, dial 999 or 112 for an ambulance when it's safe to do so carry out basic first aid Read more about what to do after an incident. If someone is unconscious and breathing If a person is unconscious but breathing, and has no other injuries that would stop them being moved, place them in the recovery position until help arrives. Keep them under observation to ensure they continue to breathe normally, and don't obstruct their airway. If someone is unconscious and not breathing If a person isn't breathing normally after an incident, call an ambulance and start CPR straight away. Use hands-only CPR if you aren't trained to perform rescue breaths. Read more about CPR, including instructions and a video about hands-only CPR. Common accidents and emergencies Below, in alphabetical order, are some of the most common injuries that need emergency treatment in the UK and information about how to deal with them: anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) bleeding burns and scalds   choking  drowning  electric shock (domestic)  fractures  heart attack  poisoning  shock  stroke Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) is a severe allergic reaction that can occur after an insect sting or after eating certain foods. The adverse reaction can be very fast, occurring within seconds or minutes of coming into contact with the substance the person is allergic to (allergen). During anaphylactic shock, it may be difficult for the person to breathe, as their tongue and throat may swell, obstructing their airway. Call 999 or 112 immediately if you think someone is experiencing anaphylactic shock. Check if the person is carrying any medication. Some people who know they have severe allergies may carry an adrenaline self-injector, which is a type of pre-loaded syringe. You can either help the person administer their medication or, if you're trained to do so, give it to them yourself. After the injection, continue to look after the person until medical help arrives. All casualties who have had an intramuscular or subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of adrenaline must be seen and medically checked by a healthcare professional as soon as possible after the injection has been given. Make sure they're comfortable and can breathe as best they can while waiting for medical help to arrive. If they're conscious, sitting upright is normally the best position for them. Read more about treating anaphylaxis. Bleeding If someone is bleeding heavily, the main aim is to prevent further blood loss and minimise the effects of shock (see below). First, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance as soon as possible. If you have disposable gloves, use them to reduce the risk of any infection being passed on. Check that there's nothing embedded in the wound. If there is, take care not to press down on the object. Instead, press firmly on either side of the object and build up padding around it before bandaging, to avoid putting pressure on the object itself. If nothing is embedded: apply and maintain pressure to the wound with your gloved hand, using a clean pad or dressing if possible; continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops  use a clean dressing to bandage the wound firmly if bleeding continues through the pad, apply pressure to the wound  until the bleeding stops and then apply another pad over the top and bandage it in place; don't remove the original pad or dressing, but continue to check that the bleeding has stopped  If a body part, such as a finger, has been severed, place it in a plastic bag or wrap it in cling film and make sure it goes with the casualty to hospital. Always seek medical help for bleeding unless it's minor. If someone has a nosebleed that hasn't stopped after 20 minutes, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Read more about how to treat minor bleeding from cuts and grazes and how to treat nosebleeds. Haemostatic dressings and tourniquets In certain situations, where bleeding is very severe and from the body\u2019s extremities, such as the head, neck and torso, it may be appropriate to use haemostatic dressings or a tourniquet. Haemostatic dressings contain properties that help the blood to clot (thicken) quicker. A tourniquet is a band that's wrapped tightly around a limb to stop blood loss. Haemostatic dressings and tourniquets should only be used by people who have been trained to apply them. Burns and scalds If someone has a burn or scald: cool the burn as quickly as possible with cool running water for at least 10 minutes, or until the pain is relieved call 999 or seek medical help, if needed while cooling the burn, carefully remove any clothing or jewellery, unless it's attached to the skin if you're cooling a large burnt area, particularly in babies, children and elderly people, be aware that it may cause hypothermia (it may be necessary to stop cooling the burn to avoid hypothermia)  cover the burn loosely with cling film; if cling film isn't available, use a clean, dry dressing or non-fluffy material; don't wrap the burn tightly, because swelling may lead to further injury don't apply creams, lotions or sprays to the burn For chemical burns, wear protective gloves, remove any affected clothing, and rinse the burn with cool running water for at least 20 minutes to wash out the chemical. If possible, determine the cause of the injury. In certain situations where a chemical is regularly handled, a specific chemical antidote may be available to use. Be careful not to contaminate and injure yourself with the chemical, and wear protective clothing if necessary. Call 999 or 112 for immediate medical help. Read more about how to treat burns and scalds. Choking The information below is for choking in adults and children over one year old. Read what to do if a baby under one year old is choking. Mild choking If the airway is only partly blocked, the person will usually be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe. In situations like this, a person will usually be able to clear the blockage themselves. If choking is mild: encourage the person to cough to try to clear the blockage ask them to try to spit out the object if it\u2019s in their mouth don't put your fingers in their mouth to help them because they may accidentally bite you If coughing doesn\u2019t work, start back blows (see below). Severe choking  If choking is severe, the person won\u2019t be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe, and without help they\u2019ll eventually become unconscious. To help an adult or child over one year old: Stand behind the person and slightly to one side. Support their chest with one hand. Lean the person forward so that the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down. Give up to five sharp blows between the person\u2019s shoulder blades with the heel of your hand (the heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist). Check if the blockage has cleared. If not, give up to five abdominal thrusts (see below). Abdominal thrusts shouldn't be used on babies under one year old, pregnant women or obese people. To perform abdominal thrusts on a person who is severely choking and isn\u2019t in one of the above groups: Stand behind the person who is choking. Place your arms around their waist and bend them well forward. Clench one fist and place it just above the person's belly button. Place your other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards. Repeat this up to five times. The aim is to get the obstruction out with each chest thrust, rather than necessarily doing all five. If the obstruction doesn't clear after three cycles of back blows and chest thrusts, dial 999 or 112 to ask for an ambulance, and continue until help arrives. The person choking should always be seen by a healthcare professional afterwards to check for any injuries or small pieces of the obstruction that remain. Drowning If someone is in difficulty in water, don't enter the water to help unless it's absolutely essential. Once the person is on land, if they're not breathing, open the airway and give five initial rescue breaths before starting CPR. If you're alone, perform CPR for one minute before calling for emergency help. Find out how to give CPR, including rescue breaths. If the person is unconscious but still breathing, put them into the recovery position with their head lower than their body and call an ambulance immediately. Continue to observe the casualty to ensure they don't stop breathing or that their airway becomes obstructed. Electric shock (domestic) If someone has had an electric shock, switch off the electrical current at the mains to break the contact between the person and the electrical supply. If you can't reach the mains supply: don't go near or touch the person until you're sure the electrical supply has been switched off   once the power supply has been switched off, and if the person isn't breathing, dial 999 or 112 to for an ambulance Afterwards, seek medical help - unless the electric shock is very minor. Fractures It can be difficult to tell if a person has a broken bone or a joint, as opposed to a simple muscular injury. If you're in any doubt, treat the injury as a broken bone. If the person is unconscious, has difficulty breathing or is bleeding severely, these must be dealt with first, by controlling the bleeding with direct pressure and performing CPR. If the person is conscious, prevent any further pain or damage by keeping the fracture as still as possible until you get them safely to hospital. Assess the injury and decide whether the best way to get them to hospital is by ambulance or car. For example, if the pain isn\u2019t too severe, you could transport them to hospital by car. It's always best to get someone else to drive, so that you can deal with the casualty if they deteriorate \u2013 for example, if they lose consciousness as a result of the pain or start to vomit. However, if: they\u2019re in a lot of pain and in need of strong painkilling medication, don't move them and call an ambulance it's obvious they have a broken leg, don't move them, but keep them in the position you found them in and call an ambulance you suspect they have injured or broken their back, don't move them and call an ambulance Don't give the casualty anything to eat or drink, because they may need an anaesthetic (numbing medication) when they reach hospital. You can read more about specific broken bones in the following pages:  broken ankle broken arm or wrist broken collarbone broken nose broken toe fractured ribs hip fracture Heart attack A heart attack is one of the most common life-threatening heart conditions in the UK. If you think a person is having, or has had, a heart attack, sit them down and make them as comfortable as possible, and call 999 or 112 for an ambulance. Symptoms of a heart attack include: chest pain \u2013 the pain is usually located in the centre or left side of the chest and can feel like a sensation of pressure, tightness or squeezing pain in other parts of the body \u2013 it can feel as if the pain is travelling from the chest down one or both arms, or into the jaw, neck, back or abdomen (tummy)  Sit the person down and make them comfortable. If they're conscious, reassure them and ask them to take a 300mg aspirin tablet to chew slowly (unless you know they shouldn't take aspirin \u2013 for example, if they're under 16 or allergic to it). If the person has any medication for angina, such as a spray or tablets, help them to take it. Monitor their vital signs, such as breathing, until help arrives. If the person deteriorates and becomes unconscious, open their airway, check their breathing and, if necessary, start CPR. Re-alert the emergency services that the casualty is now in cardiac arrest. Poisoning Poisoning is potentially life-threatening. Most cases of poisoning in the UK happen when a person has swallowed a toxic substance, such as bleach, taken an overdose of a prescription medication, or eaten wild plants and fungi. Alcohol poisoning can cause similar symptoms. If you think someone has swallowed a poisonous substance, call 999 or 112 to get immediate medical help and advice. The effects of poisoning depend on the substance swallowed, but can include vomiting, loss of consciousness, pain or a burning sensation. The following advice is important: Find out what's been swallowed, so you can tell the paramedic or doctor. Do not give the person anything to eat or drink unless a healthcare professional advises you to. Do not try to cause vomiting. Stay with the person, because their condition may get worse and they could become unconscious. If the person becomes unconscious while you're waiting for help to arrive, check for breathing and, if necessary, perform CPR. Don't perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if the casualty's mouth or airway is contaminated with the poison. Don't leave them if they're unconscious because they may roll onto their back, which could cause them to vomit. The vomit could then enter their lungs and make them choke. If the casualty is conscious and breathing normally, put them into the recovery position and continue to monitor their conscious state and breathing. Read more about treating someone who's been poisoned and treating alcohol poisoning. Shock In the case of a serious injury or illness, it's important to look out for signs of shock (see below). Shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the circulatory system fails to provide enough oxygenated blood to the body and, as a result, deprives the vital organs of oxygen. This is usually due to severe blood loss, but it can also occur after severe burns, severe vomiting, a heart attack, bacterial infection or a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). The type of shock described here isn't the same as the emotional response of feeling shocked, which can also occur after an accident. Signs of shock include: pale, cold, clammy skin sweating rapid, shallow breathing weakness and dizziness feeling sick and possibly vomiting thirst yawning sighing Seek medical help immediately if you notice that someone has any of the above signs of shock. If they do, you should: dial 999 or 112 as soon as possible and ask for an ambulance treat any obvious injuries lie the person down if their injuries allow you to and, if possible, raise and support their legs use a coat or blanket to keep them warm don't give them anything to eat or drink give them lots of comfort and reassurance monitor the person \u2013 if they stop breathing, start CPR and re-alert the emergency services Stroke The FAST guide is the most important thing to remember when dealing with people who have had a stroke. The earlier they receive treatment, the better. Call for emergency medical help straight away. If you think a person has had a stroke, use the FAST guide: Facial weakness \u2013 is the person unable to smile evenly, or are their eyes or mouth droopy? Arm weakness \u2013 is the person only able to raise one arm? Speech problems \u2013 is the person unable to speak clearly or understand you? Time to call 999 or 112 \u2013 for emergency help if a person has any of these symptoms Read more about the symptoms of a stroke. Getting help in an emergency In the UK, 999 has been the emergency services number for many years. However, you can now also call 112 to get help, which is the single emergency telephone number for the EU. This number will give you access to the emergency services wherever you are in the EU. When you call 999 or 112, you'll be asked what service you need, as well as: your telephone number the address you're calling from  a brief description of what's wrong with the casualty and whether they're bleeding, unconscious or not breathing The call handler may advise you on how to assist the casualty until help arrives.

What causes a woman to bleed after sex? There are many reasons why a woman may bleed after sex. The medical name for this is \"postcoital bleeding\". If you're concerned because you experience vaginal bleeding after sex, seek advice from your GP or a sexual health clinic (genitourinary or GUM clinic). They will ask about your medical history and assess your symptoms. They can then advise you if any treatment is needed. Causes of bleeding after sex Bleeding after sex can be a sign of a health condition: an infection, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), or a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as chlamydia vaginal dryness (atrophic vaginitis) caused by reduced vaginal secretions after the menopause damage to the vagina, such as tears caused by childbirth, or by dryness or friction during sex cervical or endometrial polyps (benign or non-cancerous growths in the womb or the lining of the cervix) cervical ectropion (also known as cervical erosion), where there is an inflamed area on the surface of the cervix In rare instances, bleeding after sex can be a sign of cervical or vaginal cancer. Tests and examinations Depending on any other symptoms and your medical history, your GP may recommend some tests or examinations, such as: a pregnancy test (depending on your age) a pelvic examination (where the GP inserts two fingers into your vagina to feel for anything unusual) looking at the cervix with an instrument called a speculum If the problem is caused by vaginal dryness, they may recommend that you try using lubricating gels. You may also be referred to a specialist, such as a gynaecologist or genitourinary specialist. Cervical screening tests It's important that all women aged 25 to 64 get regular cervical screening tests to help prevent cervical cancer. Read more information about cervical screening tests.

In general, bright-red blood means the bleeding has come from somewhere near your anus and is a typical sign of piles (haemorrhoids) or a small tear (anal fissure) in the skin of your anus. Although these are common problems, don't let embarrassment stop you seeing your GP. You should always get rectal bleeding checked to rule out more serious causes. Around 10% of adults experience rectal bleeding every year in the UK. If the blood is darker in colour and sticky, the bleeding may have occurred higher up your digestive system. This type of bleeding can turn your faeces black or plum-coloured (known as melaena). Having plum-coloured, dark and sticky faeces may be a medical emergency \u2013 you should see your GP immediately or contact NHS 111. How your GP investigates rectal bleeding If your GP needs to examine you to find out what's causing your rectal bleeding, they may carry out a rectal examination. This involves putting a gloved finger inside your bottom (rectum). There's no need to feel embarrassed or nervous: it's a quick and painless procedure that GPs are used to doing. The examination usually takes one to five minutes, depending on whether your GP finds anything unusual. You may be referred to a hospital or specialist clinic if further examinations and tests are needed. Is it bowel cancer? Many people with rectal bleeding worry they may have bowel cancer. While rectal bleeding can be a sign of early-stage bowel cancer, other factors may also be present for your doctor to think you're at risk. You should be urgently referred to a specialist with suspected bowel cancer if you have rectal bleeding and: you're aged 40 or older and have passed looser or more frequent stools for the last six weeks you're aged 60 or older and the bleeding has lasted for six weeks or more your GP has found an abnormality (such as a lump) after examining you  you also have anaemia (a reduced number of red blood cells) you have a family history of bowel cancer you have ulcerative colitis Bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer, depending on where the cancer starts. Find out more about bowel cancer, and read the NICE guidelines for being referred with suspected cancer. Common causes of rectal bleeding Some of the most common causes of visible rectal bleeding in adults are outlined below. However, don't try to diagnose yourself, and always see your GP for a proper diagnosis. Click on the links for more information about these causes. piles (haemorrhoids) \u2013 swollen blood vessels in and around the rectum. They can bleed when you have a bowel movement, which can leave streaks of bright-red blood in your stools and on the toilet paper. Piles may also cause itchiness around your anus. They often heal on their own. anal fissure \u2013 a small tear in the skin of the anus, which can be painful as the skin is very sensitive. The blood is usually bright red and the bleeding soon stops. You may feel like you need to keep passing stools, even when your bowel is empty. It often heals on its own within a few weeks. anal fistula \u2013 a small channel that develops between the end of the bowel, known as the anal canal or back passage, and the skin near the anus (the opening where waste leaves the body). They're usually painful and can cause bleeding when you go to the toilet. angiodysplasia \u2013 abnormal blood vessels in the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause bleeding. It's more common in older people and can cause painless rectal bleeding. gastroenteritis \u2013 a viral or bacterial infection of the stomach and bowel, which your immune system usually fights off after a few days. It can cause diarrhoea containing traces of blood and mucus, as well as vomiting and stomach cramps. diverticula \u2013 small bulges in the lining of your lower bowel. These contain weakened blood vessels that can burst and cause sudden, painless bleeding (you may pass quite a lot of blood in your stools). bowel cancer (colon or rectal cancer) \u2013 you should always get checked by your GP if you have rectal bleeding. The only symptom of bowel cancer may be rectal bleeding in the early stages, so don't ignore it. Bowel cancer can be treated more easily if it's diagnosed at an early stage. Less common causes of rectal bleeding Some of the more unusual causes of rectal bleeding include: anticoagulant drugs \u2013 such as warfarin or aspirin, which are taken to reduce your chance of a blood clot but can sometimes cause internal bleeding. inflammatory bowel disease \u2013 such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. These long-term conditions cause the lining of the bowel to become inflamed. Crohn's disease affects the gut higher up, whereas ulcerative colitis affects the large bowel and rectum further down. Both tend to cause bloody diarrhoea. bowel polyps \u2013 small growths on the inner lining of the colon or rectum. These are common and often don't cause symptoms, but may lead to a small amount of blood in your stool. sexually transmitted infections (STIs) \u2013 any sexual activity involving the anal area can spread STIs, which may sometimes lead to rectal bleeding. Read more about the risks of anal sex.

It's a very serious condition and can be fatal. Subarachnoid haemorrhages account for around 1 in every 20 strokes in the UK. Symptoms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage There are usually no warning signs but a subarachnoid haemorrhage sometimes happens during physical effort or straining \u2013 such as coughing, going to the toilet, lifting something heavy or having sex. The main symptoms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage include: a sudden agonising headache \u2013 which is often described as being similar to a sudden hit on the head, resulting in a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before a stiff neck feeling and being sick sensitivity to light (photophobia) blurred or double vision stroke-like symptoms \u2013 such as slurred speech and weakness on one side of the body loss of consciousness or convulsions (uncontrollable shaking) A subarachnoid haemorrhage is a medical emergency. Dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you, or someone in your care, has these symptoms. How a subarachnoid haemorrhage is treated A person with a suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage needs a computerised tomography (CT) scan in hospital to check for signs of bleeding around the brain. If a diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage is confirmed or strongly suspected, you're likely to be transferred to a specialist neurosciences unit. Medication will usually be given to help prevent short-term complications (see below) and a procedure to repair the source of the bleeding may be carried out. Read more about:  diagnosing a subarachnoid haemorrhage treating a subarachnoid haemorrhage What causes subarachnoid haemorrhages? The majority of subarachnoid haemorrhages are caused by a brain aneurysm bursting. A brain aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel, caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall. It's not known exactly why brain aneurysms develop in some people. However, certain risk factors have been identified, including: smoking high blood pressure excessive alcohol consumption Less common causes of subarachnoid haemorrhages include having abnormally developed blood vessels and inflammation of blood vessels in the brain. Severe head injuries often cause subarachnoid bleeding, but this is a separate problem known as a \"traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage\". Read more about the causes of subarachnoid haemorrhages. Who's affected? Between April 2013 and April 2014, more than 6,000 people were admitted to hospitals in England with a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Subarachnoid haemorrhages can happen at any age but they're most common in people aged between 45 and 70. Slightly more women are affected than men. Subarachnoid haemorrhages are also more common in black people compared to other ethnic groups. This could be because black people are more likely to have high blood pressure. Read more about black health issues. Reducing your risk It's not always possible to prevent a subarachnoid haemorrhage, but there are some things you can do to reduce your risk. The three most effective steps you can take to reduce your chances of having a subarachnoid haemorrhage are: stop smoking \u2013 your GP can refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking Service for help and advice or you can call the NHS Smoking Helpline on 0300 123 1044 moderate your alcohol consumption take steps to prevent high blood pressure \u2013 such as regular exercise, eating a healthy diet and losing weight if you're overweight Possible complications A subarachnoid haemorrhage can cause both short and long-term complications. Serious short-term complications can include further bleeding at the site of any aneurysm and brain damage caused by a reduction in blood supply to the brain. Long-term complications include: epilepsy \u2013 where a person has repeated seizures (fits) problems with certain mental functions, such as memory, planning and concentration changes in mood, such as depression Read more about the complications of a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Outlook Although the outlook for subarachnoid haemorrhage has improved in the last few decades, around half of all cases are fatal, and people who survive can be left with long-term problems. Recovering after a subarachnoid haemorrhage can also be a slow and frustrating process, and it's common to have problems such as: extreme tiredness headaches problems sleeping Read more about recovering from a subarachnoid haemorrhage.

Although it's a common problem, it's not normal to bleed at this time \u2013 even if it's just spotting \u2013 so don't ignore it. Make an appointment to see your GP as soon as possible. The cause is usually something minor, such as inflammation of the womb lining, but cancer is always a possibility that must be ruled out. Most likely causes There can be several reasons for bleeding after the menopause. The most common causes are: inflammation and thinning of the vaginal lining (atrophic vaginitis) or womb lining (endometrial atrophy) \u2013 caused by lower oestrogen levels cervical or womb polyps \u2013 growths, which are usually non-cancerous, that can form in the cervix (neck of the womb) or the womb itself a thickened womb lining (endometrial hyperplasia) \u2013 which can be caused by hormone replacement therapy (HRT), high levels of oestrogen or by being overweight; if left untreated this can lead to development of womb cancer (also known as endometrial cancer) About 1 in every 10 women with postmenopausal bleeding will have womb cancer, and in a few cases bleeding may be a sign of another type of cancer such as vulval, vaginal or cervical cancer. Diagnosing the cause Your GP should refer you to hospital for further tests. This will help to identify the cause of your problem, to exclude cancer and plan necessary treatment. Some areas have specialist postmenopausal bleeding clinics.  The tests that may be carried out can include: a vaginal ultrasound scan a pelvic examination tests on a sample of your womb lining (endometrial biopsy) a camera test called a hysteroscopy These procedures are described below. Some GPs are able to carry out the ultrasound and examination themselves, and will refer you for the hysteroscopy if this is necessary. At the clinic The specialist at the clinic, which may be a nurse, will take your medical history and record your symptoms. You'll then go to the scan room for an examination. Vaginal ultrasound scan A vaginal ultrasound scan is performed by gently inserting a fine ultrasound probe into your vagina, which you may find slightly uncomfortable. It usually takes about 10 minutes. The probe emits high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your vagina and womb, which is then displayed on a monitor. The results of this examination will then be discussed with you, and you'll find out whether you need a biopsy or hysteroscopy. This is mainly determined by the thickness of the womb lining. Pelvic examination The specialist will also carry out a pelvic examination. They will insert a speculum into your vagina, similar to having a cervical screening test, so your vulva, vagina and cervix can be carefully examined. Most women find this a bit uncomfortable. Swabs may be taken from your vagina and\/or cervix to rule out any infection. The doctor may wish to carry out a cervical screening test as well if this is overdue. If the lining of the womb is thickened, a small sample of tissue (biopsy) may be removed using a fine, flexible plastic tube. This can cause cramps and bleeding, which usually settles very quickly. The test can be stopped if you are finding it too uncomfortable, so let the healthcare professional carrying out the test know if you want them to stop. The speculum is then removed and an internal examination is performed. This allows the doctor to gauge the size, shape and consistency of your womb, and also assess if there is any tenderness in your pelvis. Hysteroscopy A hysteroscopy allows the doctor to look inside your womb and remove a small sample of tissue for testing using a fine telescope-like instrument called a hysteroscope. The hysteroscope is passed through your cervix under either local anaesthetic (where the area is numbed so you don't feel any pain) or general anaesthetic (where you are asleep). Read more about having a hysteroscopy. Treating postmenopausal bleeding Treatment depends on what is causing your bleeding. For example, if the cause is cervical polyps, you may need to have them removed. This fairly simple procedure can be done in the specialist's office. Small forceps are used to grasp and gently twist the polyp, which usually comes off easily, and any bleeding is stopped using cautery (heat) or by applying chemicals. Endometrial atrophy can be treated with oestrogen cream or pessaries, although treatment may not be necessary if your symptoms are minimal. There are various types of endometrial hyperplasia which may be treated with hormone medication (tablets or an intrauterine system implant) or surgery to remove your uterus, cervix and ovaries (a total hysterectomy). Occasionally, if the changes are mild, no treatment may be necessary. If your bleeding is thought to be a side effect of HRT, altering or stopping the treatment may be recommended. If you have womb cancer, a total hysterectomy will often be recommended.  Read more about treating womb cancer.

Blepharitis can develop at any age, and symptoms can include: itchy, sore and red eyelids that stick together crusty or greasy eyelashes a burning, gritty sensation in your eyes increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) swollen eyelid margins finding contact lenses uncomfortable to wear abnormal eyelash growth or loss of eyelashes in severe cases In most cases both eyes are affected, but one eye can be more affected than the other. The symptoms tend to be worse in the morning. When to get medical advice See your high-street optician (optometrist) if you have persistent symptoms of blepharitis that aren't being controlled by simple eyelid hygiene measures. They can examine you to check if the problem is caused by an underlying condition, or may refer you to an eye specialist. Contact your optometrist or GP immediately if you have any severe symptoms. If this isn't possible, visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. How blepharitis is treated Blepharitis is usually a long-term condition. Most people experience repeated episodes, separated by periods without symptoms. It can't usually be cured, but a daily eyelid-cleaning routine can help control the symptoms and prevent permanent scarring of the eyelid margins. There are three main steps to eyelid hygiene that should be performed once or twice a day: using a warm compress \u2013 to make the oil produced by the glands around your eyes more runny gently massaging your eyelids \u2013 to push the oils out of the glands cleaning your eyelids \u2013 to wipe away any excess oil and remove any crusts, bacteria, dust or grime that might have built up More severe cases may require antibiotics that are either applied to the eye or eyelid directly, or taken as tablets. Read more about treating blepharitis. What causes blepharitis? There are three main types of blepharitis: anterior blepharitis \u2013 where the inflammation affects the skin around the base of your eyelashes posterior blepharitis \u2013 where the inflammation affects your Meibomian glands, found along the eyelid margins behind the base of the eyelashes mixed blepharitis \u2013 a combination of both anterior and posterior blepharitis Anterior blepharitis can be caused by either: a reaction to Staphylococcus bacteria \u2013 these usually live harmlessly on the skin of many people, but for unknown reasons they can cause the eyelids to become inflamed seborrhoeic dermatitis \u2013 a skin condition that causes skin to become oily or flaky and sometimes irritate the eyelids, causing the Meibomian glands to block Posterior blepharitis is caused by a problem with the Meibomian glands, where the glands get blocked by either debris, skin flakes or inflammation. Sometimes blockages in the Meibomian glands are associated with a skin condition called rosacea. If too much oily substance is being produced, this may be caused by seborrhoeic dermatitis. Mixed blepharitis, which is the most common, is caused by a combination of both anterior and posterior blepharitis. Blepharitis isn't contagious. Complications Blepharitis isn't usually serious, although it can lead to a number of further problems. For example, many people with blepharitis also develop dry eye syndrome, where the eyes don't produce enough tears or dry out too quickly. This can cause your eyes to feel dry, gritty and sore. Serious, sight-threatening problems are rare, particularly if any complications that develop are identified and treated quickly. Read about the complications of blepharitis.

The aim is to improve hooded or droopy eyelids or eye bags. Before you go ahead, be sure about your reasons for wanting eyelid surgery. Bear in mind the cost, the risks, and the fact the results can't be guaranteed.  It's a good idea to discuss your plans with your GP first. There might be a medical condition affecting your eyelids or a reason why the operation isn't appropriate for you. You can also read Is cosmetic surgery right for me? before making your decision. Read on to find out: How much does eyelid surgery cost?  Where do I go?  What does it involve?  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems  More information  How much does it cost?  In the UK, a blepharoplasty may cost anywhere between £2,000 and £6,000. You should also factor in the cost of any consultations, further surgery or follow-up care that may be needed. Where do I go? If you're looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform eyelid surgery.  All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC. The CQC publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. Also, research the surgeon or ophthalmologist who is going to carry out the surgery. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor's fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many operations they've performed where there have been complications what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? A blepharoplasty can be done under local anaesthetic with sedation or under general anaesthetic. The surgeon would need to know about any medicine you may be taking to reduce your risk of blood clots, such as aspirin or warfarin. Surgery on the upper eyelids generally involves: making a cut (incision) along the eyelid crease in the natural skin fold of the eyelid removing excess skin, fat or muscle closing up the incision \u2013 the scar will be hidden in the natural fold of the eyelid Surgery on the lower eyelids generally involves: making an incision either just below the lower lashes or on the inside of the eyelid moving or removing fat from the bags under the eyes, and sometimes also a small amount of skin supporting the muscles and tendon of the eyelid if necessary The surgeon will normally apply thin, sticky strips called suture strips to support the eyelids after surgery. These are usually removed up to a week later. An upper blepharoplasty may take about one hour. Surgery on the lower lid may take up to two hours. Most patients can go home the same day. Recovery It's advisable to take about a week off work to recover from eyelid surgery. It may be obvious for a little longer than a week that you've just had eyelid surgery. You won't be able to drive for a number of days after the operation. Bruises, scars and redness may take several weeks to fade. You probably need to: prop your head up with pillows for a couple of days when resting to reduce the swelling gently clean your eyelids using prescribed ointment or eyedrops hold a cold pack to your eye for a few days \u2013 try a pack of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from the sun and wind take paracetamol or another prescribed painkiller to relieve any mild pain You should avoid: strenuous activity and swimming for a few days smoking contact lenses and rubbing the eyes Side effects to expect It's common after eyelid surgery to temporarily have: puffy, numb eyelids that are difficult to close at night irritated, sensitive or watery eyes \u2013 this may last a few weeks bruising that looks like a black eye pink scars \u2013 these eventually fade to almost be invisible What could go wrong Eyelid surgery can occasionally result in:  temporary blurred or double vision your eyes looking slightly asymmetrical a pool of blood collecting under the skin (haematoma) \u2013 this usually disappears on its own after a few weeks noticeable scarring Rarely, it can result in more serious problems, including:  injury to eye muscles the lower eyelid drooping away from the eye and turning outwards (ectropion) the lower eyelid becoming pulled down and showing the white of the eye below the iris (eyelid retraction) blindness \u2013 this is extremely rare Also, any type of operation carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding developing a blood clot in a vein infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, patients find the desired effect wasn't achieved and feel they need another operation. What to do if you have problems  Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong, and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms. If you're not happy with the results, or you think the procedure wasn't carried out properly, you should take up the matter with the surgeon who treated you. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC).

Contact your GP or NHS 111 immediately, or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if you also have pain in or around your eye or any loss of vision. The information below should give you an idea of what might be wrong, although it shouldn't be used to self-diagnose your condition. It covers possible causes for the following eyelid problems, plus specific advice about what to do. You can find out about: swollen eyelids or eyelid cysts   itchy, flaky or sticky eyelids  lumps on or around the eyelids  hooded or droopy upper eyelids  rolling outwards of the lower eyelids (ectropion)  rolling inwards of the eyelids (entropion)  yellow plaques on the eyelids  excessive blinking or uncontrollable closure of the eyelids  Swollen eyelid or eyelid cyst It's quite common for the upper or lower eyelid to become swollen because of a meibomian cyst (also called a chalazion). This occurs when the glands in the eyelid become blocked. These cysts vary in size, from barely visible to the size of a grape. They usually take weeks to develop. They're not usually painful, but can become red and painful if infected. The cysts can come and go by themselves, although they may take a few months to get better. You can help them heal by holding a clean flannel warmed in hot water to the closed eye for five minutes, and repeating this three to four times a day for up to four weeks. Speak to your GP if you have a cyst that doesn't clear up after a month. They can refer you to have it drained through a small incision (cut). This is a simple procedure carried out under local anaesthetic (your eye area will be numbed). It takes just a few minutes and rarely leaves a scar. Also see your GP if the cyst becomes infected because you may need to take antibiotics to prevent a deep lid infection (cellulitis). Another common cause of a swelling on the eyelid is a stye. A stye is a minor infection of the base of an eyelash that usually clears up on its own in a week or two. Holding a warm flannel to it regularly may help it heal faster. Read more about treating styes. Other causes of lid swelling include an allergic reaction and shingles on the face and eye (usually with a rash), but these are less common. Itchy, flaky or sticky eyelids Itchy and flaky eyelids are usually caused by an inflamed eyelid edge (blepharitis) or dry eye. Your eyelids may also stick together and be difficult to open, particularly when you wake up. These conditions can be irritating, but are rarely serious. You can reduce the irritation by keeping the eyelids clean and using artificial tears if your eyes are dry. Read about treating blepharitis and treating dry eyes. Contact dermatitis is another possible cause of itchy or flaky eyelids. This is a type of eczema triggered when the skin comes into contact with something you are irritated by or allergic to, such as make-up. The condition usually clears up after you stop using the substance your skin is reacting to. Sticky eyelids along with red and watering eyes can be caused by conjunctivitis, which is when an infection, allergy or irritant causes the front of the eye to become inflamed. This can get better on its own, although your GP may be able to prescribe medication to treat the underlying cause. Read more about treating conjunctivitis. Lumps on or around the eyelids Just like anywhere else on the skin, lumps can occur on or around the eyelids. Many lumps are simple cysts or styes (see above). However, occasionally a lump can be a sign of a more serious condition such as skin cancer and may need to be removed. See your GP if you're worried about a lump on or around your eyelids. Most skin cancers are basal cell carcinomas, which very rarely spread to other parts of the body. These often appear as a red or pink lump containing small blood vessels, although they can be pearly-white or \"waxy\" looking. Sometimes they may bleed. Less commonly, the lump may be a squamous cell carcinoma, which is more serious as there\u2019s a small risk it could spread to other parts of the body. These usually look like an ulcer with a red base and a scaly and crusted surface. You may also lose eyelashes where the lump is growing. In rare cases, the lump could be a sign of a very serious type of skin cancer called melanoma that can spread to other parts of the body and can be very dangerous. A lump is more likely to be melanoma if it's an irregular shape, dark or changing in colour, and getting a lot bigger over time. Hooded or droopy upper eyelids As you get older, it's quite common to have excess skin above the upper eyelids that can overhang and block your vision. This is called dermatochalasis. If it affects your vision, surgery may be considered to remove the excess skin (blepharoplasty). However, this operation isn\u2019t routinely funded on the NHS so your doctor would need to submit a funding request for this to be considered. If the edge of your upper lid droops down over your eye, it's called ptosis. This is usually age-related and develops slowly. Surgery may be needed if the edge of the lid droops so much your vision is affected. In rare cases, ptosis isn't related to age and may be caused by serious conditions such as myasthenia gravis or a brain tumour. In these cases, it's likely there would be other symptoms too. See your GP immediately if ptosis comes on rapidly, over days or weeks, or if it's associated with other symptoms, such as a headache, loss of vision or a change in the size of the pupil (the black dot at the centre of the eye). Lower eyelid that rolls outwards (ectropion)  As you get older, one or both lower eyelids can sometimes droop away from the eye and turn outwards. This is known as an ectropion. The drooping eyelid can disrupt the normal production of tears, which can cause your eye to become dry, red and irritated. Treatment may not be needed in mild cases, although drops or ointment may help make your eye more comfortable. Sometimes a minor operation is needed to correct the position of the eyelid. Read more about treating ectropion. Eyelids that roll inwards (entropion) Entropion is where the eyelid rolls inwards. It usually affects the lower lids, but it can also affect the upper lids. Like ectropion, this is often age-related. Entropion usually causes an uncomfortable watery eye because the lashes irritate the front of the eye (cornea). If this is mild, using eyedrops may be enough to protect the eye and keep you comfortable. Severe entropion can be painful and cause vision loss by damaging the cornea. Occasionally, a corneal ulcer can form and become infected. Surgery may be needed to correct entropion if it's posing a risk to the health of your eye or is causing considerable discomfort. This is carried out under local anaesthetic. If you have entropion, you should discuss your treatment options with your GP. Consult your GP immediately if your eye becomes painful and red and your vision is affected. Yellow plaques on the eyelids Flat yellow patches (plaques) over the upper or lower eyelids are called xanthelasma.  Although these plaques are harmless, they indicate you have high cholesterol. See your GP because you may be at risk of developing cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks and strokes. Making changes to your diet and taking medication may be recommended to reduce your cholesterol level and reduce your risk of serious problems in the future, although these may not improve the plaques. If you're bothered by the appearance of the plaques, it may be possible for them to be surgically removed or treated with a laser. However, this isn't normally funded on the NHS. Excessive blinking or uncontrollable closure of the eyelids It's quite common and normal for the eyelid to flicker or twitch occasionally, particularly when you're tired. It's more unusual to have repeated spasms of excessive blinking and involuntary closure of one or both eyes. This is a type of dystonia (a movement disorder that causes muscle spasms and contractions) known as blepharospasm. Each spasm can last for a few seconds to a few minutes. The exact cause of blepharospasm is unknown. However, the blinking and closure can be triggered by bright light, stress or tiredness. Severe blepharospasm can be very disabling and embarrassing. However, an effective treatment is available. It involves having small injections of botulinum toxin (such as Botox) into the face to relax the muscles controlling the eyelids. In some cases, your GP may consider referring you to a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nerves) for further investigation.

Of these, around 360,000 are registered as blind or partially sighted. Being told you have a visual impairment that can't be treated can be difficult to come to terms with. Some people go through a process similar to bereavement, where they experience a range of emotions including shock, anger, and denial, before eventually coming to accept their condition. If you're blind or partially sighted, you may be referred to a specialist low-vision clinic, which is often located within a hospital. Staff at the clinic can help you understand your condition and come to terms with your diagnosis. They can also advise you about practical things, such as lighting and vision aids, and let you know about further sources of help and support. Ask your local hospital if they have an Eye Clinic Liaison Officer (ECLO), whose role involves providing support to people with vision loss in eye clinics. Support groups If you're blind or partially sighted, you may find it helpful to contact a support group for people with vision loss. Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) is the UK\u2019s leading charity for people with vision loss, and it has a useful page on its website about coming to terms with sight loss. The RNIB's helpline is open Monday to Friday from 8.45am to 5.30pm. The number is 0303 123 9999, with calls costing no more than a standard rate call to an 01 or 02 number. You can also email helpline staff (helpline@rnib.org.uk). The RNIB's website is specially designed for people with sight loss and provides a wide range of useful information and resources, including an online community and online shop. Action for Blind People Action for Blind People is another national charity that provides blind and partially sighted people with practical help and support. For example, the charity can provide you with support and information about the day-to-day practicalities of living with a visual impairment, such as adjusting your home to make it easier to get around. Other national charities Other national charities that specialise in vision loss and you may find useful include: The Macular Society \u2013 helpline: 0300 3030 111 International Glaucoma Association \u2013 helpline: 01233 64 8170 RP Fighting Blindness \u2013 helpline: 0845 123 2354 or email: helpline@rpfightblindness.org.uk Diabetes UK \u2013 0345 123 2399 or email: info@diabetes.org.uk Blind Veterans UK \u2013 020 7723 5021 Local organisations There are also many local voluntary organisations around the country that help and support people with vision problems. You can search by postcode on a website called Visionary to find local support organisations near you. Registering as blind or partially sighted If your vision has deteriorated to a certain level, you may choose to register as visually impaired. Depending on the severity of your vision loss you'll either be registered as sight impaired (previously \"partially sighted\") or severely sight impaired (previously \"blind\"). Your eye specialist (ophthalmologist) will measure your visual acuity (ability to see detail at a distance) and your field of vision (how much you can see from the side of your eye when looking straight ahead). These measurements will help your ophthalmologist determine whether you\u2019re eligible to be certified as sight impaired or severely sight impaired. If you are, they will complete an official certificate with the results of your eye examination. In England and Wales this certificate is called the Certificate of Vision Impairment (CVI), in Scotland it\u2019s called BP1, and in Northern Ireland it\u2019s called A655. Your ophthalmologist will send a copy of the certificate to you, a copy to your GP and a copy to your local social services department. Upon receiving the certificate, your local social services team will contact you to ask whether you want to be added to its register of visually impaired people. After you're registered, social services will contact you again to arrange for an assessment to be carried out. The aim is to assess your needs and find out what help you require to remain independent, such as help with cleaning and cooking, or help with mobility and transport. Registering as visually impaired isn't compulsory, but it can entitle you to a range of benefits including: Disability Living Allowance (DLA) or Personal Independence Payment (PIP) \u2013 a tax-free benefit to help with any costs relating to your disability or illness a reduction in the TV licence fee a tax allowance reduced fees on public transport parking concessions The RNIB website has more information about registering your sight loss. You can also read more about registering vision impairment on GOV.UK. Changes to your home Most visually impaired people can continue to live at home. However, you'll probably need to make some changes to your home, particularly if you live on your own. Below is a list of some important pieces of equipment you may find useful. Big-button telephone \u2013 both landline and mobile models are available from the RNIB online shop. Computer \u2013 the internet can provide a real sense of connection to friends and family as well as other people with a visual impairment. It's also a practical way of finding out information and obtaining goods and services. Big-button keyboards, screen display software and text readers are available from the RNIB. Community alarm \u2013 this small, wearable device has an alarm button which, if pressed, sends an alarm signal to a response centre, which will alert a nominated friend or carer. Your local authority should be able to provide you with further information. Bright lighting \u2013 bright light bulbs and adjustable lights are essential for your home, particularly in the kitchen and the stairs (areas where you're most likely to have an accident). Fluorescent bulbs are recommended because they produce the most light and tend to be cheaper in the long term than conventional bulbs. The way your house is painted can also make it easier to find your way around. Using a two-tone contrast approach, such as black and white, can make it easier to tell the difference between nearby objects, such as a door and its handle or the stairs and its handrail. Reading and writing There are several options available if you're having problems reading standard text in books, newspapers and magazines. One of the simplest options is to use a magnifying device that can make print appear bigger to help you read. These can be obtained from a number of places including hospital low vision services, optometrists, local voluntary organisations, and the RNIB. The RNIB also has a collection of large print publications you can borrow, as do most libraries. You could also use an e-reader to help you read. E-readers are handheld devices that allow you to download books and subscribe to newspapers and magazines on the internet. You can choose a setting that allows you to display text at a larger size. If you're unable to read at all you could sign up to the: National Talking Newspapers and Magazines scheme, which can provide audio versions of more than 230 titles online or on a CD RNIB Talking Books Service, where you're sent audio books to listen to on your computer or on a device known as a DAISY player You can also install screen-reading software on your computer that will read out emails, documents and text on the internet. A charity called Communication for Blind and Disabled People has released a free screen reader for the PC called Thunder. Similar software is available for Apple devices, although you may have to pay a small fee. There are also voice recognition programmes where you speak into a microphone and the software translates what you say into writing. These programmes can also be used to issue commands, such as closing down the internet and moving from one website to another. Braille Some people with severe sight loss, particularly those who've had the problem from a young age, choose to learn Braille. Braille is a writing system where raised dots are used as a substitute for written letters. As well as Braille versions of books and magazines, you can buy Braille display units, which can be attached to computers that allow you to read the text displayed on a computer screen. Braille computer keyboards are also available. The RNIB website has more information about reading and Braille. Getting around There are several different methods you can use to get around independently if you have a problem with your vision. Long cane You may find a long cane useful when travelling. These type of canes are usually foldable and can help you get around by detecting objects in your path. The cane will also make drivers and other pedestrians aware that you have sight loss. To get the most from a long cane, it's a good idea to attend a training course that will teach you how to use it. The RNIB or Guide Dogs can provide you with further details about training. Guide dogs The charity Guide Dogs has been providing guide dogs for people with vision loss for many years. Guide dogs can help you get around, and provide both a sense of independence and companionship. If you apply for a guide dog, Guide Dogs provide all the essential equipment free of charge and can also offer financial assistance if needed for things like food or vet costs. You don't need to have lost all your sight to benefit from a guide dog and you don't have to be officially registered as blind or partially-sighted to apply for one. The Guide Dogs website has more information about applying for a guide dog. Guide Dogs also offer a number of other services for people with a visual impairment (even if you don't have a guide dog), such as Children and Young People's Services and mobility training. The charity also provides the My Guide service, which aims to reduce the isolation that many people with sight loss experience, helping to rebuild their confidence and regain their independence. Global positioning system (GPS) A global positioning system (GPS) is a navigational aid that uses signals from satellites to tell you where you are and help plan your journeys. GPS devices are available as stand-alone units that can be programmed using a Braille keyboard, which tell you your current location and give you directions to where you want to go. If you have a smartphone, there are a number of GPS apps you can download. The RNIB website has more information about technology and products for people with sight loss, including GPS. Driving If you're diagnosed with a condition that affects your vision, you have a legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). Failure to do so is a crime and can result in a fine of up to £1,000. Visit GOV.UK for more information about driving with a disability or a health condition. If you're registered as having a sight impairment, the DVLA will assume your driving licence is no longer valid and you'll no longer be able to drive. Exceptions are occasionally made for people with mild vision impairment. If you think this applies to you, then your doctor will need to fill in a DVLA medical information questionnaire (PDF, 265kb). You're only legally allowed to drive if you can read a number plate from a distance of 20 metres (65 feet), and an eye test shows your visual acuity is at least 6\/12. You're allowed to wear glasses or contact lenses when reading the plate or letter chart. There are also standards relating to your visual field and driving. If you have a condition that may reduce your visual field, the DVLA may ask you to complete a visual field test to demonstrate you're safe to drive. Employment If you're currently employed and have recently been diagnosed with a visual impairment, you should contact the Access to Work scheme. Access to Work is a scheme run by Jobcentre Plus that provides advice and support about what equipment and adjustments may be required to enable you to do your job. They also offer a grant to contribute towards the costs of any equipment or training you may need, such as voice recognition software, a Braille keyboard and display unit and a printer that can convert text into Braille (Braille embossers). Depending on the size of the company you work for, the grant can pay for 80-100% of costs, up to £10,000. If you're currently looking for work, there are three main organisations that can provide extra advice and support: The RNIB, which has a useful section on its website about looking for work Jobcentre Plus  Action for Blind People  You don't have to disclose that you have a visual impairment when applying for a job, but it's usually recommended that you do. If you feel you've been turned down for a job because of your disability, and you were capable of doing the job, you can make a complaint under the Equality Act 2010. Some people with a visual impairment decide to become self-employed, often because it allows them the flexibility to work at home for hours they choose. Action for Blind People has self-employment advisers who can provide information and training on issues such as drawing up a business plan, obtaining funding and book-keeping. The RNIB website has more information and advice about work and employment. You can also read more about employment on the Action for Blind People website. Regular sight tests If you have vision loss, it's still important to have regular sight tests so your optometrist (eye specialist) can check for further changes in your eyes and give you advice about how to make the best use of your vision. Find an optician near you and read more about NHS eye care services.

Fluid collects under the damaged skin, cushioning the tissue underneath. This protects the tissue from further damage and allows it to heal. Most blisters are filled with a clear fluid (serum), but may be filled with blood (blood blisters) or pus if they become inflamed or infected. Treating blisters Most blisters heal naturally after three to seven days and don't require medical attention. It's important to avoid bursting the blister, because this could lead to an infection or slow down the healing process. If the blister does burst, don't peel off the dead skin. Instead, allow the fluid inside the blister to drain and cover the area with a dry, sterile dressing to protect it from infection until it heals. Read more about treating blisters. When to see your GP See your GP if you have blisters that: you think are infected are very painful keep coming back An infected blister will be filled with yellow or green pus and may be painful, red and hot. It's important not to ignore an infected blister because it could lead to secondary impetigo (a contagious bacterial infection of the skin) and further complications, such as cellulitis or sepsis. You should also talk to your GP if you have blisters in unusual places, such as on your eyelids or inside your mouth, or if they appear after severe sunburn, burns or scalds or an allergic reaction, or after coming into contact with chemicals or other substances. What causes blisters? Blisters can be caused by: friction to the skin heat \u2013 for example, from sunburn or a scald contact with chemicals, such as detergent medical conditions, such as chickenpox and impetigo Read more about what causes blisters. Preventing blisters There are a number of things you can do to avoid getting blisters caused by friction, sunburn or chemicals. For example, you can: wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes help keep your feet dry with thicker socks or talcum powder wear gloves when handling chemicals use sunscreen Read more about preventing blisters.

Sit down to eat and take regular exercise. Most of us have experienced the feeling of being bloated, when your tummy is stretched, puffy and uncomfortable. It often happens after a big weekend or over a festive season. But for some people, bloating is more than an occasional inconvenience. If your stomach or tummy often feels bloated, it could be due to: excess wind   constipation swallowing air (from talking while eating etc) Coeliac disease  food intolerance irritable bowel syndrome  Excess wind and bloating Cut down on foods known to cause wind and bloating, such as: beans onions broccoli cabbage sprouts cauliflower But make sure you still eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Read how to keep up your fruit and veg intake while cutting down on bloating. Constipation and bloating If you get constipation, take steps to prevent it with a fibre-rich diet, drinking lots of fluids and taking regular exercise. Even a 20-30 minute brisk walk four times a week can improve your bowel function. Read about how to eat more fibre. Swallowing air and bloating Try not to swallow too much air. Don\u2019t talk and eat at the same time, sit down to eat (sitting upright and not slumped over), reduce the amount of fizzy drinks you consume, stop chewing gum and chew with your mouth closed so that you\u2019re not taking in excess air. Use these smart swaps for cutting out fizzy drinks. Coeliac disease and bloating Coeliac disease is a common digestive condition where your intestine can't absorb gluten found in wheat, barley and rye. Pure oats do not contain gluten, but people with coeliac disease may need to also avoid oats as they are often processed in factories that also process wheat and there is a risk of cross-contamination. Apart from bloating, if you have Coeliac disease, eating foods containing gluten can also trigger diarrhoea, abdominal pain and fatigue. See your GP for a blood test if you suspect you may have Coeliac disease. There is no cure for Coeliac disease but, once the condition has been diagnosed, switching to a gluten-free diet should help. Read more about Coeliac disease. Food intolerance and bloating Food intolerance can lead to bloating when: Your bowel doesn\u2019t empty properly. The food causes gas to be trapped. Too much gas is produced as a reaction to the food. The main offenders are wheat or gluten and dairy products. The best approach if you have a food intolerance is to eat less of the culprit food or cut it out completely. Keep a food diary for a couple of weeks, noting everything that you eat and drink and when bloating troubles you most. But don't get rid of food groups long-term without advice from your GP. Find out whether you should cut out bread to stop bloating. Read more about food intolerance. Irritable bowel syndrome and bloating People with irritable bowel syndrome often complain of bloating, especially in the evening. The bloating of IBS doesn\u2019t seem to be linked with excess wind. It\u2019s thought to be down to erratic propulsion of contents through the bowel. It can help to cut down on fatty or high-fibre foods. Peppermint tea or capsules and probiotics have also been reported to help ease IBS symptoms. Read more about IBS and its treatment. If your bloating symptoms persist, consult your GP to rule out a more serious condition. Bloating, and a persistent feeling of fullness, are key symptoms of ovarian cancer.

It usually affects the back of the nose, the throat or the sinuses (air-filled cavities in the bones of the face). It's often temporary, but some people experience it for months or years. This is known as chronic catarrh. Catarrh can be a nuisance and may be difficult to get rid of, but it's not harmful and there are treatments available. This page covers: Symptoms associated with catarrh Treatments for catarrh When to see your GP What causes catarrh? Symptoms associated with catarrh Catarrh can lead to a: constant need to clear your throat feeling that your throat is blocked blocked or stuffy nose that you can't clear runny nose feeling of mucus running down the back of your throat persistent cough headache or facial pain reduced sense of smell and taste crackling sensation in your ear and some temporary hearing loss These problems can be frustrating to live with and may affect your sleep, making you feel tired. Treatments for catarrh Catarrh will often pass in a few days or weeks as the condition that causes it improves. See What causes catarrh? below for more information. There are things you can try at home to relieve your symptoms, such as: avoiding things that trigger your symptoms, such as allergens or smoky places taking sips of cold water when you feel the need to clear your throat \u2013 constantly clearing your throat may make things worse using a saline nasal rinse several times a day \u2013 these can be bought from a pharmacy or made at home with half a teaspoon of salt in a pint of boiled water that's been left to cool avoiding warm, dry atmospheres, such as places with air conditioning and car heating systems \u2013 placing plants or bowls of water in a room may help to keep the air humid staying well hydrated talking to a pharmacist about suitable over-the-counter medications \u2013 including decongestants, antihistamines or steroid nasal sprays There are also several remedies, such as herbal medicines, available from health shops and pharmacies that claim to treat catarrh. Some people find these helpful, but there's generally little scientific evidence to suggest they work. When to see your GP Speak to your GP if your catarrh persists and is becoming difficult to live with. They may want to rule out conditions that could be causing it, such as nasal polyps or allergies. This may mean you need to be referred to a specialist for tests. If you're diagnosed with a specific underlying condition, treating it may help relieve your catarrh. For example, nasal polyps may be treated with a steroid nasal spray, or in some cases surgery.  Read more about treating nasal polyps. If a cause for you catarrh cannot be found, the self-help techniques above may be recommended. Unfortunately, however, chronic catarrh can be hard to treat and may last for a long time. What causes catarrh? Catarrh is usually caused by the immune system reacting to an infection or irritation, which causes the lining of your nose and throat to become swollen and produce mucus. This can be triggered by: a cold or other infections hay fever or other types of allergic rhinitis non-allergic rhinitis nasal polyps It's unclear what causes chronic catarrh, but it's not thought to be the result of an allergy or infection. It may be related to an abnormality in the way mucus travels within the nose or an increased sensitivity to mucus in the back of the nose and throat.

It's known as venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is a serious, potentially fatal, medical condition. VTE is the collective name for: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) \u2013 a blood clot in in one of the deep veins in the body, usually in one of the legs pulmonary embolism \u2013 a blood clot in the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs Although serious, most blood clots can be completely avoided. The key is to be aware if you're at risk and take some simple preventative steps. This article is about blood clots in veins. If you want information on blood clots in arteries, which is a common cause of heart attack and stroke, see the topic on arterial thrombosis. Who gets blood clots? Anyone can get a blood clot, but you're more at risk if you can\u2019t move around much or if you\u2019re unwell. You\u2019ve probably heard of blood clots linked to long-haul plane journeys or the contraceptive pill, but most blood clots actually develop during or just after a stay in hospital. Your risk is also increased if you: are over 60 years old are overweight or obese have had a blood clot before are having hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are pregnant or have recently given birth are dehydrated have cancer or are having cancer treatment have a condition that causes your blood to clot more easily than normal, such as antiphospholipid syndrome The rest of this topic will focus on blood clots linked with admission to hospital. Hospital-acquired blood clots In 2005, a House of Commons Health Committee report stated that every year in England an estimated 25,000 deaths occur as a result of hospital-acquired VTE. The report also stated that the estimated number of deaths due to VTE, \"is more than the combined total of deaths from breast cancer, AIDS and traffic accidents, and more than 25 times the number who die from MRSA\". The government recognises that deaths from hospital blood clots are preventable and has recommended that all patients admitted to hospital should be assessed for their risk of developing blood clots, and measures to reduce this risk should be taken when appropriate. Assessing your risk of blood clots When you arrive at hospital, you should be checked for your risk of blood clots. Hospital staff will record your age and weight and ask you about your general health. The assessment will also take into account the reason for your hospital stay. Your risk of clots is likely to be higher, for instance, if you're having a major operation, if you're going to be confined to bed for long periods, or if you have any of the other \"risk factors\" mentioned above. If the assessment shows that you're at risk of a blood clot, you should be offered preventative treatment. The options include blood-thinning medication (anticoagulants) and compression stockings or foot pumps to keep your blood circulating and help prevent any clots forming. Hospital staff should check whether bleeding might be a problem before offering medication to help prevent clots. If you've been admitted to hospital and you haven't had your blood clot risk checked, it's important that you ask a doctor or nurse. Equally, if you've been told you're at risk of clots and have been given medicine, stockings or other devices, it's important that you understand how to use them properly. Don't be afraid to ask hospital staff about reducing your risk of blood clots \u2013 it could save your life. Questions you might like to ask your healthcare team about blood clots are: am I at risk of blood clots? how likely am I to have bleeding problems? what happens if I have problems with a medication or treatment I am having to help prevent clots? Reducing your risk of blood clots There are things you and the medical professionals looking after you can do before, during and after your hospital stay to minimise your risk of developing a blood clot. Before coming into hospital You can help yourself before coming into hospital by: trying to lose any excess weight keeping as mobile as you can talking to your doctor if you take HRT or the combined contraceptive pill \u2013 you may need to stop them a few weeks before your operation While in hospital While you're in hospital, you will reduce your chances of a blood clot if you: drink plenty of fluids to keep hydrated wear your compression stockings day and night (except when you're washing) wear any other compression devices you've been given take any blood-thinning medicines you've been offered get up and move around as soon as you're advised to After leaving hospital You're still at risk of developing a blood clot in the days and weeks after leaving hospital, so you might be advised to continue preventative measures for a short period. Your care team will discuss this with you before you are discharged. You may be given compression stockings to wear until you are fully mobile, and you may need to keep using anticoagulants for several weeks. You should also take care to stay as mobile as possible and keep yourself well hydrated. How to tell if you have a blood clot Before leaving hospital, you should be told about anything you need to look out for that could suggest you've developed a blood clot. Symptoms of a blood clot can include: cramping pain, redness, warmth, or swelling in one of your legs \u2013 these are symptoms of DVT breathlessness, chest pain, fainting or coughing up blood \u2013 these are symptoms of a pulmonary embolism If you develop symptoms of a blood clot, see your GP or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible. Blood clots can be treated if they're spotted in time. Read more about treating blood clots.

It's very dangerous, because it can obstruct the flow of blood to major organs. Depending on where the clot forms, arterial thrombosis can cause several serious conditions, including: heart attack \u2013 when blood flow to the heart is suddenly blocked  stroke \u2013 when blood flow to the brain is cut off  peripheral arterial disease (PAD), also known as peripheral vascular disease (PVD) \u2013 when a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries restricts the blood supply to leg muscles Heart attack and stroke are two of the leading causes of death in the UK. Who's at risk? Most cases of arterial thrombosis are caused when an artery is damaged by atherosclerosis. This is where fatty deposits called plaque build up on the walls of the arteries, causing them to harden and narrow. If the plaque ruptures (bursts), a blood clot may develop. Your risk of developing an arterial blood clot is increased if you: eat a high-fat diet smoke drink more units of alcohol than the recommended amount (men shouldn't regularly drink more than 3-4 units a day and women shouldn't regularly drink more than 2-3 units a day) are obese don't do regular exercise have diabetes (either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes) have high blood pressure (hypertension) have high cholesterol The risk of arterial thrombosis also increases with age, so older people are more commonly affected. Treating arterial thrombosis It's sometimes possible to treat arterial thrombosis with medication or surgery. Medication In some cases, a type of medication called a thrombolytic can be used to dissolve blood clots and restore the blood flow in an artery. Examples of thrombolytic medicines include alteplase and reteplase. These medicines are most effective if they're used as soon as possible after a heart attack or stroke starts. Surgery Surgery for arterial thrombosis involves unblocking the affected artery or re-routing the flow of blood around the blockage. The type of surgery used will depend on the location and severity of your condition. For example, you may need heart surgery if the blood clot is in an artery that supplies blood to your heart. Operations used to treat this include: coronary stent placement \u2013 where a balloon is inflated in a blocked artery (angioplasty) to allow a hollow metal tube called a stent to be used to widen the artery and stop it from becoming blocked again coronary artery bypass graft \u2013 where a blood vessel taken from another part of the body is used to bypass the point of the blockage If you have a blood clot in your neck, you may have a type of surgery called carotid endarterectomy. During this operation, the surgeon makes a cut in your neck to open up the artery and remove the fatty deposits. Reducing your risk It isn't possible to entirely prevent blood clots from forming, but there are numerous ways you can minimise your risk. Medication If you've previously had a blood clot, you may need to take medicines to reduce the risk of it happening again. These include: statins to lower your blood cholesterol levels  anticoagulant medicines \u2013 such as warfarin, sinthrone, dabigatran, apixiban, rivaroxaban, or antiplatelet medicines, such as low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel, to thin the blood and reduce the risk of clotting antihypertensive medicines to reduce high blood pressure \u2013 such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors Lifestyle You can also reduce your risk of developing arterial thrombosis and heart disease by: not smoking reducing the amount of salt you eat cutting down on fat (particularly saturated fat) eating at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day doing a minimum of 150 minutes (2 hours 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity exercise a week, such as fast walking, cycling or water aerobics (read more about the physical activity guidelines for adults) Other types of blood clot As well as arterial thrombosis, there are several other types of blood clot, including: venous thromboembolism (VTE) \u2013 a blood clot that develops in a vein deep vein thrombosis (DVT) \u2013 a blood clot in one of the deep veins in the body, usually in the leg embolism \u2013 a condition where the blood flow in an artery is blocked by a foreign body, such as a blood clot or an air bubble pulmonary embolism \u2013 a blood clot in the pulmonary artery, which is the blood vessel that transports blood from the heart to the lungs Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 18\/02\/2015 Next review due: 18\/02\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

DVT usually occurs in a deep leg vein, a larger vein that runs through the muscles of the calf and the thigh. It can cause pain and swelling in the leg and may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism. This is a serious condition that occurs when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream and blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs (see below). DVT and pulmonary embolism together are known as venous thromboembolism (VTE). Symptoms of DVT In some cases, there may be no symptoms of DVT. If symptoms do occur they can include: pain, swelling and tenderness in one of your legs (usually your calf) a heavy ache in the affected area warm skin in the area of the clot red skin, particularly at the back of your leg below the knee DVT usually (although not always) affects one leg. The pain may be worse when you bend your foot upward towards your knee. Pulmonary embolism If left untreated, about one in 10 people with a DVT will develop a pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary embolism is a very serious condition which causes: breathlessness \u2013 which may come on gradually or suddenly chest pain \u2013 which may become worse when you breathe in sudden collapse  Both DVT and pulmonary embolism require urgent investigation and treatment. Seek immediate medical attention if you have pain, swelling and tenderness in your leg and you develop breathlessness and chest pain. Read more about the complications of DVT. What causes DVT? Each year, DVT affects around one person in every 1,000 in the UK. Anyone can develop DVT, but it becomes more common over the age of 40. As well as age, there are also a number of other risk factors, including: having a history of DVT or pulmonary embolism having a family history of blood clots being inactive for long periods \u2013 such as after an operation or during a long journey blood vessel damage \u2013 a damaged blood vessel wall can result in the formation of a blood clot having certain conditions or treatments that cause your blood to clot more easily than normal \u2013 such as cancer (including chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment), heart and lung disease, thrombophilia and Hughes syndrome being pregnant \u2013 your blood also clots more easily during pregnancy being overweight or obese The combined contraceptive pill and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) both contain the female hormone oestrogen, which causes the blood to clot more easily. If you're taking either of these, your risk of developing DVT is slightly increased. Read more about the causes of DVT. Diagnosing DVT See your GP as soon as possible if you think you may have DVT \u2013 for example, if you have pain, swelling and a heavy ache in your leg. They'll ask you about your symptoms and medical history. D-dimer test It can be difficult to diagnose DVT from symptoms alone, so your GP may advise that you have a specialised blood test called a D-dimer test. This test detects pieces of blood clot that have been broken down and are loose in your bloodstream. The larger the number of fragments found, the more likely it is that you have a blood clot in your vein. However, the D-dimer test isn't always reliable because blood clot fragments can increase after an operation, injury or during pregnancy. Additional tests, such as an ultrasound scan, will need to be carried out to confirm DVT. Ultrasound scan An ultrasound scan can be used to detect clots in your veins. A special type of ultrasound called a Doppler ultrasound can also be used to find out how fast the blood is flowing through a blood vessel. This helps doctors identify when blood flow is slowed or blocked, which could be caused by a blood clot. Venogram A venogram may be used if the results of a D-dimer test and ultrasound scan can't confirm a diagnosis of DVT. During a venogram, a liquid called a contrast dye is injected into a vein in your foot. The dye travels up the leg and can be detected by X-ray, which will highlight a gap in the blood vessel where a clot is stopping the flow of blood. Treating DVT Treatment for DVT usually involves taking anticoagulant medicines, which reduce the blood's ability to clot and stop existing clots getting bigger. Heparin and warfarin are two types of anticoagulant often used to treat DVT. Heparin is usually prescribed first because it works immediately to prevent further clotting. After initial treatment, you may also need to take warfarin to prevent another blood clot forming. A number of anticoagulants, known as directly acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), may also be used to treat conditions such as DVT. These medications include rivaroxaban and apixaban, and they've been shown to be as effective as heparin and warfarin with less serious side effects. You'll also be prescribed compression stockings to wear every day, which will improve your symptoms and help prevent complications. Read more about treating DVT. Preventing DVT If you need to go into hospital for surgery, a member of your care team will assess your risk of developing a blood clot while you're there. If you're at risk of developing DVT, there are a number of things you can do to prevent a blood clot occurring, both before you go into hospital, such as temporarily stopping taking the combined contraceptive pill, and while you're in hospital, such as wearing compression stockings. When you leave hospital, your care team may also make a number of recommendations to help prevent DVT returning or complications developing. These may include: not smoking eating a healthy, balanced diet taking regular exercise  maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if you're obese There's no evidence to suggest that taking aspirin reduces your risk of developing DVT. See your GP before embarking on long-distance travel if you're at risk of getting a DVT, or if you've had a DVT in the past. When taking a long-distance journey (six hours or more) by plane, train or car, you should take steps to avoid getting DVT, such as drinking plenty of water, performing simple leg exercises and taking regular, short walking breaks.

It's estimated that around 25,000 people who are admitted to hospital die from preventable blood clots each year. The Department of Health has made the prevention of DVT a priority across the NHS. All patients admitted to hospital should be assessed for their risk of developing a blood clot and, if necessary, given preventative treatment. This recommendation was made by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2010. For more information, see the NICE guidance about venous thromboembolism: reducing the risk for patients in hospital.

This blockage \u2013 usually a blood clot \u2013 is potentially life-threatening because it can prevent blood from reaching your lungs. The symptoms of a pulmonary embolism can sometimes be difficult to recognise because they can vary between individuals. However, the main symptoms include: chest pain \u2013 a sharp, stabbing pain that may be worse when you breathe in shortness of breath \u2013 which can come on suddenly or develop gradually coughing \u2013 this is usually dry, but may include coughing up blood or mucus that contains blood feeling faint, dizzy or passing out You should visit your GP as soon as possible if you have a combination of these symptoms. If your symptoms are particularly severe, dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Read more about diagnosing a pulmonary embolism. What causes a pulmonary embolism? A pulmonary embolism is often caused by a blood clot travelling up from one of the deep veins in your legs to your heart and lungs. A blood clot in one of the deep veins of the legs is known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT can occur for no apparent reason, but it often develops after long periods of inactivity, such as during a long-haul flight or if you're ill in hospital. DVT can also occur during pregnancy or as a result of some medical conditions, such as cancer or heart failure, or if the wall of a blood vessel becomes damaged. Read more about the causes of a pulmonary embolism. Diagnosing a pulmonary embolism Diagnosing a pulmonary embolism can be difficult because the symptoms are common to many other conditions. However, an accurate diagnosis is important because treating a pulmonary embolism isn't always easy and the treatment used can cause side effects. A number of tests can help determine whether you have a pulmonary embolism or rule out other causes of your symptoms. For example, you may have a chest X-ray or tests to check how well your lungs are working. Read more about how a pulmonary embolism is diagnosed. How a pulmonary embolism is treated Pulmonary embolisms are treated with anticoagulant medicines. These stop the blood clot getting bigger while your body slowly reabsorbs it, and reduce your risk of further clots developing. If you're diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism, you'll usually be given regular anticoagulant injections for about five days to begin with. You'll also be prescribed an anticoagulant tablet called warfarin to take for several months. As part of your treatment, you'll need regular blood tests to check that the dose of warfarin you're receiving is correct. If the dose is too high you may experience bleeding and if it's too low you may have further blood clots. Keeping mobile will also help you maintain good blood circulation and prevent further blood clots forming. Read more about treating a pulmonary embolism. Preventing a pulmonary embolism A number of methods may be recommended to prevent a pulmonary embolism if you're at risk of developing blood clots. These include: taking anticoagulant tablets, such as warfarin wearing compression stockings or using compression devices avoiding long periods of inactivity leading a healthy lifestyle, such as giving up smoking (if you smoke) and eating a healthy, balanced diet low in fat and including plenty of fruit and vegetables Read more about preventing a pulmonary embolism.

Blood donations are an essential part of our healthcare system. If we did not have volunteers giving blood, many medical procedures we take for granted could not take place. Doctors and surgeons rely on blood donations to carry out life-saving and life-enhancing treatments every day. How can I donate blood? Thousands of blood donation sessions are held each year by NHS Blood and Transplant, so it's usually possible to attend one that is convenient for you. You will need to answer some questions about your health and have a quick blood test before you can donate blood. This is to ensure there is no danger to yourself or someone else. During a blood donation, a needle is used to collect 470ml (just under one pint) of your blood. You will need to rest for a short while after a donation, and refreshments will be offered to stop you feeling faint or dizzy. It is usually recommended that men allow 12 weeks and women 16 weeks between donations. Read more about how blood donations are performed. How is donated blood used? In most cases, your blood will be separated into its component parts so it can be used to treat a variety of conditions. These components are: red blood cells \u2013 used to treat some types of anaemia and replace blood lost as the result of an accident platelets \u2013 used to treat problems with bone marrow, such as leukaemia and people with blood clotting disorders plasma \u2013 used to treat conditions where abnormal clotting causes bleeding, such as liver disease, and where large volumes of blood have been lost Donated blood may also be used to improve the quality of life of people with a terminal illness. Read more about how blood donations are used. Other types of blood donation There are other types of blood donation that can be used to treat a number of conditions. Cord blood donation Cord blood \u2013 from the placenta and umbilical cord \u2013 can be donated after a baby has been born. However, a decision must be made before the birth. Cord blood, which is rich in stem cells, can be used to treat a number of conditions, such as leukaemia. Read more about cord blood donation. Platelet donation If you have a high platelet count in your blood, you may be able to directly donate platelets. The process is similar to giving blood normally, but often takes a bit longer. Read more about platelet donation. Who can donate blood? Most people between the ages of 17 and 66 can donate blood, although you must be in good general health. To reduce the risk to recipients of donated blood, there are rules about who can and cannot donate. For example, people who have ever had HIV, syphilis or hepatitis C can never donate blood. Having a recent tattoo, piercing or taking certain medication, may also mean you cannot donate blood. Read more about who can donate blood. More blood donors are needed Although most people are able to give blood, only about 4% of the population donate regularly. In England, around 8,000 blood transfusions are carried out every day, so there's a need for blood donations. As blood can only be safely stored for a relatively short time, hospital blood stocks need to be continuously refreshed. Red blood cells can only be stored for 35 days and platelets (the part of the blood that helps prevent excessive bleeding) can only be stored for seven days. In particular, blood donations are needed from black and Asian people because the current levels of black and Asian donors are very low. Certain ethnic groups often require certain blood types, so having donations from a wide range of ethnic groups is a more effective way of meeting the potential demand for blood. Find out more about current blood stocks from NHS Blood and Transplant. NHS Blood and Transplant In England and parts of Wales, the blood donation process is overseen by NHS Blood and Transplant. This service relies on voluntary donations from the general public to keep the service running. Donating blood is a relatively quick procedure (it usually takes less than an hour) and is virtually painless. The NHS Blood and Transplant website provides more information about how you can volunteer to give blood. You can also book an appointment to donate blood near to where you live or work.

Your blood group is determined by the genes you inherit from your parents. Each group can be either RhD positive or RhD negative, which means your blood group can be one of the eight types shown below (see the Rh system). What is blood? Your body carries around four to six litres (7 to 10.5 pints) of blood. Blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in a liquid called plasma. Plasma is about 90% water, but also contains proteins, nutrients, hormones and waste products. Blood is made up of about 60% plasma and 40% blood cells. Each type of blood cell has a specific role to play: red blood cells carry oxygen around the body and remove carbon dioxide and other waste products; they give blood its red colour white blood cells are part of the immune system (the body's natural defence mechanism) and help fight infection platelets help the blood clot (thicken) to stop bleeding Antigens and antibodies Your blood group is identified by antigens and antibodies in the blood. Antibodies are part of your body's natural defences against invading substances such as germs. Antigens are protein molecules found on the surface of red blood cells. Antibodies are proteins found in plasma. Antibodies recognise anything foreign in your body and alert your immune system to destroy it. The ABO system There are four main blood groups defined by the ABO system: blood group A has A antigens on the red blood cells with anti-B antibodies in the plasma blood group B has B antigens with anti-A antibodies in the plasma blood group O has no antigens, but both anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the plasma blood group AB has both A and B antigens, but no antibodies Almost half (48%) of the UK population has blood group O, making this the most common blood group.  Receiving blood from the wrong ABO group can be life threatening.  For example, the anti-A antibodies in a recipient with group B blood will attack the group A cells if transfused to them. This is why group A blood must never be given to a group B person. As group O red blood cells don't have any A or B antigens, it can safely be given to any other group. The NHS Blood and Transplant website has more information about the different blood groups. The Rh system Red blood cells sometimes have another antigen, a protein known as the RhD antigen. If this is present, your blood group is RhD positive. If it's absent, your blood group is RhD negative. This means you can be one of eight blood groups: A RhD positive (A+) A RhD negative (A-) B RhD positive (B+) B RhD negative (B-) O RhD positive (O+) O RhD negative (O-) AB RhD positive (AB+) AB RhD negative (AB-) About 85% of the UK population is RhD positive (36% of the population has O+, the most common type). In most cases, O RhD negative blood (O-) can safely be given to anyone. It's often used in medical emergencies when the blood type isn't immediately known. It's safe for most users because it doesn't have any A, B or RhD antigens on the surface of the cells, and is compatible with every other ABO and RhD blood group.  Blood group test To work out your blood group, your red cells are mixed with different antibody solutions. If, for example, the solution contains anti-B antibodies and you have B antigens on your cells (you are blood group B), it will clump together. If the blood doesn't react to any of the anti-A or anti-B antibodies, it's blood group O. A series of tests with different types of antibody can be used to identify your blood group. If you have a blood transfusion (where blood is taken from one person and given to another), your blood will be tested against a sample of donor cells that contain ABO and RhD antigens. If there's no reaction, donor blood with the same ABO and RhD type can be used. Pregnancy Pregnant women are always given a blood group test. This is because if the mother is RhD negative but the child has inherited RhD-positive blood from the father, it could cause complications if left untreated. RhD-negative women of child-bearing age should always only receive RhD-negative blood. Read more about Rhesus disease. Giving blood Most people are able to give blood, but only 4% actually do.

It's more a cause for concern in older people, particularly those who smoke. The medical term for coughing up blood is haemoptysis. You may cough up small amounts of bright red blood, or frothy blood-streaked sputum (saliva and phlegm). The blood is usually from your lungs and is often the result of prolonged coughing or a chest infection. If the blood is dark and contains bits of food or what look like coffee grounds, it may be coming from your digestive system. This is a more serious problem and you should go to hospital straight away. Read more about vomiting blood. What to do if you cough up blood See your GP as soon as possible if you cough up blood. It's particularly important to see your GP if: you cough up more than a few teaspoons of blood you also have chest pain, dizziness, fever, light-headedness or worsening shortness of breath you have a loss of appetite or unexplained weight loss there's also blood in your urine or blood in your stools Your GP will be able to assess whether you may have a serious medical condition that needs to be investigated and treated. Call NHS 111 or your local out of hours service if you can't see your GP. Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately if you're coughing up significant amounts of blood or are struggling to breathe. Tests that may be needed You may be asked for a sample of your sputum so it can be checked for infection. Other tests, such as blood tests, may also be needed. Your GP may decide to refer you to a specialist at your local hospital for a chest X-ray or a more detailed scan, such as a computerised tomography (CT) scan. In some cases, further tests may be required to find out where the blood is coming from. For example, you may be referred to a specialist who may decide to arrange a test called a bronchoscopy (where the main air passages of your lungs are examined using a tube with a camera at one end). This page can give you a better idea of what the cause may be, but don't use it to diagnose yourself. Always leave that to a doctor. Common causes of coughing up blood The most common reasons for coughing up blood are: a prolonged, severe cough a chest infection \u2013 this is more likely if your sputum is discoloured or contains pus, you have a fever, or you have a tight feeling in your chest bronchiectasis \u2013 this is more likely if you're also wheezy or short of breath Sometimes a severe nosebleed or bleeding from the mouth or throat can cause blood to come out in your saliva when you cough. Less common causes of coughing up blood Less commonly, coughing up blood may be the result of: pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lungs) \u2013 this usually causes sudden shortness of breath and chest pain pulmonary oedema (fluid in the lungs) \u2013 your sputum will be pink and frothy, and this usually occurs in people with pre-existing heart problems lung cancer \u2013 this is more likely if you're over 40 and smoke tuberculosis (TB) \u2013 a severe lung infection associated with fever and sweating; this is becoming more common in the UK, but can be treated with prolonged antibiotics  cancer of the throat or windpipe taking anticoagulants \u2013 medications that help stop your blood clotting, such as warfarin, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran Sometimes, no cause can be found and it never happens again.

The semen may be blood stained, brownish-red in colour or have a pink tinge. This page is intended to give you a better idea of the possible causes, but you shouldn't use it to diagnose yourself with a condition \u2013 always see your GP for a proper diagnosis. In many cases, no obvious cause can be found for blood in the semen and it will clear up by itself. Common causes Common causes of blood in semen include: vesiculitis \u2013 inflammation of the seminal vesicles (glands that produce most of the fluid in ejaculate) seminal vesicle cysts \u2013 small, fluid-filled sacs in the seminal vesicles prostatitis \u2013 inflammation of the prostate gland (where semen is made) recent urological surgery \u2013 such as a prostate biopsy, cystoscopy or vasectomy sexually transmitted infections (STIs) \u2013 such as genital herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhoea or trichomoniasis These problems generally aren't serious and many will get better on their own without treatment, or after a course of antibiotics or anti-inflammatory painkillers. Less common causes Less often, blood in the semen can be a result of: severe high blood pressure (hypertension) a blood clotting disorder cancer \u2013 including prostate cancer, testicular cancer and bladder cancer seminal vesicle calculi \u2013 small stones in the seminal vesicles These conditions are more serious and may require specialist treatment. Seeing your GP Your GP will try to determine whether the cause of the blood in your semen is likely to be serious or not. They'll need to consider a number of things, such as: how many times you've noticed blood in your semen whether you have any other symptoms your age your medical history They may also need to carry out a number of simple tests, including: checking your blood pressure an examination of your genitals and abdomen (tummy) a rectal examination (where your doctor inserts a finger into your bottom) urine and blood tests If you're younger than 40, have only noticed blood in your semen once or twice, and tests don't suggest you have a serious underlying condition, you shouldn't need a hospital referral. However, if you're over 40, have persistent or recurrent symptoms, or tests have suggested a potentially serious underlying cause, your GP should refer you to a urologist (specialist who treats problems of the urinary system). A further assessment with a urologist may involve having a biopsy of your prostate gland or a scan, such as an ultrasound scan. Treating blood in semen The treatment your GP or urologist recommends will depend on what they think is the underlying reason for the blood in your semen. In many cases, particularly if you have no other symptoms or the blood in your semen was an isolated incident, no treatment is necessary and the problem will usually resolve on its own. If a clear reason is identified, the treatment you're offered will depend on the specific cause. For example, you may be given antibiotics to treat an infection and cysts may need to be drained with a needle. If there's a serious underlying cause, such as a blood clotting disorder or cancer, you'll be referred to an appropriate specialist for any necessary treatment.

In general, bright-red blood means the bleeding has come from somewhere near your anus and is a typical sign of piles (haemorrhoids) or a small tear (anal fissure) in the skin of your anus. Although these are common problems, don't let embarrassment stop you seeing your GP. You should always get rectal bleeding checked to rule out more serious causes. Around 10% of adults experience rectal bleeding every year in the UK. If the blood is darker in colour and sticky, the bleeding may have occurred higher up your digestive system. This type of bleeding can turn your faeces black or plum-coloured (known as melaena). Having plum-coloured, dark and sticky faeces may be a medical emergency \u2013 you should see your GP immediately or contact NHS 111. How your GP investigates rectal bleeding If your GP needs to examine you to find out what's causing your rectal bleeding, they may carry out a rectal examination. This involves putting a gloved finger inside your bottom (rectum). There's no need to feel embarrassed or nervous: it's a quick and painless procedure that GPs are used to doing. The examination usually takes one to five minutes, depending on whether your GP finds anything unusual. You may be referred to a hospital or specialist clinic if further examinations and tests are needed. Is it bowel cancer? Many people with rectal bleeding worry they may have bowel cancer. While rectal bleeding can be a sign of early-stage bowel cancer, other factors may also be present for your doctor to think you're at risk. You should be urgently referred to a specialist with suspected bowel cancer if you have rectal bleeding and: you're aged 40 or older and have passed looser or more frequent stools for the last six weeks you're aged 60 or older and the bleeding has lasted for six weeks or more your GP has found an abnormality (such as a lump) after examining you  you also have anaemia (a reduced number of red blood cells) you have a family history of bowel cancer you have ulcerative colitis Bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer, depending on where the cancer starts. Find out more about bowel cancer, and read the NICE guidelines for being referred with suspected cancer. Common causes of rectal bleeding Some of the most common causes of visible rectal bleeding in adults are outlined below. However, don't try to diagnose yourself, and always see your GP for a proper diagnosis. Click on the links for more information about these causes. piles (haemorrhoids) \u2013 swollen blood vessels in and around the rectum. They can bleed when you have a bowel movement, which can leave streaks of bright-red blood in your stools and on the toilet paper. Piles may also cause itchiness around your anus. They often heal on their own. anal fissure \u2013 a small tear in the skin of the anus, which can be painful as the skin is very sensitive. The blood is usually bright red and the bleeding soon stops. You may feel like you need to keep passing stools, even when your bowel is empty. It often heals on its own within a few weeks. anal fistula \u2013 a small channel that develops between the end of the bowel, known as the anal canal or back passage, and the skin near the anus (the opening where waste leaves the body). They're usually painful and can cause bleeding when you go to the toilet. angiodysplasia \u2013 abnormal blood vessels in the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause bleeding. It's more common in older people and can cause painless rectal bleeding. gastroenteritis \u2013 a viral or bacterial infection of the stomach and bowel, which your immune system usually fights off after a few days. It can cause diarrhoea containing traces of blood and mucus, as well as vomiting and stomach cramps. diverticula \u2013 small bulges in the lining of your lower bowel. These contain weakened blood vessels that can burst and cause sudden, painless bleeding (you may pass quite a lot of blood in your stools). bowel cancer (colon or rectal cancer) \u2013 you should always get checked by your GP if you have rectal bleeding. The only symptom of bowel cancer may be rectal bleeding in the early stages, so don't ignore it. Bowel cancer can be treated more easily if it's diagnosed at an early stage. Less common causes of rectal bleeding Some of the more unusual causes of rectal bleeding include: anticoagulant drugs \u2013 such as warfarin or aspirin, which are taken to reduce your chance of a blood clot but can sometimes cause internal bleeding. inflammatory bowel disease \u2013 such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. These long-term conditions cause the lining of the bowel to become inflamed. Crohn's disease affects the gut higher up, whereas ulcerative colitis affects the large bowel and rectum further down. Both tend to cause bloody diarrhoea. bowel polyps \u2013 small growths on the inner lining of the colon or rectum. These are common and often don't cause symptoms, but may lead to a small amount of blood in your stool. sexually transmitted infections (STIs) \u2013 any sexual activity involving the anal area can spread STIs, which may sometimes lead to rectal bleeding. Read more about the risks of anal sex.

If you notice bright red blood in your urine, or if your urine has turned red or brown because it has blood in it, see your GP. Sometimes, urine may contain only a small amount of blood invisible to the naked eye and is only apparent when a urine test is carried out for something else. This still needs to be investigated by your doctor, as healthy urine should not contain any detectable amounts of blood. The medical name for blood in the urine is haematuria. If blood in the urine is obvious with the naked eye, it is called \"macroscopic\", or \"visible haematuria\". If the blood can only be detected with laboratory testing, it is called \"microscopic\", or \"non-visible\". The blood will have come from somewhere within the urinary tract \u2013 the kidneys, bladder or the tubes that urine passes through. It is often the result of a urinary tract infection (UTI), such as cystitis. This page outlines the most common reasons for blood in the urine, to give you an idea of what may be causing the problem. However, this guide should not be used to self-diagnose your condition, and it's important to see your GP for a proper diagnosis. Is there definitely blood in your urine? Before you read on, it's worth considering whether you have recently eaten beetroot, as this can colour the urine pink and cause unnecessary alarm. Some medicines, such as the antibiotics nitrofurantoin and rifampicin, can also turn your urine red or brown. Check that the blood is actually coming from your urine and not your vagina (if you're a woman) or back passage. Common causes of blood in urine These include: a bladder infection (such as cystitis) \u2013 which typically also causes a burning pain when you urinate a kidney infection \u2013 which may also cause a high temperature and pain in the side of your tummy kidney stones \u2013 which may be painless, but can sometimes block one of the tubes coming from your kidneys and cause severe tummy pain urethritis \u2013 inflammation of the tube that carries urine out of the body (urethra); it's often caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia an enlarged prostate gland \u2013 this is a common condition in older men and nothing to do with prostate cancer; an enlarged prostate gland will press on the bladder and may also cause problems such as difficulty urinating and a frequent need to urinate bladder cancer \u2013 this usually affects adults aged over 50 and can also cause you to urinate more often and more urgently, as well as pain when urinating kidney cancer \u2013 this also usually affects adults aged over 50, and can cause persistent pain below your ribs and a lump in your tummy prostate cancer \u2013 this is usually only seen in men aged over 50 and usually progresses very slowly; other symptoms can include needing to urinate more frequently and urgently, and difficulty emptying your bladder You can read more about these conditions by clicking on the above links. Seeing your GP Your GP will ask about your symptoms and carry out a physical examination to help determine the cause of the blood in your urine. For men, this may include a rectal examination and women may have a vaginal examination. They will also arrange blood\/and or urine tests to look for signs of an infection. If they think that an infection is likely, they may prescribe some antibiotics before you get your results and will refer you to a specialist if your test results later show you don't have an infection. In some cases, your GP may recommend keeping an eye on your symptoms to see if they get better on their own over time. Referral to a specialist Your GP should refer you urgently to a specialist if any of the following apply: you have visible blood in your urine and no pain, and tests show there is no infection you are 40 or over and keep getting UTIs and blood in your urine you are 50 or over and a urine test picks up unexplained non-visible blood in your urine you have a lump in your tummy (a possible tumour) that was picked up during physical examination by your doctor or during a scan non-visible haematuria is picked up during a test, particularly if there is also protein found in the urine You will be referred to a hospital urology or nephrology department, or a specialist haematuria clinic, for further tests to identify the cause of your symptoms. These tests may include more blood and urine tests, an ultrasound scan, an X-ray and a cystoscopy. This is a procedure used to examine the inside of the bladder, using an instrument called a cystoscope.

Go to your GP surgery or your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. It can be a sign of a serious medical problem and needs to be investigated straight away. If you vomit blood it means there's bleeding somewhere in your gullet, stomach or the first part of your small intestine (duodenum). Haematemesis is the medical name for blood in the vomit. The amount and colour of blood can vary. For example: you may have vomited large amounts of bright red blood there may be streaks of blood in your vomit, mixed up with food there may be what look like coffee grounds in your vomit, which means the blood has been in your stomach for a few hours Keep a small sample of the vomit to show your GP or the doctor treating you. It will give them much better idea of what's wrong. Unless you're perfectly well and the cause is obvious to your GP or doctor (for example, swallowing blood from a nosebleed), you should be admitted to hospital straight away for tests. These will include blood tests and an endoscopy. This is where a thin, flexible tube with a light and camera at one end (an endoscope) is used to examine the inside of your digestive tract. It's important to confirm that the blood you've vomited has come from your stomach or gullet, and that you haven't coughed it up from your airways or lungs, which would indicate a completely different problem. Read about coughing up blood. Below is a summary of the most likely causes of blood in the vomit. It's a rough guide that should give you a better idea of the problem. However, don't use it to diagnose yourself \u2013 always leave that to your GP or doctor. Common causes of vomiting blood The most common causes of vomiting blood are discussed below. Stomach ulcer or severe gastritis A stomach ulcer or severe gastritis (stomach lining inflammation) are the most likely cause of vomiting blood if you also have a burning or gnawing pain in your tummy. Bleeding occurs when the ulcer or inflammation damages an underlying artery. Oesophageal varices Oesophageal varices are enlarged veins in the walls of the lower part of the oesophagus (gullet) that bleed but don't usually cause any pain. They're often caused by alcoholic liver disease. If your GP or doctor suspects that oesophageal varices are the cause of blood in your vomit, you'll need to be admitted to hospital immediately. Severe gastro-oesophageal reflux disease Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is where acid leaks out of the stomach and up into the oesophagus. If you have severe GORD it can irritate the lining of your oesophagus and cause bleeding. Tear in the oesophagus Prolonged retching can tear the lining of your oesophagus, which can also result in bleeding. Swallowed blood It's possible to swallow blood in certain circumstances \u2013 for example, after a severe nosebleed. The above conditions may also cause you to have blood in your stools (causing black, tarry poo). Less common causes of vomiting blood Less commonly, blood in your vomit may be caused by: swallowing poisons \u2013 such as corrosive acid or arsenic (read more about poisoning) a blood condition \u2013 such as thrombocytopenia (a reduced number of platelets in the blood), leukaemia, haemophilia or anaemia cancer of the oesophagus or stomach cancer \u2013 cancer may be suspected if you're over 55 and you've also lost a lot of weight (it's otherwise rare)  Haematemesis is the medical name for blood in the vomit  About A&E departments Find out when it is appropriate to go to A&E and what other services offer urgent care Page last reviewed: 06\/10\/2014 Next review due: 06\/10\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

In sepsis, the body's immune system goes into overdrive as it tries to fight an infection. This can reduce the blood supply to vital organs such as the brain, heart and kidneys. Without quick treatment, sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death. Symptoms Early symptoms of sepsis may include: a high temperature (fever) or low body temperature chills and shivering a fast heartbeat fast breathing In some cases, symptoms of more severe sepsis or septic shock (when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level) develop soon after. These can include: feeling dizzy or faint a change in mental state \u2013 such as confusion or disorientation diarrhoea  nausea and vomiting slurred speech severe muscle pain severe breathlessness less urine production than normal \u2013 for example, not urinating for a day cold, clammy and pale or mottled skin loss of consciousness When to seek medical advice See your GP immediately or call NHS 111 if you've recently had an infection or injury and you have possible early signs of sepsis. If sepsis is suspected, you'll usually be referred to hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. Severe sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies. If you think you or someone in your care has one of these conditions, call 999 and ask for an ambulance. How is sepsis diagnosed? Sepsis is often diagnosed based on simple measurements such as your temperature, heart rate and breathing rate, and may require a simple blood test. Other tests that can help determine the type of infection, where it's located and which body functions have been affected include: urine or stool samples a wound culture \u2013 where a small sample of tissue, skin or fluid is taken from the affected area for testing respiratory secretion testing \u2013 taking a sample of saliva, phlegm or mucus blood pressure tests imaging studies \u2013 such as an X-ray, ultrasound scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan How sepsis is treated If sepsis is detected early and hasn't affected vital organs yet, it may be possible to treat the infection at home with antibiotics. Most people who have sepsis detected at this stage make a full recovery. Almost all people with severe sepsis and septic shock require admission to hospital. Some people may require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Because of problems with vital organs, people with severe sepsis are likely to be very ill and the condition can be fatal. However, sepsis is treatable if it is identified and treated quickly, and in most cases leads to a full recovery with no lasting problems. Read more about treating sepsis. Recovering from sepsis The amount of time it takes to fully recover from sepsis varies, depending on factors such as: the severity of the sepsis the person's overall health how much time was spent in hospital whether treatment was needed in an ICU Some people make a full recovery quicker than others, and not everyone experiences long-term problems. However, possible problems may include physical symptoms, such as: feeling lethargic or excessively tired muscle weakness swollen limbs or joint pain chest pain or breathlessness post-sepsis syndrome Being seriously ill can also have a psychological or emotional impact, leading to problems such as: anxiety or fear depression nightmares or insomnia poor concentration or short-term memory loss Read more about recovering from sepsis on the UK Sepsis Trust website. Who's at risk? Each year it's estimated more than 100,000 people in the UK are admitted to hospital with sepsis. Around 31,000 people die every year as a result of the condition. Anyone can develop sepsis after an injury or minor infection, although some people are more vulnerable. People most at risk of sepsis include those: with a medical condition or receiving medical treatment that weakens their immune system who are already in hospital with a serious illness who are very young or very old who have just had surgery or who have wounds or injuries as a result of an accident Read more about the causes of sepsis. Sepsis, septicaemia and blood poisoning Although sepsis is often referred to as either blood poisoning or septicaemia, these terms refer to the invasion of bacteria into the bloodstream. Sepsis can affect multiple organs or the entire body, even without blood poisoning or septicaemia. Sepsis can also be caused by viral or fungal infections, although bacterial infections are by far the most common cause.

Health risks Checking your blood pressure Causes Reducing your blood pressure Medication for high blood pressure What is high blood pressure? Blood pressure is recorded with two numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body. The diastolic pressure (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels. They're both measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg). As a general guide: high blood pressure is considered to be 140\/90mmHg or higher ideal blood pressure is considered to be between 90\/60mmHg and 120\/80mmHg low blood pressure is considered to be 90\/60mmHg or lower A blood pressure reading between 120\/80mmHg and 140\/90mmHg could mean you're at risk of developing high blood pressure if you don't take steps to keep your blood pressure under control.

Naturally low blood pressure is unlikely to cause any symptoms and is normally nothing to worry about. But if your blood pressure drops too low, it can restrict the amount of blood flowing to your brain and other vital organs, which can cause unsteadiness, dizziness or fainting. See your GP if you experience any symptoms of low blood pressure and are concerned. All adults should have their blood pressure checked at least every five years. If you haven't had yours measured or don't know what your reading is, ask your GP to check it. Read more about the symptoms of low blood pressure. What is low blood pressure? The heart pumps a constant supply of blood around the body through arteries, veins and capillaries. Blood pressure is a measure of the force of the blood on the walls of the arteries as the blood flows through them. It's measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) and recorded as two measurements: systolic pressure \u2013 the pressure when your heart beats and squeezes blood into your arteries diastolic pressure \u2013 the pressure when your heart rests between beats  For example, if your systolic blood pressure is 120mmHg and your diastolic blood pressure is 80mmHg, your blood pressure is 120 over 80, which is commonly written as 120\/80. Normal blood pressure is between 90\/60 and 140\/90. If you have a reading of 140\/90 or more, you have high blood pressure (hypertension). This puts you at greater risk of developing serious health conditions, such as heart attack or stroke. People with a blood pressure reading under 90\/60 are usually regarded as having low blood pressure. Read more about diagnosing low blood pressure. Why do I have low blood pressure? You can have low blood pressure for many reasons, including the time of day, your age, the temperature, any medication you may be on, an injury, and some illnesses. Read more about the causes of low blood pressure. Treatment and self-help Naturally low blood pressure doesn't usually need to be treated unless it's causing symptoms such as dizziness or recurrent falls. If it's causing symptoms, your GP will look at what the cause might be in case it can be treated. There are also various things you can do to help limit symptoms of low blood pressure, including: standing up gradually and avoiding standing for long periods of time ensuring you are well hydrated wearing support stockings adding more salt to your diet eating smaller meals more often Read more about treating low blood pressure.

Blood pressure is the term used to describe the strength with which your blood pushes on the sides of your arteries as it's pumped around your body. High blood pressure (hypertension) can put a strain on your arteries and organs, which can increase your risk of developing serious problems such as heart attacks and strokes. Low blood pressure (hypotension) isn't usually as serious, although it can cause dizziness and fainting in some people. A blood pressure test is the only way to find out if your blood pressure is too high or too low, because most people won't have any obvious symptoms. Having a test is easy and could save your life. When should I get my blood pressure tested? You can ask for a blood pressure test if you're worried about your blood pressure at any point. You can get your blood pressure tested at a number of places, including: at your local GP surgery at some pharmacies in some workplaces at home (see home blood pressure testing below) at an NHS Health Check appointment offered to adults in England aged 40-74 It's recommended that all adults over 40 years of age have their blood pressure tested at least every five years so any potential problems can be detected early. If you've already been diagnosed with high or low blood pressure, or you're at a particularly high risk of these problems, you may need to have more frequent tests to monitor your blood pressure. How blood pressure is tested A device called a sphygmomanometer will be used to measure your blood pressure. This usually consists of a stethoscope, arm cuff, pump and dial, although automatic devices that use sensors and have a digital display are also commonly used nowadays. It's best to sit down with your back supported and legs uncrossed for the test. You'll usually need to roll up your sleeves or remove any long-sleeved clothing, so the cuff can be placed around your upper arm. Try to relax and avoid talking while the test is carried out. During the test: you hold out one of your arms so it's at the same level as your heart, and the cuff is placed around it \u2013 your arm should be supported in this position, such as with a cushion or arm of a chair the cuff is pumped up to restrict the blood flow in your arm \u2013 this squeezing may feel a bit uncomfortable, but only lasts a few seconds the pressure in the cuff is slowly released while a stethoscope is used to listen to your pulse (digital devices use sensors to detect vibrations in your arteries) the pressure in the cuff is recorded at two points as the blood flow starts to return to your arm \u2013 these measurements are used to give your blood pressure reading (see below) You can usually find out your result straight away, either from the healthcare professional carrying out the test or on the digital display. Home blood pressure monitoring Blood pressure tests can also be carried out at home using your own digital blood pressure monitor. This can give a better reflection of your blood pressure, as being tested in somewhere like a GP surgery can make you feel anxious and can affect the result. It can also allow you to monitor your condition more easily in the long term. You can buy a variety of low-cost monitors so you can test your blood pressure at home or while you're out and about. It's important to make sure you use equipment that has been properly tested. The British Hypertension Society (BHS) has information about validated blood pressure monitors that are available to buy. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring In some cases, your doctor may recommend 24-hour or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). This is where your blood pressure is tested automatically around every 30 minutes over a 24-hour period using a cuff attached to a portable device worn on your waist. ABPM can help to give a clear picture of how your blood pressure changes over the course of a day. You should continue with your normal daily activities during the test, although you must avoid getting the equipment wet. Understanding your blood pressure reading Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) and is given as two figures: systolic pressure \u2013 the pressure when your heart pushes blood out diastolic pressure \u2013 the pressure when your heart rests between beats For example, if your blood pressure is \"140 over 90\" or 140\/90mmHg, it means you have a systolic pressure of 140mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 90mmHg. As a general guide: normal blood pressure is considered to be between 90\/60mmHg and 120\/80mmHg high blood pressure is considered to be 140\/90mmHg or higher low blood pressure is considered to be 90\/60mmHg or lower A blood pressure reading between 120\/80mmHg and 140\/90mmHg could mean you're at risk of developing high blood pressure if you don't take steps to keep your blood pressure under control. Find out more about what your blood pressure result means. Controlling your blood pressure If your blood pressure is found to be too high or too low, your GP or the healthcare professional performing the test can advise you about ways to control it. This may involve: adopting a healthy, balanced diet and restricting your salt intake getting regular exercise cutting down on alcohol losing weight stopping smoking taking medication, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium channel blockers In some cases, you may be referred to a doctor such as a cardiologist (heart specialist) to discuss treatment options.

Newborn blood spot screening involves taking a blood sample to find out if your baby has one of nine rare but serious health conditions. Most babies screened won't have any of these conditions but, for the few who do, the benefits of screening are enormous. Early treatment can improve their health and prevent severe disability, and even death. What does the blood spot test involve? When your baby is five days old, a health professional will prick their heel using a special device and collect four drops of blood on a special card. You can minimise any distress to your baby by cuddling and feeding them, and making sure they are warm and comfortable. Occasionally, the sample may need to be taken when your baby is six, seven or eight days old. Sometimes a second blood spot sample is needed. The reason for this will be explained to you. It doesn't necessarily mean there is something wrong with your baby. The test doesn't carry any known risks for your baby. Which conditions is the blood spot test for? The blood spot test screens for the following nine rare but serious conditions. If you, your partner, or a family member already has one of these conditions (or a family history of it), please tell your health professional straight away. Sickle cell disease About 1 in 2,000 babies born in the UK has sickle cell disease. This is a serious inherited blood disease. Sickle cell disease affects haemoglobin, the iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body. Babies who have this condition will need specialist care throughout their lives. People with sickle cell disease can have attacks of severe pain and get serious, life-threatening infections. They are usually anaemic because their blood cells have difficulty carrying oxygen. The blood spot screening test means that babies with sickle cell disease can receive early treatment to help them live healthier lives. This may include vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent serious illnesses. Pregnant women are also routinely tested for sickle cell disease early in pregnancy. Read more about sickle cell disease, or download leaflets for parents whose child has sickle cell disease. Cystic fibrosis About 1 in 2,500 babies born in the UK has cystic fibrosis. This inherited condition affects the digestion and lungs. Babies with cystic fibrosis may not gain weight well and frequently have chest infections. Babies with the condition can be treated early with a high-energy diet, medicines, and physiotherapy. Although children with cystic fibrosis may still become very ill, early treatment can help them live longer, healthier lives. Read more about cystic fibrosis, or download a leaflet for parents whose baby has suspected cystic fibrosis. Congenital hypothyroidism About 1 in 3,000 babies born in the UK has congenital hypothyroidism. Babies with congenital hypothyroidism do not have enough of the hormone thyroxine. Without thyroxine, babies do not grow properly and can develop learning disabilities. Babies who have the condition can be treated early with thyroxine tablets, and this allows them to develop normally. See more information about congenital hypothyroidism (CHT). Inherited metabolic diseases It is important to let your health professional know if you have a family history of a metabolic disease (a disease that affects your metabolism). Babies are screened for six inherited metabolic diseases. These are: phenylketonuria (PKU) medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)  isovaleric acidaemia (IVA)  glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1)  homocystinuria (pyridoxine unresponsive) (HCU)  About 1 in 10,000 babies born in the UK has PKU or MCADD. The other conditions are rarer, occurring in 1 in 100,000 to 150,000 babies. Without treatment, babies with inherited metabolic diseases can become suddenly and seriously ill. The diseases all have different symptoms. Depending on which one affects your baby, the condition may be life threatening or cause severe developmental problems. They can all be treated with a carefully managed diet and, in some cases, medicines as well. What are amino acids? Our bodies break down protein foods like meat and fish into amino acids (the building blocks of protein). Any amino acids that aren't needed are usually broken down and removed from the body. Babies with the inherited metabolic diseases that are screened for are unable to break down one or more amino acids. When levels of these amino acids get very high, they are harmful. Does my baby have to have the blood spot test? It's not compulsory, but it's recommended because it could save your baby's life.  You can choose to have screening for sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis or congenital hypothyroidism individually but you can only choose to have screening for all six inherited metabolic diseases or none at all. If you don't want your baby to be screened for any of these conditions, discuss it with your midwife. You should be given information about the blood spot test and the diseases it screens for in advance so you can make an informed decision for your baby. If you change your mind, babies can be screened up to the age of 12 months for all the conditions except cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis can only be screened for up to eight weeks of age. If you have any concerns about the tests, speak to your midwife, health visitor, or GP. When will we get the results? You should receive the results either by letter or from a health professional by the time your baby is six to eight weeks old. The results should be recorded in your baby's personal child health record (red book). It's important to keep this safe and take it with you to all your baby's appointments. If you have not received your baby's results, speak to your health visitor or GP. You will be contacted sooner if your baby screens positive. This means they're more likely to have one of the conditions tested for. If your baby is thought to have congenital hypothyroidism (CHT) or an inherited metabolic disease, you will be contacted the day the result is available, or the next working day, and given an appointment to see a specialist. If your baby is thought to have cystic fibrosis, you will be contacted before they are four weeks old. If your baby is thought to have sickle cell disease, you will be contacted before they are six weeks old. Screening for cystic fibrosis finds some babies who may be genetic carriers of the condition. These babies may need further testing. Screening for sickle cell disease also finds babies who are carriers of this or other red blood cell diseases. Carriers are healthy, although they can experience problems in situations where their bodies aren't getting much oxygen \u2013 for example, if they are having an anaesthetic. Parents of babies who are found to be carriers should be told by the time they are six to eight weeks old. Read more about what being a carrier means. What do the results mean? Most babies will have a normal result, which means it's unlikely that they have any of the conditions. A small number of babies will screen positive for one of the conditions. This doesn't mean they have the condition, but they are more likely to have it. They will be referred to a specialist for further tests. It's important to know that screening is not 100% certain. A baby with a negative screening result may later turn out to have the disease screened for. This is known as a false negative. Babies with a positive result sometimes turn out not to have the disease \u2013 what's known as a false positive. Occasionally, other medical conditions are picked up by blood spot test screening. For example, babies with beta thalassaemia major (a serious blood disease) will usually be detected. These babies will also need to be referred for early treatment. If your baby's blood spot test is positive The NHS screening programme has produced leaflets for parents who have been told their baby may have one of the conditions screened for. The leaflets provide information about the condition, further tests your baby may be offered, and what treatment is needed. They also answer parents' questions, including where to find support. See FAQs on blood spot screening. Find out what happens to your baby's blood spot card. The Screening Tests for You and Your Baby leaflet contains information about the blood spot screening test and the conditions it screens for. It is available in other languages.

For example, a blood test can be used to: assess your general state of health check if you have an infection see how well certain organs, such as the liver and kidneys, are working screen for certain genetic conditions Most blood tests only take a few minutes to complete and are carried out at your GP surgery or local hospital by a doctor, nurse or phlebotomist (a specialist in taking blood samples). Read about some common types of blood test. For more information about a wider range of tests, search the blood test A-Z index on Lab Tests Online UK. Preparing for a blood test The healthcare professional who arranges your blood test will tell you whether there are any specific instructions you need to follow before your test. For example, depending on the type of blood test, you may be asked to: avoid eating or drinking anything, apart from water (fasting) for up to 12 hours \u2013 see can I eat and drink before having a blood test? stop taking a certain medication \u2013 see can I take medication before having a blood test? It's important to follow the instructions you're given, as it may affect the result of the test and mean it needs to be delayed or carried out again. What happens during a blood test? A blood test usually involves taking a blood sample from a blood vessel in your arm. The arm is a convenient part of the body to use because it can be easily uncovered. The usual place for a sample to be taken from is the inside of the elbow or wrist, where the veins are relatively close to the surface. Blood samples from children are often taken from the back of the hand. Their skin may be numbed with a special spray or cream before the sample is taken. A tight band (tourniquet) is usually put around your upper arm. This squeezes the arm, temporarily slowing down the flow of blood and causing the vein to swell. This makes it easier for a sample to be taken. Before taking the sample, the doctor or nurse may clean the area of skin with an antiseptic wipe. A needle attached to a syringe or special container is inserted into the vein. The syringe is used to draw out a sample of your blood. You may feel a slight pricking or scratching sensation as the needle goes in, but it shouldn't be painful. If you don't like needles and blood, tell the person who is taking the sample so they can make you more comfortable. When the sample has been taken, the needle will be removed. Pressure is applied to the skin for a few minutes using a cotton-wool pad. A plaster may be put on the small wound to keep it clean. After the test Only a small amount of blood is taken during the test so you shouldn't feel any significant after-effects. However, some people feel dizzy and faint during and after the test. If this has happened to you in the past, tell the person carrying out the test so they\u2019re aware and can help you feel more comfortable. After the test, you may have a small bruise where the needle went in. Bruises can be painful, but are usually harmless and fade over the next few days. Blood test results After the blood sample has been taken, it will be put into a bottle and labelled with your name and details. It will then be sent to a laboratory where it will be examined under a microscope or tested with chemicals, depending on what's being checked. The results are sent back to the hospital or to your GP. Some test results will be ready the same day or a few days later, although others may not be available for a few weeks. You'll be told when your results will be ready and how you'll be given them. Sometimes, receiving results can be stressful and upsetting. If you're worried about the outcome of a test, you may choose to take a trusted friend or relative with you. For some tests, such as HIV, you will be offered specialist counselling to help you deal with your results.

Blood-transfusion How is it performed? Blood-transfusion Risks Introduction  A blood transfusion involves taking blood from one person (the donor) and giving it to someone else. You may need a blood transfusion for a number of reasons, including: to replace blood lost during major surgery, childbirth or a severe accident to treat anaemia that has failed to respond to other treatments; anaemia is a condition where a person has low levels of red blood cells to treat inherited blood disorders, such as thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia You can refuse a blood transfusion, but you need to fully understand the consequences of this before doing so. Some medical treatments or operations can't be safely carried out without a blood transfusion being given. Read more about why a blood transfusion might be necessary. The procedure Blood is usually given through a plastic tube inserted into a vein in your arm. Each unit can take between 30 minutes and four hours. Depending on how much blood is needed, the whole procedure can take a significant length of time. Read more about how a blood transfusion is performed. How quickly is blood given? A unit (bag) of red blood cells usually takes two to three hours to give. If needed, a unit can be given more rapidly \u2013 for example, to treat severe bleeding. A unit of platelets or plasma is given in 30 to 60 minutes. Safety Blood donors are unpaid volunteers. They're carefully selected and tested to make sure the blood they donate is as safe as possible. In the UK and other Western countries, there are strict regulations regarding blood donations and blood transfusions. The aim is to reduce the risk of a person being given blood contaminated with a virus, such as hepatitis C, or receiving blood from a blood group that's unsuitable for them. Before making a blood donation, the potential donor is asked about their health, lifestyle and history. Read more information about who can donate blood. After blood has been donated, it's always tested for the following infections: hepatitis B hepatitis C HIV and AIDS syphilis human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) \u2013 a rare but potentially serious virus, which in some people can cause a type of leukaemia that's usually fatal Compared to other everyday risks, the chances of getting an infection from a blood transfusion is very low. You must be correctly identified to make sure you get the right blood transfusion. Wearing an identification band with your correct details is essential. You will be asked to state your full name and date of birth, and the details on your identification band will be checked before each bag of blood is given. You will be monitored closely during your transfusion. Read more about the risks associated with blood transfusion. What does blood do? When a donor has given blood, special equipment is used to separate the donation into different blood components, including: red blood cells \u2013 these transport oxygen around the body and are used to treat anaemia platelets \u2013 these help to stop the bleeding when a person is cut or injured; platelet transfusions can be used to prevent excessive bleeding in certain groups of people with low platelet counts, such as those having chemotherapy treatment (powerful medication to treat cancers) plasma \u2013 a liquid that makes up most of the volume of blood; plasma contains many nutrients needed by the body\u2019s cells, as well as proteins that help the blood to clot if a patient is bleeding white blood cells \u2013 these are used to fight infection Page last reviewed: 07\/01\/2015 Next review due: 07\/01\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It can be a sign of a serious problem, so it's important to seek medical advice. When blood becomes depleted of oxygen, it changes from bright red to darker in colour, and it's this that makes the skin and lips look blue. In darker-skinned people, the blue tinge may be easier to spot in the lips, gums and around the eyes. The medical name for this blue tinge is cyanosis. What to do Call 999 or go to your nearest hospital emergency department (A&E) immediately if you notice an adult or child suddenly turning blue, particularly if they have other symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or chest pain. This could be a sign of a life-threatening problem. See your GP or call NHS 111 if you have cyanosis that comes on very gradually, or affects just the fingers, hands, toes or feet. This is usually the result of a less serious problem with blood circulation, but it should still be checked by a doctor. Common causes of cyanosis Some of the main causes of cyanosis are described below, but you shouldn't use this to diagnose yourself \u2013 always leave that to a doctor. Cyanosis that just affects the hands, feet or limbs If just the fingers, toes or limbs have turned blue and feel cold, it's known as \"peripheral cyanosis\". The cause is usually poor circulation resulting from: Raynaud's phenomenon \u2013 where the blood supply to certain parts of the body, usually the fingers and toes, becomes temporarily reduced when exposed to cold temperatures peripheral arterial disease (PAD) \u2013 where a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries restricts blood supply to the legs beta-blockers \u2013 medication commonly used to treat high blood pressure a blood clot blocking the blood supply to or from a limb Cyanosis that affects the skin generally and\/or lips When all the skin and\/or lips have a blue tinge, it's known as \"central cyanosis\" and is usually a sign of low levels of oxygen in the blood. Common causes for central cyanosis are listed below. A problem with the lungs: worsening of a long-term lung condition, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lung infections, such as pneumonia, bronchiolitis or whooping cough bronchiectasis \u2013 where the airways in the lungs become abnormally widened a pulmonary embolism \u2013 a blood clot in the arteries of the lungs neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) \u2013 where the lungs can't provide enough oxygen for the rest of the body drowning or nearly drowning A problem with the airways: choking \u2013 read what to do if someone is choking croup \u2013 a childhood condition, usually caused by a virus, that affects the airways and causes a barking cough epiglottitis \u2013 inflammation and swelling of the flap of tissue at the back of the throat, usually caused by infection anaphylaxis \u2013 a severe allergic reaction that can restrict the airways A problem with the heart: heart failure \u2013 where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body congenital heart disease \u2013 a heart defect present at birth that can affect how blood travels around the heart and body cardiac arrest \u2013 where the heart stops beating Other causes: exposure to cold air or water being at high altitude seizures (fits) that last a long time a problem with the blood, such as abnormal haemoglobin (which means the blood cannot take up enough oxygen) or polycythaemia (a high concentration of red blood cells) Page last reviewed: 29\/05\/2015 Next review due: 29\/05\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Other areas of the body \u2013 such as the neck, ears and upper chest \u2013 can also be affected. As well as causing redness, blushing can sometimes make the affected area feel hot. What causes blushing? \"Normal\" blushing occurs when a strong emotional trigger stimulates the nervous system, resulting in the widening of the blood vessels in the face. This increases the flow of blood into the blood vessels just underneath the skin, causing your face to turn red. Abnormal (severe or frequent) blushing can have both psychological and physical causes, including: social anxiety disorder (social phobia) \u2013 a persistent and excessive fear of social situations generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) \u2013 a long-term condition that causes anxiety about a wide range of situations and issues rosacea \u2013 a common skin condition that mainly affects the face the menopause \u2013 where a woman stops having monthly periods, usually between 45 and 55 years of age certain medications \u2013 such as the breast cancer medication tamoxifen Blushing can also be triggered by drinking alcohol or hot drinks, eating hot or spicy food, strenuous exercise and sudden changes in temperature. Read more about the causes of blushing. When to seek medical advice Most people blush from time to time, and it isn't usually a cause for concern. But frequent and severe blushing can have a significant psychological impact, leading people to avoid certain situations and interacting with other people. You should consider speaking to your GP if you blush frequently and it's affecting your quality of life. Available treatments  If abnormal blushing is affecting your quality of life, you may benefit from treatment. The specific treatment offered will depend on the underlying cause of your blushing. If the underlying cause is thought to be psychological, such as an irrational fear (phobia) or anxiety disorder, a talking treatment called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can often be effective. Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can also help relieve any associated feelings of anxiety and worry. If the underlying cause is physical, such as the menopause or rosacea, you may be advised to avoid common triggers such as stress, alcohol and spicy foods. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can also help women with menopausal hot flushes. A surgical procedure called endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) may be considered if your blushing is particularly severe and other treatments haven't been effective. But this type of surgery carries a risk of long-term problems such as excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis).  Read more about treatments for blushing.

Obese The best way to lose weight is through a combination of diet and exercise and in some cases medication. Contact your GP for help and advice. Ethnicity and diabetes risk Black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups (BMEs) have a higher risk of developing some chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes.

You can have a healthy BMI and still have excess tummy fat \u2013 meaning you're still at risk of developing these diseases. To measure your waist: find the bottom of your ribs and the top of your hips wrap a tape measure around your waist midway between these points breathe out naturally before taking the measurement Regardless of your height or BMI, you should try to lose weight if your waist is: 94cm (37ins) or more (men) 80cm (31.5ins) or more (women) You are at very high risk and you should contact your GP if your waist is: 102cm (40ins) or more (men) 88cm (34ins) or more (women) Children's BMI For children and young people aged two to 18, the BMI calculator takes into account age and gender as well as height and weight. Obese children are thought to be at increased risk of a variety of health conditions, and they're also more likely to be overweight or obese as adults. The BMI calculator works out if a child or young person is: underweight: on the 2nd centile or below. If you're concerned about your child's weight, see your GP.

For example, a girl on the 75th centile is heavier than 75 out of 100 other girls her age. Measuring waist size is not routinely advised for children because it doesn't take their height into account. If you're concerned about your child's weight, contact your GP who may be able to refer you to your local healthy lifestyle programme for children, young people and families. Limitations of the BMI Your BMI can tell you if you're carrying too much weight but it can't tell if you're carrying too much fat. The BMI can't tell the difference between excess fat, muscle, or bone. The adult BMI does not take into account age, gender or muscle mass. This means that:  very muscular adults and athletes may be classed \"overweight\" or \"obese\" even though their body fat is low    adults who lose muscle as they get older may fall in the \"healthy weight\" range even though they may be carrying excess fat However, the BMI is a relatively straightforward and convenient method of assessing someone's weight.  Your can use your BMI result as a starting point for further discussion with your GP about your weight and your general health. Find out more in How your GP can help and check out the Change4Life website for practical tips on staying healthy as a family.

For example, they may be convinced that a barely visible scar is a major flaw that everyone is staring at, or that their nose looks abnormal. Having BDD does not mean the person is vain or self-obsessed. When does low confidence turn into BDD? Almost everyone feels unhappy about the way they look at some point in their life, but these thoughts usually come and go, and can be forgotten. However, for someone with BDD, the thoughts are very distressing, do not go away and have a significant impact on daily life. The person believes they are ugly or defective and that other people perceive them in this way, despite reassurances from others about their appearance. Who is affected It's estimated that up to one in every 100 people in the UK may have BDD, although this may be an underestimate as people with the condition often hide it from others. BDD has been found to affect similar numbers of males and females. The condition can affect all age groups, but usually starts when a person is a teenager or a young adult, when people are generally most sensitive about their appearance. It's more common in people with a history of depression or social phobia. It often occurs alongside obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or generalised anxiety disorder, and may also exist alongside an eating disorder, such as anorexia or bulimia. Typical behaviours of someone with BDD BDD can seriously affect daily life, often affecting work, social life and relationships. A person with BDD may: constantly compare their looks to other people's spend a long time in front of a mirror, but at other times avoid mirrors altogether spend a long time concealing what they believe is a defect become distressed by a particular area of their body (most commonly their face) feel anxious when around other people and avoid social situations be very secretive and reluctant to seek help, because they believe others will see them as vain or self-obsessed seek medical treatment for the perceived defect \u2013 for example, they may have cosmetic surgery, which is unlikely to relieve their distress excessively diet and exercise Although BDD is not the same as OCD, there are some similarities. For instance, the person may have to repeat certain acts, such as combing their hair, applying make-up, or picking their skin to make it \"smooth\". BDD can also lead to depression, self-harm and even thoughts of suicide. What causes BDD? The cause of BDD is not clear. It may be genetic or caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. Past life experiences may play a role too \u2013 for example, BDD may be more common in people who were teased, bullied or abused when they were children. Getting help People with BDD are often reluctant to seek help because they feel ashamed or embarrassed. However, if you have BDD, there is nothing to feel ashamed or embarrassed about. It is a long-term health condition, just like many physical conditions, and it's not your fault. Seeking help is important because it's unlikely that your symptoms will improve if left untreated, and they may get worse. You should visit your GP if you think you may have BDD. Initially, they will probably ask a number of questions about your symptoms and how they affect you, such as: Do you worry a lot about the way you look and wish you could think about it less? What specific concerns do you have about your appearance? On a typical day, how many hours is your appearance on your mind? What effect does it have on your life? Does it make it hard to do your work or be with friends? If your GP suspects BDD, they can refer you to a mental health specialist for further assessment and any appropriate treatment. Treating BDD With treatment, many people with BDD will experience an improvement in their symptoms. The specific treatments recommended for you will depend on how severely BDD affects your daily life. If you have relatively mild BDD, you will usually be referred for a talking treatment called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). More severe cases may be treated with a type of medication called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and\/or more intensive CBT. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) CBT is a type of therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave. You'll work with the therapist to agree on some goals \u2013 for example, one aim may be to stop obsessively checking your appearance. An important element of CBT for treating BDD is known as graded exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves facing situations where you would normally think obsessively about your appearance, so you are able to gradually cope better with these situations over time. As part of your therapy, you may also be given some self-help materials to use at home and you may be invited to participate in some group work. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) SSRIs are a type of antidepressant that increase the levels of a chemical called serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a chemical that the brain uses to transmit information from one brain cell to another. A number of different SSRIs are available, but most people with BDD will be prescribed a course of fluoxetine. Your medication should be taken daily and it may take 12 weeks before it has an effect. If it's effective, this treatment should continue for at least 12 months, to allow for further improvements and prevent a relapse. When the treatment is complete and your symptoms are under control, the SSRI dose should be reduced gradually to minimise the possibility of withdrawal symptoms. Common side effects of SSRIs include headaches, feeling agitated or shaky, and feeling sick. However, these will often pass within a few weeks. Adults younger than 30 will need to be carefully monitored when taking SSRIs, because of the potential increased risk of suicidal thoughts and self-harm associated with the early stages of treatment. Further treatment If SSRIs aren't effective in improving your symptoms, you may be prescribed a different type of antidepressant called clomipramine. In some cases of BDD that are particularly difficult to treat, you may be referred to The National OCD\/BDD service in London. This service offers assessment and treatment to people with BDD who have not responded to treatments that are available from their local and regional specialist services. People with BDD often have a distorted view of how they look  Support groups Some people may find it helpful to contact or join a support group for information, advice and practical tips on how to cope with BDD in daily life. To find out if there are any groups in your area, ask your doctor or check the directory of local BDD support groups on the BDD Foundation website.

Anyone who has reached puberty can produce body odour, as this is when the apocrine sweat glands develop, which produce the sweat that bacteria can quickly break down. Men are more likely to have body odour, because they tend to sweat more than women. Things that can make body odour worse include: being overweight consuming rich or spicy food and drink \u2013 such as garlic, spices and alcohol some types of medication \u2013 such as antidepressants certain medical conditions \u2013 a fruity smell can sometimes be a sign of diabetes, while a bleach-like smell may indicate liver or kidney disease Excessive sweating Hyperhidrosis is a condition where a person sweats excessively and much more than the body needs to regulate temperature. If you have hyperhidrosis, you may also have smelly feet (bromodosis). Smelly feet are caused by wearing shoes and socks that prevent sweat evaporating or being absorbed, which attracts bacteria. When to see your GP See your GP if: your sweating or body odour is causing you distress you notice a change in your body odour you suddenly begin to sweat much more than usual Managing body odour Excessive sweating and body odour is an unpleasant problem that can affect a person's confidence and self-esteem. A body odour problem can usually be managed by getting rid of excess skin bacteria \u2013 which are responsible for the smell \u2013 and keeping the skin in the affected area (usually the armpits) clean and dry. The various treatments for body odour are outlined below. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons of treatments for body odour, which allows you to compare your treatment options. Self-care advice Your armpits contain a large number of apocrine glands, which are responsible for producing body odour. Keeping your armpits clean and free of bacteria will help keep odour under control. Following the below advice can help you achieve this: take a warm bath or shower every day \u2013 to kill the bacteria on your skin; on hot days, you may need to have a bath or shower twice a day wash your armpits thoroughly \u2013 using an antibacterial soap use a deodorant or an antiperspirant \u2013 after bathing or showering regularly shave your armpits \u2013 this allows sweat to evaporate quicker, giving bacteria less time to break it down wear natural fibres, such as wool, silk or cotton \u2013 they allow your skin to breathe, which means your sweat will evaporate quicker wear clean clothes \u2013 make sure you wash your clothes regularly  limit the amount of spicy foods you eat \u2013 such as curry or garlic, because they can make your sweat smell; evidence also suggests that eating a lot of red meat tends to make body odour worse Deodorant and antiperspirant The active ingredients used in antiperspirants and deodorants differ, so you may find some more effective than others. Deodorants work by using perfume to mask the smell of sweat. Antiperspirants contain aluminium chloride (see below), which reduces the amount of sweat produced by your body. Use roll-on antiperspirants if you sweat heavily, as they tend to be more effective. Aluminium chloride Aluminium chloride is the active ingredient in most antiperspirants. It helps prevent the production of sweat. If the above self-care advice doesn't improve your body odour, you may need a stronger antiperspirant that contains more aluminium chloride. Your GP or pharmacist can recommend a suitable product and advise about how often you should use it.  Aluminium chloride solutions are usually applied every night before bed, and washed off in the morning. This is because you stop sweating in your sleep, so the solution can seep into your sweat glands and block them. This reduces how much you sweat the next day. As the aluminium chloride solution begins to take effect, you can use it less often (every other night, or once or twice a week). Surgery Surgery may be recommended for severe body odour that can't be treated by self-care measures and over-the-counter products. One type of surgery involves removing a small area of skin from your armpit and the tissue just below it. This gets rid of the most troublesome sweat glands. It may also be possible for the sweat glands to be drawn out from the deeper skin layers using liposuction \u2013 a technique that's often used to remove unwanted body fat. Another option is a type of surgery called endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS), which uses keyhole surgery to destroy the nerves that control sweating. During ETS, the surgeon makes two or three small incisions under each arm. A tiny camera (endoscope) is inserted through one of the incisions so the surgeon can see the inside of your armpit on a monitor. The surgeon will insert small surgical tools through the other incisions, allowing them to cut the nerves. Alternatively, a thin electrode that emits an electrical current will be used to destroy the nerves. Risks associated with ETS include damage to nearby arteries or nerves, and compensatory sweating (increased sweating from other areas of the body). You should fully discuss the risks of the procedure with your surgeon beforehand.  Botulinum toxin Botulinum toxin, often referred to as Botox, is another possible treatment for people with excessive underarm sweating. Botulinum toxin is a powerful poison that can be used safely in minute doses. Between 12 and 20 injections of botulinum toxin are made in the affected area of the body, such as the armpits, hands, feet or face. The toxin works by blocking signals from your brain to the sweat glands, reducing the amount of sweat produced. The procedure takes 30-45 minutes, and the effects of botulinum toxin usually last for between two and eight months. After this time, further treatment will be needed. The availability of treatment with botulinum toxin on the NHS can vary widely, and it may not be available in your area.  You may need to visit a private cosmetic clinic for treatment. Prices can vary, depending on the area of the body being treated (treating both armpits can cost up to £500). Make sure you find out the cost before starting treatment.

But teenagers and pregnant women are especially prone because hormonal changes make them sweat more. You're also more likely to have foot perspiration if you're on your feet all day, if you're under a lot of stress or if you have a medical condition called hyperhidrosis, which makes you sweat more than usual. Fungal infections, such as athlete's foot, can also lead to bad foot odour. According to podiatrist, Lorraine Jones, feet become smelly if sweat soaks into shoes and they don't dry before you wear them again. Bacteria on the skin break down sweat as it comes from the pores. A cheesy odour is released as the sweat decomposes. \"Your feet sweat into your shoes all day so they get damp and bacteria start to grow. The bacteria continue to breed once you've taken your shoes off, especially if you put them in a dark cupboard. Then, when you put your shoes back on the next day, even if you've just had a shower, putting your feet into still damp shoes creates the perfect conditions for the bacteria to thrive \u2013 warm, dark and moist.\" How to treat smelly feet The good news is that there's a simple, quick, sure-fire solution to smelly feet. Wash your feet with an anti-bacterial soap called Hibiscrub. There are lots of over-the-counter foot hygiene products at your local chemist, but Hibiscrub is the best one. Leave on the Hibiscrub for a couple of minutes, then wash it off. According to Lorraine, \"if you do this twice a day, you'll definitely banish smelly feet within a week.\" She adds that you shouldn't use Hibiscrub on your feet if you have broken skin, such as eczema. Preventing smelly feet Keeping feet fresh and sweet smelling is all down to good personal hygiene and changing your shoes regularly. To keep feet fresh: Never wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row. Instead, wear different shoes on successive days so they have at least 24 hours to dry out. Make sure teenage boys have two pairs of trainers so that they don't have to wear the same pair for two or more consecutive days. Wash and dry your feet every day and change your socks (ideally wool or cotton, not nylon) at least once a day. Keep your toenails short and clean and remove any hard skin with a foot file. Hard skin can become soggy when damp, which provides an ideal home for bacteria If you're particularly susceptible to sweaty feet, it's a good idea to: dab between your toes with cotton wool dipped in surgical spirit after a shower or bath \u2013 surgical spirit helps dry out the skin between the toes really well \u2013 in addition to drying them with a towel use a spray deodorant or antiperspirant on your feet \u2013 a normal underarm deodorant or antiperspirant works just as well as a specialist foot product and will cost you less put medicated insoles, which have a deodorising effect, in your shoes try feet-fresh socks \u2013 some sports socks have ventilation panels to keep feet dry, and antibacterial socks are impregnated with chemicals to discourage the odour-producing bacteria that feed on sweat wear leather or canvas shoes, as they let your feet breathe, unlike plastic ones wear open-toed sandals in summer and go barefoot at home in the evenings When to see a doctor Smelly feet are a harmless problem that generally clears up. Sometimes, however, it can be a sign of a medical condition. See your GP if simple measures to reduce your foot odour don't help, or if you're worried that your level of sweating is abnormally high. Your doctor can offer you a strong prescription antiperspirant or refer you for a treatment called iontophoresis, which delivers a mild electric current through water to your feet to combat excessive sweating. Here are more tips on how to look after your feet. Top tip for prevention 'Never wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row. Instead, wear different shoes on successive days so they have a minimum of 24 hours to dry out'  Lorraine Jones, chiropodist     Page last reviewed: 11\/12\/2015 Next review due: 11\/12\/2017 More articles on: Foot health Share: Save: Subscribe:  Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Body piercing is especially popular with teenagers and young people. It\u2019s a fairly safe procedure, as long as it\u2019s performed by a licensed specialist, and care is taken by the piercer and yourself to avoid infection. Finding an approved piercer Most local councils keep registers of approved piercers who have passed hygiene and safety standards, and who are regularly inspected by health and safety officers. Contact your local council for further information. Don\u2019t try to carry out body piercing yourself. This can be very dangerous, as there\u2019s a high risk of infection or scarring. If you've already found a body piercing shop, take a look around before you go ahead with the piercing. Check for any potential health risks. You should be able to answer \"yes\" to all the questions on our safety checklist. Possible risks Bacterial infection is the main risk associated with body piercing. A build-up of pus (abscess) sometimes forms around the piercing site, which can be serious if left untreated. All professional body piercers in the UK use sterile instruments, so it's very rare to catch conditions such as hepatitis and HIV\/AIDS from body piercing. Read more about the risks of body piercing. How body piercing is carried out The skin may be cleaned with soap and water, and blotted dry before it\u2019s marked up and checked by both you and the piercer. The piercing will then be done with sterile piercing equipment. Generally, only earlobe piercings are carried out with a piercing gun, by either a jeweller or a professional body piercer, although some guns may be used on ear cartilage. Guns should not be used on any part of the body besides the ears. All other types of piercing should be carried out using a hollow needle, which is pushed through the skin and tissue of the body part. You'll normally feel a quick, sharp sting while the skin is being pierced. After a piercing, the area may bleed slightly and it may be tender, itchy and bruised for a few weeks. Read more about how piercings are carried out. Avoiding infection Follow the specialist's advice after you've had your piercing. This will usually involve keeping the area clean and dry, as well as looking for signs of infection. Don\u2019t touch or fiddle with the area and don\u2019t turn the piercing. If a crust develops over the piercing, don\u2019t remove it \u2013 these form naturally and are the body's way of protecting the pierced site. You may be advised to use a salt water solution or other wound wash to clean the area and dry it out. Strong surgical spirits and cream-based products should be avoided, because they can irritate the skin and trap bacteria. Read more about caring for a body piercing. Age restrictions There is no legal age restriction on most body piercings, but performing genital or female nipple piercing on someone under the age of 18 could be considered an offence. Some local authorities and piercing businesses may have their own regulations concerning age limits and consent for body piercings. You will usually need to sign a consent form to confirm that you wish to go ahead with the piercing. Children under the age of 16 may need to have a parent or guardian with them.

Boils Boils (furuncles) can develop anywhere on your skin, but they're most likely to occur at the site of an infected hair follicle (a hole a hair grows out of). Boils most commonly develop on areas of skin where there's a combination of hair, sweat and friction, such as the neck, face or thighs. Over time, pus forms inside the boil, causing it to grow larger and become more painful. In most cases, a boil will eventually burst and the pus will drain away without leaving a scar. This can take from two days to three weeks to happen. Boils are more common in teenagers and young adults, especially in males. Young males living in overcrowded and possibly unhygienic conditions are particularly at risk. Carbuncles A carbuncle is a dome-shaped collection of boils that usually develops over the space of a few days. They most often occur on the back, thighs, or the back of the neck. A fully grown carbuncle can be more than 10cm (4 inches) in size, and will leak pus from a number of points. You may also have other symptoms, such as: a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above a general feeling of being unwell feeling weak and exhausted Carbuncles are less common than boils and tend to occur mostly in middle-aged or older men in poor health or with a weakened immune system. When to see your GP Most boils burst and heal by themselves without the need for medical treatment. However, visit your GP for advice if you have a boil: on your face, nose or spine \u2013 this can sometimes cause serious complications that gets bigger and feels soft and spongy to touch \u2013 it may not burst and heal by itself that doesn't heal within two weeks You should also see your GP if you develop a carbuncle, or if you have additional symptoms such as a high temperature or feeling generally unwell. You GP should be able to identify a boil or carbuncle by looking at it. Causes of boils and carbuncles Boils and carbuncles are often caused by a type of bacteria known as Staphylococcus aureus (staph bacteria) infecting one or more hair follicles. Staph bacteria usually live harmlessly on the surface of the skin or in the lining of the nose. Boils tend to occur when the bacteria enters the skin through cuts and grazes. This causes your immune system to respond by sending infection-fighting white blood cells to kill the bacteria. Over time, a mix of dead bacteria, dead white blood cells and dead skin cells builds up inside the boil to form pus. A carbuncle develops when the infection spreads further beneath the skin to create a cluster of boils. Can I catch a boil or carbuncle? Yes, you can. Unlike acne, both boils and carbuncles can spread to another part of the body or to another person. Taking simple precautions, such as carefully disposing of used dressings and washing your hands after touching affected areas of skin, can help prevent boils and carbuncles spreading. Treating boils and carbuncles Most boils can be treated at home. One of the best ways to speed up healing is to apply a warm face cloth to the boil three or four times a day. If your boil doesn't heal, your GP may decide to drain it. Never attempt to squeeze or pierce a boil or carbuncle because it could cause the infection to spread and may lead to complications. If you develop a carbuncle or there's a high risk of your boil causing complications, you may be prescribed a week-long course of antibiotics. Further testing, such as taking a skin swab or a blood test, may be required if you have: a boil or carbuncle that keeps returning or doesn't respond to treatment \u2013 it may be caused by bacteria other than staph bacteria, so an antiseptic solution may be prescribed multiple boils or carbuncles a weakened immune system caused by a condition such as diabetes, or if you're having a treatment such as chemotherapy Read more about treating boils and carbuncles. Complications Although most boils get better without causing further problems, some people develop a secondary infection. This can range from a relatively minor (though often very painful) infection of the deeper layer of the skin, such as cellulitis, to rarer and more serious infections, such as blood poisoning (sepsis). Larger boils and carbuncles can also lead to scarring. Complications are more likely to occur if boils and carbuncles aren't treated properly.

Around 550 new cases are diagnosed each year in the UK. This is a separate condition from secondary bone cancer, which is cancer that spreads to the bones after developing in another part of the body. These pages only refer to primary bone cancer. The Macmillan Cancer Support website has more information about secondary bone cancer. Signs and symptoms of bone cancer Bone cancer can affect any bone, but most cases develop in the long bones of the legs or upper arms. The main symptoms include: persistent bone pain that gets worse over time and continues into the night swelling and redness (inflammation) over a bone, which can make movement difficult if the affected bone is near a joint a noticeable lump over a bone a weak bone that breaks (fractures) more easily than normal If you or your child are experiencing persistent, severe or worsening bone pain, visit your GP. While it's highly unlikely to be the result of bone cancer, it does require further investigation. Read more about the symptoms of bone cancer. Types of bone cancer Some of the main types of bone cancer are: osteosarcoma \u2013 the most common type, which mostly affects children and young adults under 20 Ewing sarcoma \u2013 which most commonly affects people aged between 10 and 20 chondrosarcoma \u2013 which tends to affect adults aged over 40 Young people can be affected because the rapid growth spurts that occur during puberty may make bone tumours develop. The above types of bone cancer affect different types of cell. The treatment and outlook will depend on the type of bone cancer you have. What causes bone cancer? In most cases, it's not known why a person develops bone cancer. You're more at risk of developing it if you: have had previous exposure to radiation during radiotherapy have a condition known as Paget\u2019s disease of the bone \u2013 however, only a very small number of people with Paget\u2019s disease will actually develop bone cancer have a rare genetic condition called Li-Fraumeni syndrome \u2013 people with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that normally helps stop the growth of cancerous cells Read more about the causes of bone cancer. How bone cancer is treated Treatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have and how far it has spread. Most people have a combination of: surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone \u2013 it's often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that's been removed, but amputation is sometimes necessary chemotherapy \u2013 treatment with powerful cancer-killing medication radiotherapy \u2013 where radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells In some cases of osteosarcoma, a medication called mifamurtide may also be recommended. Read more about treating bone cancer. Outlook The outlook for bone cancer depends on factors such as your age, the type of bone cancer you have, how far the cancer has spread (the stage), and how likely it is to spread further (the grade). Generally, bone cancer is much easier to cure in otherwise healthy people whose cancer hasn't spread. Overall, around 6 in every 10 people with bone cancer will live for at least 5 years from the time of their diagnosis, and many of these may be cured completely. For more detailed statistics broken down by the different types of bone cancer, see the page on statistics and outlook for bone cancer on the Cancer Research UK website.

They can occur at any age, but most often affect children and young adults. Bone cysts don't usually cause any symptoms. They are not cancerous and they do not usually pose a serious threat to health. However, large cysts can cause a bone to weaken, making it more likely to fracture (break). This can cause problems such as pain, swelling, or not being able to move or put weight on a body part. Read more about the symptoms of bone cysts. Types of bone cysts There are two main types of bone cysts. Unicameral bone cysts Unicameral bone cysts are the most common type of bone cyst. They can develop anywhere in the body, although most cases involve either the upper arm or thigh. The condition tends to affect younger children between 5 and 15 years of age. Boys are about twice as likely to have unicameral bone cysts as girls. The exact cause of unicameral bone cysts is unknown, but a leading theory suggests they may occur due to problems with the drainage of interstitial fluid from growing sections of bone. Aneurysmal bone cysts Aneurysmal bone cysts are a rarer type of bone cyst where the bone contains a pocket of blood. They can also develop anywhere in the body, but most often affect the legs, upper arms, pelvis or spine. Most cases affect children and young people aged between 10 and 20. It's thought that aneurysmal bone cysts may be slightly more common in females than males. The exact cause of aneurysmal bone cysts is not clear. They may occur because of an abnormality in the blood vessels inside affected bones, which develop as a result of a previous injury or a non-cancerous growth inside the bone. Diagnosing bone cysts Bone cysts can usually be diagnosed by looking at an X-ray of the affected bone. This will highlight any hollow cavities or fractures in the bone. In many cases, a bone cyst will only be discovered by chance when X-rays are used to diagnose an unrelated condition, or after an affected bone has fractured. A computerised tomography (CT) scan, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and\/or a biopsy (where a sample of fluid is removed from the bone with a needle and tested) may sometimes be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. How bone cysts are treated Many bone cysts will eventually heal without the need for treatment and won't cause long-term problems \u2013 particularly unicameral bone cysts in children, which will usually disappear by the time they stop growing. If a bone cyst does not get better, or if treatment is recommended to help reduce the risk of a fracture, several options may be available. For example, steroid medication can be injected into the bone to encourage the cyst to heal. If this doesn't help, surgery may be needed to drain the fluid and fill the hole with chips of bone. There is a significant chance of the cyst recurring after treatment, so you may need to have regular X-rays for a few years afterwards to look for signs of the condition returning. Read more about treating bone cysts. Bone cysts are usually picked up during an X-ray  X-ray An X-ray is a common procedure used to produce images of the inside of the body Page last reviewed: 24\/11\/2014 Next review due: 24\/11\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

DEXA stands for \"dual energy X-ray absorptiometry\". This type of scan may also be called: a DXA scan a bone density scan a bone densitometry scan DEXA scans are often used to diagnose or assess someone's risk of osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones and makes them more likely to break. As well as being quick and painless, a DEXA scan is more effective than normal X-rays in identifying low bone mineral density. Osteoporosis You may need to have a DEXA scan if you're: over 50 years of age with a risk of developing osteoporosis under 50 with other risk factors \u2013 such as smoking or a previous fracture The World Health Organization (WHO) has created a 10-year Fracture Risk Assessment Tool, which applies to both men and women between 40 and 90 years of age. The tool can be used to assess if a DEXA scan is appropriate and calculates your risk of fracture in the next 10 years. Osteoporosis can affect people of both sexes and all ages, although older, post-menopausal women are particularly at risk. This is because after the menopause the level of oestrogen declines, resulting in a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD). The more dense your bones, the stronger and less likely they are to fracture (break). Osteoporosis doesn't cause any symptoms until a bone is broken. It used to be difficult to measure bone density and identify those at risk of developing osteoporosis until a fracture occurred. However, it's now possible to measure bone density before someone gets a fracture. Read more about when DEXA scans are used. Measuring bone density During a DEXA scan, X-rays are passed through your body. Some radiation is absorbed by the bone and soft tissue and some travels through your body. Special detectors in the DEXA scanner measure how much radiation passes through your bones, and this information is sent to a computer. Your bone density measurements will be compared with the bone density of a young healthy adult or an adult of your own age, gender and ethnicity. Read more about how DEXA scans are carried out. Safety DEXA scans use a much lower level of radiation than standard X-ray examinations, which means that the radiographer (the technical specialist carrying out the scan) can stay in the scanning room with you during the scan. The amount of radiation used during a DEXA scan varies depending on the area of the body being examined, but is very low and less than two days' exposure to natural background radiation (NBR). By comparison, a chest X-ray uses the equivalent of about three days' exposure to NBR, and a flight to North America is equivalent to approximately a week's exposure to NBR. Despite being very safe procedures, DEXA scans and X-rays aren't recommended for pregnant women, as X-rays can damage an unborn child. Read more about your health during pregnancy.

Falls are a common, but often overlooked, cause of injury. Around one in three adults over 65 who live at home will have at least one fall a year, and about half of these will have more frequent falls. Most falls don't result in serious injury. However, there's always a risk that a fall could lead to broken bones, and it can cause the person to lose confidence, become withdrawn and feel as if they've lost their independence. What should I do if I fall? If you have a fall, it's important to keep calm. If you're not hurt and you feel strong enough to get up, don't get up quickly. Roll onto your hands and knees and look for a stable piece of furniture, such as a chair or bed. Hold on to the furniture with both hands to support yourself and, when you feel ready, slowly get up. Sit down and rest for a while before carrying on with your daily activities. If you're hurt or unable to get up, try to get someone's attention by calling out for help, banging on the wall or floor, or using your aid call button (if you have one). If possible, crawl to a telephone and dial 999 to request an ambulance. Try to reach something warm, such as a blanket or dressing gown, to put over you, particularly your legs and feet. Stay as comfortable as possible and try to change your position at least once every half an hour or so. If you're living with or caring for an elderly person, see accidents and first aid for information and advice about what to do after an accident. What causes a fall? The natural ageing process means that older people have an increased risk of having a fall. In the UK, falls are the most common cause of injury related deaths in people over the age of 75. Older people are more likely to have a fall because they may have: balance problems and muscle weakness  poor vision a long-term health condition, such as heart disease, dementia or low blood pressure (hypotension), which can lead to dizziness and a brief loss of consciousness A fall is also more likely to happen when: the floor is wet or recently polished, such as in the bathroom the lighting in the room is dim rugs or carpets aren't properly secured the person is reaching for storage areas, such as a cupboard, or is going down stairs the person is rushing to get to the toilet during the day or at night Another common cause of falls, particularly among older men, is falling from a ladder while carrying out home maintenance work. In older people, falls can be particularly problematic because osteoporosis is a fairly common problem. Osteoporosis can develop in both men and women, particularly in people who smoke, drink excessive amounts of alcohol, take steroid medication or have a family history of hip fractures. However, older women are most at risk, because it's often associated with the hormonal changes that occur during the menopause. Preventing a fall There are several measures you can take to help prevent a fall. Simple everyday measures around the home include: using non-slip mats in the bathroom mopping up spills to prevent wet, slippery floors getting help lifting or moving items that are heavy or difficult to lift Removing clutter and ensuring all areas of the home are well lit can also help to prevent falls. The charity Age UK has advice about how to make tasks easier around the home. Healthcare professionals take falls in older people very seriously, because of the huge consequences they can have for the health and wellbeing of this group. As a result, there's a great deal of help and support available for older people, and it's worth asking your GP about the various options. Your GP may carry out some simple tests to check your balance. They can also review any medicines you're taking, in case their side effects may increase your risk of falling. Your GP may also recommend: having a sight test if you're having problems with your vision, even if you already wear glasses having an electrocardiogram (ECG) and checking your blood pressure while lying and standing  requesting a home hazard assessment, where a healthcare professional visits your home to identify potential hazards and offer advice doing exercises to improve your strength and balance (try some exercises for older people) Read more about preventing falls.

It causes the bones to become soft and weak, which can lead to bone deformities. Rickets in adults is known as osteomalacia or soft bones. Rickets can cause bone pain, poor growth and deformities of the skeleton, such as bowed legs, curvature of the spine, and thickening of the ankles, wrists and knees. Children with rickets are also more likely to fracture their bones. Read more about the signs and symptoms of rickets. What causes rickets? A lack of vitamin D or calcium is the most common cause of rickets. Vitamin D largely comes from exposing the skin to sunlight, but it's also found in some foods, such as oily fish and eggs. Vitamin D is essential for the formation of strong and healthy bones in children. In rare cases, children can be born with a genetic form of rickets. It can also develop if another condition affects how vitamins and minerals are absorbed by the body. Read more about the causes of rickets. Who's affected? Rickets was common in the past, but it mostly disappeared in the western world during the early 20th century after foods like margarine and cereal were fortified with vitamin D. However, in recent years, there's been an increase in cases of rickets in the UK. The number of rickets cases is still relatively small \u2013 less than 700 cases were diagnosed in hospitals in England in 2013-14 \u2013 but studies have shown a significant number of people in the UK have low levels of vitamin D in their blood. Any child whose diet doesn't contain enough vitamin D or calcium can develop rickets, but the condition is more common in children with dark skin, as this means they need more sunlight to get enough vitamin D, as well as children born prematurely or taking medication that interferes with vitamin D. Treating rickets For most children, rickets can be successfully treated by ensuring they eat foods that contain calcium and vitamin D, or by taking vitamin supplements. Some families are eligible for free vitamin supplements from the government's Healthy Start scheme \u2013 find out if you qualify for Healthy Start. If your child has problems absorbing vitamins and minerals, they may need a higher supplement dose or a yearly vitamin D injection. Read more about treating rickets. Preventing rickets Rickets can easily be prevented by eating a diet that includes vitamin D and calcium, spending some time in sunlight, and if necessary, taking vitamin D supplements. Read more about: preventing rickets who should take vitamin D supplements how much vitamin D adults, children and babies need When to seek medical advice Take your child to see your GP if they have any of the signs and symptoms of rickets. Your GP will carry out a physical examination to check for any obvious problems. They may also discuss your child's medical history, diet, family history, and any medication they're taking. A blood test to measure calcium, phosphorous and vitamin D levels can usually confirm a diagnosis of rickets, although your child may also have some X-rays or possibly a bone density scan (DEXA scan). This is a type of X-ray that measures the calcium content in bones.

They often form next to joints affected by osteoarthritis (a condition that causes joints to become painful and stiff). Osteophytes can grow from any bone, but they're most often found in the: neck shoulder knee lower back fingers or big toe foot or heel Osteophyte symptoms Osteophytes don't always cause symptoms. They can cause problems if they: rub against other bone or tissue restrict movement squeeze nearby nerves For example, osteophytes that occur in the: spine can cause pain and stiffness in the back neck can pinch a nearby nerve and cause pain, pins and needles, numbness or weakness in the arms shoulder can limit the space available for tendons and ligaments, and may be linked to tendonitis or a rotator cuff tear hip and knee can reduce the range of movement and are often associated with painful arthritis  knee may cause pain when you bend and extend your leg fingers can cause lumps What causes osteophytes? Osteophytes tend to form when the joints have been affected by arthritis. Osteoarthritis damages cartilage, which is the tough, white, flexible tissue that lines the bones and allows the joints to move easily. Osteoarthritis mostly occurs in the knees, hips, spine and small joints of the hands and base of the big toe. As the joints become increasingly damaged, new bone may form around the joints. These bony growths are called osteophytes. Osteophytes can also form in the spine as a result of ankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis that specifically affects the spine). When to seek medical advice See your GP if you have joint pain or stiffness, or if you have other symptoms in an area of your body, such as numbness or nerve pain. They'll investigate the underlying cause.   Your GP will ask you about your symptoms and they may examine the affected area. They may test your joint movements and muscle strength. They'll also look at your medical history.  You may be referred for an X-ray, which will highlight any arthritis in the joint and osteophytes. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is better for examining torn ligaments or tendons. Treating osteophytes Osteophytes don't usually cause pain, but the associated arthritis might. If you're in pain, over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, may help. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which can also help reduce any swelling and inflammation. If you're overweight, losing weight will help by relieving some of the strain on your joints. A physiotherapist may also be able to help you by recommending exercises that can strengthen the muscles surrounding the problem area, and by helping to improve your range of movement. Surgery can sometimes be used to help manage any underlying arthritis in the joint. It can be helpful for osteoarthritis that affects your hips, knees or joints, particularly those at the base of your thumb. Read more about treating osteoarthritis. There's usually no need to remove an osteophyte, unless it's irritating a nerve in the spine or restricting a joint's range of movement. If you do need surgery to remove an osteophyte, your surgeon will explain the procedure's risks and benefits.

The most common injuries in people with osteoporosis are: wrist fractures hip fractures fractures of the spinal bones (vertebrae) However, they can also occur in other bones, such as in the arm or pelvis. Sometimes a cough or sneeze can cause a rib fracture or the partial collapse of one of the bones of the spine. Osteoporosis isn't usually painful until a fracture occurs, but spinal fractures are a common cause of long-term (chronic) pain. Although a fracture is the first sign of osteoporosis, some older people develop the characteristic stooped (bent forward) posture. It happens when the bones in the spine have fractured, making it difficult to support the weight of the body. Who's affected? Osteoporosis affects over three million people in the UK. More than 500,000 people receive hospital treatment for fragility fractures (fractures that occur from standing height or less) every year as a result of osteoporosis. Causes of osteoporosis Losing bone is a normal part of the ageing process, but some people lose bone density much faster than normal. This can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures. Women also lose bone rapidly in the first few years after the menopause (when monthly periods stop and the ovaries stop producing an egg). Women are more at risk of osteoporosis than men, particularly if the menopause begins early (before the age of 45). Many other factors can also increase the risk of developing osteoporosis, including: long-term use of high-dose oral corticosteroids other medical conditions \u2013 such as inflammatory conditions, hormone-related conditions, or malabsorption problems a family history of osteoporosis \u2013 particularly history of a hip fracture in a parent long-term use of certain medications which can affect bone strength or hormone levels having a low body mass index (BMI) heavy drinking and smoking Read more about the causes of osteoporosis. Diagnosing osteoporosis Risk assessment tools If your doctor suspects you have osteoporosis, they can make an assessment using an online programme, such as FRAX or Q-Fracture. These tools help to predict a person's risk of fracture between the ages of 40 and 90. The algorithms used give a 10-year probability of hip fracture and a 10-year probability of a major fracture in the spine, hip, shoulder or forearm. DEXA scan They may also refer you for a DEXA (DXA) scan to measure your bone mineral density. It's a short, painless procedure that takes about five minutes, depending on the part of the body being scanned. Your bone mineral density can be compared to the bone mineral density of a healthy young adult and someone who's the same age and sex as you. The difference is calculated as a standard deviation (SD) and is called a T score. Standard deviation is a measure of variability based on an average or expected value. A T score of: above -1 SD is normal  between -1 and -2.5 SD is defined as decreased bone mineral density compared with peak bone mass below -2.5 is defined as osteoporosis Osteopenia You may be diagnosed with osteopenia if bone density tests show you have decreased bone density, but not enough to be classed as osteoporosis. Your doctor may still recommend some of the treatments described below, depending on your results and your risk of fracture. Treating osteoporosis Treatment for osteoporosis is based on treating and preventing fractures, and using medication to strengthen bones. The decision about whether you need treatment depends on your risk of fracture. This will be based on a number of factors such as your age, sex and the results of your DEXA scan. If you need treatment, your doctor can suggest the safest and most effective treatment plan for you. Read more about how osteoporosis is treated. Preventing osteoporosis If you're at risk of developing osteoporosis, you should take steps to help keep your bones healthy. This may include: taking regular exercise healthy eating \u2013 including foods rich in calcium and vitamin D taking a daily supplement containing 10 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D making lifestyle changes \u2013 such as giving up smoking and reducing your alcohol consumption Read more about preventing osteoporosis. Living with osteoporosis If you're diagnosed with osteoporosis, there are steps you can take to reduce your chances of a fall, such as removing hazards from your home and having regular sight tests and hearing tests. To help you recover from a fracture, you can try using: hot and cold treatments such as warm baths and cold packs transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) \u2013 where a small battery-operated device is used to stimulate the nerves and reduce pain relaxation techniques Speak to your GP or nurse if you're worried about living with a long-term condition. They may be able to answer any questions you have. You may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or other people with the condition. The National Osteoporosis Society can put you in touch with local support groups, and they also have an online discussion forum. Read more about living with osteoporosis. At-risk groups Osteoporosis often affects women, particularly after the menopause (when monthly periods stop). However, it can also sometimes affect men, younger women and children. Other groups who are at risk of developing osteoporosis include: people who have been taking steroid medication for more than three months women who have had their ovaries removed people with a family history of osteoporosis people with an eating disorder, such as anorexia or bulimia  people who don't exercise regularly people who smoke or drink heavily Page last reviewed: 20\/06\/2016 Next review due: 20\/06\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It causes the bones to become soft and weak, which can lead to bone deformities. Rickets in adults is known as osteomalacia or soft bones. Rickets can cause bone pain, poor growth and deformities of the skeleton, such as bowed legs, curvature of the spine, and thickening of the ankles, wrists and knees. Children with rickets are also more likely to fracture their bones. Read more about the signs and symptoms of rickets. What causes rickets? A lack of vitamin D or calcium is the most common cause of rickets. Vitamin D largely comes from exposing the skin to sunlight, but it's also found in some foods, such as oily fish and eggs. Vitamin D is essential for the formation of strong and healthy bones in children. In rare cases, children can be born with a genetic form of rickets. It can also develop if another condition affects how vitamins and minerals are absorbed by the body. Read more about the causes of rickets. Who's affected? Rickets was common in the past, but it mostly disappeared in the western world during the early 20th century after foods like margarine and cereal were fortified with vitamin D. However, in recent years, there's been an increase in cases of rickets in the UK. The number of rickets cases is still relatively small \u2013 less than 700 cases were diagnosed in hospitals in England in 2013-14 \u2013 but studies have shown a significant number of people in the UK have low levels of vitamin D in their blood. Any child whose diet doesn't contain enough vitamin D or calcium can develop rickets, but the condition is more common in children with dark skin, as this means they need more sunlight to get enough vitamin D, as well as children born prematurely or taking medication that interferes with vitamin D. Treating rickets For most children, rickets can be successfully treated by ensuring they eat foods that contain calcium and vitamin D, or by taking vitamin supplements. Some families are eligible for free vitamin supplements from the government's Healthy Start scheme \u2013 find out if you qualify for Healthy Start. If your child has problems absorbing vitamins and minerals, they may need a higher supplement dose or a yearly vitamin D injection. Read more about treating rickets. Preventing rickets Rickets can easily be prevented by eating a diet that includes vitamin D and calcium, spending some time in sunlight, and if necessary, taking vitamin D supplements. Read more about: preventing rickets who should take vitamin D supplements how much vitamin D adults, children and babies need When to seek medical advice Take your child to see your GP if they have any of the signs and symptoms of rickets. Your GP will carry out a physical examination to check for any obvious problems. They may also discuss your child's medical history, diet, family history, and any medication they're taking. A blood test to measure calcium, phosphorous and vitamin D levels can usually confirm a diagnosis of rickets, although your child may also have some X-rays or possibly a bone density scan (DEXA scan). This is a type of X-ray that measures the calcium content in bones.

Osteomyelitis most commonly affects the long bones in the legs, but other bones, such as those in the back or arms, can also be affected. Symptoms of osteomyelitis may include: a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above bone pain, which can often be intense swelling, redness and a warm sensation in the affected area  Read more about the symptoms of osteomyelitis. The condition is often referred to as either: acute osteomyelitis \u2013 when the infection develops following an injury, infection or underlying condition chronic osteomyelitis \u2013 when the condition regularly returns When to see your GP Osteomyelitis can affect people of any age, so visit your GP if you or your child experiences persistent bone pain with a fever. Very young children do not always develop a fever when they have osteomyelitis and they may not be able to communicate any bone pain. You should see your GP if your child becomes irritable, has a reduced appetite and is reluctant to use a certain part of their body (most often an arm or leg). Why does osteomyelitis happen? Osteomyelitis develops when the bone becomes infected. In most cases, bacteria is responsible for the infection, although it can also be caused by fungi. Blood tests and a biopsy may be used to determine whether you have an infection and what caused it. Read more about diagnosing osteomyelitis. There are two ways the infection can occur: following an injury (known as contiguous osteomyelitis) \u2013 such as a fractured bone, animal bite or during surgery via the bloodstream (known as haematogenous osteomyelitis) Contiguous osteomyelitis is more common in adults, whereas haematogenous osteomyelitis is more common in children. Certain things can increase your chances of developing osteomyelitis. For example, if you have a condition that affects the blood supply to certain parts of your body, such as diabetes, or a condition that weakens the immune system, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Osteomyelitis is also known to be a common complication of certain health conditions. For example: 30-40% of people with diabetes who experience a puncture injury to their foot will develop osteomyelitis less than one in every 200 people with sickle cell anaemia will develop osteomyelitis in any given year Osteomyelitis can become chronic osteomyelitis if not treated quickly, as the bones can become permanently damaged, resulting in persistent pain and loss of function. Read more about the causes of osteomyelitis. How is osteomyelitis treated? If diagnosed early, osteomyelitis can be treated with antibiotics for at least four to six weeks. At first, you may have to stay in hospital to receive antibiotics, but you should be able to take them at home when you start to get better. In severe or chronic cases of osteomyelitis, surgery may be used in combination with antibiotics. Surgery is most often used to remove damaged bone and drain pus from wounds. Read more about treating osteomyelitis. Complications Although osteomyelitis is usually treated successfully with antibiotics, chronic and severe cases can lead to other problems. Recurring osteomyelitis If you've had a previous episode of osteomyelitis, there's a chance of it returning. This is because underlying conditions that often cause osteomyelitis, such as poor circulation or a weakened immune system, can be difficult to treat. Gangrene If the blood supply to the bone is severely reduced, this can cause the tissue to die (gangrene). Amputation may be used as a last resort if gangrene develops. However, the condition can usually be treated before it reaches this stage. Preventing osteomyelitis It's not always possible to avoid getting osteomyelitis. But there are steps you can take to reduce your chances. Cleaning wounds thoroughly with water and dressing them in a clean bandage will reduce your chances of getting an infection from an injury. Improving your general health will help reduce the risk of developing conditions that can lead to osteomyelitis. Read more about preventing osteomyelitis.

Diseased or damaged bone marrow can be replaced by donated bone marrow cells, which help treat and often cure many life-threatening conditions, including: bone marrow failure (severe aplastic anaemia) leukaemia \u2013 cancer of the white blood cells, which has several sub-types non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \u2013 cancer of the lymphatic system certain genetic blood and immune system disorders such as sickle cell anaemia, thalassaemia and some severe immune system diseases Read more about the uses of a bone marrow transplant. After the donation, as long as the transplant is successful, the new bone marrow will begin to make healthy blood cells and the person receiving the donation will start to get better. What is bone marrow? Bone marrow is a spongy tissue found in the hollow centres of some bones. It contains stem cells which can grow into any of our normal blood cells. Stem cells in bone marrow produce three important types of blood cells: red blood cells \u2013 which carry oxygen around the body white blood cells \u2013 which help fight infection platelets \u2013 which help stop bleeding  The need for donors Ideally, bone marrow stem cells are best donated from a close family member, such as a brother or sister, because there needs to be a close match between tissue types. However, only around one in three people have a close relative with a matching tissue type. For this reason a number of bone marrow registers have been set up listing people who are willing to donate bone marrow stem cells if required. When a donation is needed, doctors search the bone marrow register to try to find a donor with a matching tissue type. In England, there are two bone marrow registers, which work closely together: the British Bone Marrow Registry, which is part of the NHS the Anthony Nolan Trust register, which is operated by the charity the Anthony Nolan Trust You can apply to join the British Bone Marrow Registry when you donate blood. It is possible for most people to find a donor on the registers, but a small number of people with rare tissue types may find it very hard or impossible to find a suitable match. How it is performed Firstly you will be asked to provide a small sample of blood to determine your tissue type. This information is kept on the register. You will be contacted if you are a potential match for a person requiring a transplant. The most widely used method of donating bone marrow is known as a peripheral blood stem cell donation (PBSC). You will need to receive injections for four days in a row to increase the number of stem cells in your circulating blood before this type of donation. You will have to visit the hospital or clinic for four days in a row to receive injections which stimulate the production of stem cells.  On the fifth day you will be connected to a cell-separator machine without the need for a general anaesthetic. The machine usually collects the stem cells from your blood through a vein in one arm, returning the blood to your body through a vein in your other arm. This takes about four or five hours and may need to be repeated the following day. Read more about what happens during a bone marrow donation. Who can donate bone marrow If you would like to become a potential bone marrow donor, you must be: 17 to 40 years of age to join the British Bone Marrow Registry 16 to 30 years of age to join the Anthony Nolan Trust register in good general health over 7 stone 12 pounds (50kg) in weight have a body mass index (BMI) lower than 40 It is best to join the bone marrow register at a young age. The younger you are when you join, the more chance there is of your tissue type being matched to that of someone who needs it. Read more about who can donate bone marrow. Ethnic minority donors There are currently thousands of people on the bone marrow register. Before someone can donate their bone marrow, it must closely match that of the person who needs it. This is why it is so important to include people from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds. At the moment, certain ethnic communities are under represented on the bone marrow register. This means it is more difficult to find suitable donors for members of these communities who require a bone marrow transplant. In particular, there is a shortage of potential donors for the following ethnic groups: African African-Caribbean South Asian (people of Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Bangladeshi origin) Chinese Jewish people of European descent Eastern European Southern European (such as people of Greek, Italian and Spanish origin) Page last reviewed: 14\/05\/2014 Next review due: 14\/05\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It can be used to treat conditions affecting the blood cells, such as leukaemia and lymphoma. Stem cells are special cells produced by bone marrow (a spongy tissue found in the centre of some bones) that can turn into different types of blood cells. The three main types of blood cell they can become are: red blood cells \u2013 which carry oxygen around the body white blood cells \u2013 which help fight infection platelets \u2013 which help stop bleeding A stem cell transplant involves destroying any unhealthy blood cells and replacing them with stem cells removed from the blood or bone marrow. Why are stem cell transplants carried out? Stem cell transplants are used to treat conditions in which the bone marrow is damaged and is no longer able to produce healthy blood cells. Transplants can also be carried out to replace blood cells that are damaged or destroyed as a result of intensive cancer treatment. Conditions that stem cell transplants can be used to treat include: severe aplastic anaemia (bone marrow failure) leukaemia \u2013 a type of cancer affecting white blood cells lymphoma \u2013 another type of cancer affecting white blood cells myeloma \u2013 cancer affecting cells called plasma cells certain blood, immune system and metabolic disorders \u2013 examples include sickle cell anaemia, thalassaemia, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and Hurler syndrome A stem cell transplant will usually only be carried out if other treatments haven't helped, the potential benefits of a transplant outweigh the risks and you're in relatively good health, despite your underlying condition. What does a stem cell transplant involve? A stem cell transplant can involve taking healthy stem cells from the blood or bone marrow of one person \u2013 ideally a close family member with the same or similar tissue type (see below) \u2013 and transferring them to another person. This is called an allogeneic transplant. It's also possible to remove stem cells from your own body and transplant them later, after any damaged or diseased cells have been removed. This is called an autologous transplant. A stem cell transplant has five main stages. These are: Tests and examinations \u2013 to assess your general level of health. Harvesting \u2013 the process of obtaining the stem cells to be used in the transplant, either from you or a donor. Conditioning \u2013 treatment with chemotherapy and\/or radiotherapy to prepare your body for the transplant. Transplanting the stem cells Recovery Having a stem cell transplant can be an intensive and challenging experience. You'll usually need to stay in hospital for a month or more until the transplant starts to take effect and it can take a year or two to fully recover. Read more about what happens during a stem cell transplant. Risks of a stem cell transplant Stem cell transplants are complicated procedures with significant risks. It's important that you're aware of both the risks and possible benefits before treatment begins. Possible problems that can occur during or after the transplant process include: graft versus host disease (GvHD) \u2013 this occurs in allogeneic transplants when the transplanted cells start to attack the other cells in your body reduced number of blood cells \u2013 this can lead to anaemia, excessive bleeding or bruising, and an increased risk of infections chemotherapy side effects \u2013 including sickness, tiredness, hair loss and infertility Read more about the risks of having a stem cell transplant. Stem cell donation If it isn't possible to use your own stem cells for the transplant (see above), stem cells will need to come from a donor. To improve the chances of the transplant being successful, donated stem cells need to carry a special genetic marker \u2013 known as a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) \u2013 that's identical or very similar to that of the person receiving the transplant. The best chance of getting a match is from a brother or sister, or sometimes another close family member. If there are no matches in your close family, a search of the British Bone Marrow Registry will be carried out. Most people will eventually find a donor in the registry, although a small number of people may find it very hard or impossible to find a suitable match. Read more about stem cell donation.

They often form next to joints affected by osteoarthritis (a condition that causes joints to become painful and stiff). Osteophytes can grow from any bone, but they're most often found in the: neck shoulder knee lower back fingers or big toe foot or heel Osteophyte symptoms Osteophytes don't always cause symptoms. They can cause problems if they: rub against other bone or tissue restrict movement squeeze nearby nerves For example, osteophytes that occur in the: spine can cause pain and stiffness in the back neck can pinch a nearby nerve and cause pain, pins and needles, numbness or weakness in the arms shoulder can limit the space available for tendons and ligaments, and may be linked to tendonitis or a rotator cuff tear hip and knee can reduce the range of movement and are often associated with painful arthritis  knee may cause pain when you bend and extend your leg fingers can cause lumps What causes osteophytes? Osteophytes tend to form when the joints have been affected by arthritis. Osteoarthritis damages cartilage, which is the tough, white, flexible tissue that lines the bones and allows the joints to move easily. Osteoarthritis mostly occurs in the knees, hips, spine and small joints of the hands and base of the big toe. As the joints become increasingly damaged, new bone may form around the joints. These bony growths are called osteophytes. Osteophytes can also form in the spine as a result of ankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis that specifically affects the spine). When to seek medical advice See your GP if you have joint pain or stiffness, or if you have other symptoms in an area of your body, such as numbness or nerve pain. They'll investigate the underlying cause.   Your GP will ask you about your symptoms and they may examine the affected area. They may test your joint movements and muscle strength. They'll also look at your medical history.  You may be referred for an X-ray, which will highlight any arthritis in the joint and osteophytes. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is better for examining torn ligaments or tendons. Treating osteophytes Osteophytes don't usually cause pain, but the associated arthritis might. If you're in pain, over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, may help. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which can also help reduce any swelling and inflammation. If you're overweight, losing weight will help by relieving some of the strain on your joints. A physiotherapist may also be able to help you by recommending exercises that can strengthen the muscles surrounding the problem area, and by helping to improve your range of movement. Surgery can sometimes be used to help manage any underlying arthritis in the joint. It can be helpful for osteoarthritis that affects your hips, knees or joints, particularly those at the base of your thumb. Read more about treating osteoarthritis. There's usually no need to remove an osteophyte, unless it's irritating a nerve in the spine or restricting a joint's range of movement. If you do need surgery to remove an osteophyte, your surgeon will explain the procedure's risks and benefits.

A girl with Turner syndrome only has one normal X sex chromosome, rather than the usual two (XX). This chromosome variation happens randomly when the baby is conceived in the womb. It is not linked to the mother's age. Read more about the genetic cause of Turner syndrome.  Characteristics of Turner syndrome Females with Turner syndrome often have a wide range of symptoms and some distinctive characteristics. Almost all girls with Turner syndrome: are shorter than average have underdeveloped ovaries (female reproductive organs), resulting in a lack of monthly periods and infertility As height and sexual development are the two main characteristics, Turner syndrome may not be diagnosed until a girl fails to show sexual development associated with puberty, usually between the ages of 8 and 14 years. Other characteristics of Turner syndrome can vary significantly between individuals. Read more about the symptoms of Turner syndrome and how Turner syndrome is diagnosed. Treating Turner syndrome There is no cure for Turner syndrome, but many of the associated symptoms can be treated. Girls and women with Turner syndrome will need to have regular health checks of their heart, kidneys and reproductive system throughout their lives. However, it is usually possible to lead a relatively normal and healthy life. Life expectancy is slightly reduced, but it can be improved with regular health checks to identify and treat potential problems at an early stage. Read more about treating Turner syndrome. Information about you If you or your daughter has Turner syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you\/your daughter on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).

This could include: overwhelming feelings of distress, anxiety, worthlessness or anger difficulty managing such feelings without self-harming \u2013 for example, by abusing drugs and alcohol or taking overdoses difficulty maintaining stable and close relationships sometimes having periods of loss of contact with reality in some cases, threats of harm to others Read more about the symptoms of borderline personality disorder. Personality disorders typically emerge in adolescence and persist into adulthood. They may be associated with genetic and family factors, and experiences of distress or fear during childhood, such as neglect or abuse, are common. Personality disorders range from mild to severe. What is borderline personality disorder (BPD)? It used to be thought that people with BPD were at the \"border\" between: neurosis \u2013 where a person is mentally distressed, but can still tell the difference between their perception and reality psychosis \u2013 where a person is unable to tell the difference between their perception and reality, and may experience delusions and hallucinations Now it's known that this is not an accurate description. BPD is best understood as a disorder of mood and how a person interacts with others. BPD is a common personality disorder seen by healthcare professionals. Although BPD is said to be more common in women, this is probably because it is recognised less frequently in men, who may be less likely to seek treatment. Read more about how BPD is diagnosed. How does BPD develop? The causes of BPD are unclear. However, as with most conditions, BPD appears to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Traumatic events that occur during childhood are associated with developing BPD. An estimated 8 out of 10 people with BPD experience parental neglect or physical, sexual or emotional abuse during their childhood. Read more about the causes of BPD. Outlook BPD can be a serious condition, and many people with the condition self-harm and attempt suicide. It is estimated that 60-70% of people with BPD will attempt suicide at some point in their life. However, for many with BPD, the outlook is reasonably good over time, and psychological or medical treatment may help. Treatment may involve a range of individual and group psychological therapies (psychotherapy) carried out by trained professionals working with a community mental health team. Effective treatment may last more than a year. Read more about treatments for BPD. Recent studies have suggested that the majority of those with BPD do well over time, with most experiencing sustained relief from symptoms, and around half being completely free of symptoms and able to function well. Additional treatment is recommended for people whose symptoms return. Mental and emotional health: talking therapies Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

The lining of the lungs is also sometimes affected. The condition is sometimes known as pleurodynia, or epidemic pleurodynia. Symptoms The main symptom of Bornholm disease is severe stabbing chest pain, which is often made worse by deep breathing, coughing or sudden movements. The pain tends to come and go, with episodes lasting 15 to 30 minutes. Bornholm disease sometimes also causes tummy pain, fever, headache, a sore throat and muscle pain. These symptoms usually start suddenly and persist for several days before going away without the need for treatment. They may return, however. How the infection is spread Bornholm disease is caused by a group of viruses called enteroviruses, mainly the Coxsackie B virus. It spreads by the faecal-oral route, where traces of contaminated faeces (poo) reach the mouth. Less commonly, it can be spread through respiratory droplets in much the same way as the common cold. The viruses are found in faeces and the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when someone with the condition coughs or sneezes. Hands, water or food can become contaminated by the virus. Respiratory droplets can also hang suspended in the air before falling to contaminate surfaces. Anyone who touches these surfaces can spread the virus by touching something else. A person usually becomes infected by picking up the virus on their hands from contaminated objects, such as a nappy or toilet, and then placing their hands in their mouth. Other ways the virus can be spread include drinking contaminated water and breathing in contaminated droplets from the air. This is why it's very important to wash your hands properly and avoid sharing utensils if you've been infected with the virus or if someone close to you has Bornholm disease. Newborn babies It's possible for an infected mother to pass the virus on to her newborn baby. Infection in newborns varies in severity. Some babies won't have any symptoms, while others will have a severe or even fatal illness. Babies with severe illness may benefit from immunoglobulin treatment. Advice should be sought from medical virologists (specialists in the treatment of viruses), infectious disease doctors, or the virus reference department (VRD). Treating Bornholm disease There's no specific treatment for Bornholm disease. The infection usually clears up by itself after about a week. As the condition is caused by a viral infection, it can't be treated with antibiotics. Over-the-counter painkillers such as aspirin shouldn't be given to children under the age of 16. The main symptom of Bornholm disease is severe stabbing chest pain  Who's at risk of Bornholm disease? Bornholm disease mainly affects children and young adults under the age of 30. It usually occurs in epidemics in environments such as schools or nurseries, and more often during the summer and autumn.

Buying bottle feeding equipment You will need a number of bottles and teats, as well as sterilising equipment. There's no evidence that one type of teat or bottle is better than any other. But some feeding bottles have shapes or patterns that make them difficult to clean thoroughly. As hygiene is so important, simple bottles that are easy to wash and sterilise are probably best. Preparing bottle feeds Make sure your bottles and teats are sterilised. If you're using infant formula, pay close attention to the instructions on the packet when you make up the feed. How to bottle feed your baby Make sure you are sitting comfortably. Enjoy holding your baby and looking into their eyes as you feed them. Bottle feeding is a chance to feel close to your baby and get to know them. Hold your baby fairly upright for bottle feeds. Support their head so they can breathe and swallow comfortably. Brush the teat against your baby's lips and, when your they open their mouth wide, let them draw in the teat.   Always give your baby plenty of time to feed. Keep the teat full When bottle feeding, keep the teat full of milk, otherwise your baby will take in air. If the teat becomes flattened while you're feeding, gently poke a clean finger into the corner of your baby's mouth to release the suction. If the teat gets blocked, replace it with another sterile teat. Winding your baby Your baby may need short breaks during the feed and may need to burp sometimes. When your baby does not want any more feed, hold them upright and gently rub or pat their back to bring up any wind. This may only be a small amount. Throw away unused formula Don't forget to throw away any unused formula or breast milk after you have finished feeding your baby. Go with the flow Babies differ in how often they want to feed and how much milk they want to take. Feed your baby when they're hungry, and don't try to force them to finish a bottle. Don't leave your baby Never leave a baby alone to feed with a propped-up bottle as they may choke on the milk. Help with bottle feeding Talk to your midwife, health visitor or other mothers with experience of bottle feeding if you need help. You'll find the phone number for your health visitor in your baby's red book.  Common questions about bottle feeding Why doesn't my baby settle after a feed? If your baby swallows air while bottle feeding and is then put down to sleep, they may feel uncomfortable and cry. After a feed, it's usually helpful to hold your baby upright against your shoulder or propped forward on your lap. Gently rub their back so any trapped air can find its way out easily. But there's no need to overdo it \u2013 wind is not as big a problem as many people think. Why does my baby sometimes vomit after a feed? Some babies bring up more milk than others during or just after a feed. This is sometimes called possetting, regurgitation or reflux. Keep a muslin square handy just in case. It can be upsetting when this happens, and you may be worried that something is wrong. If it happens often, or your baby is violently sick, appears to be in pain or you're worried for any other reason, talk to your health visitor or GP. Check that the hole in your baby's teat is not too big \u2013 giving milk too quickly can cause sickness. Sitting your baby upright on your lap after a feed may help. If your baby brings up a lot of milk, they may be hungry again quite quickly. Don't force them to take more milk than they want during a feed. Every baby is different. Some prefer to feed little and often. Could formula feeding make my baby constipated? When using infant formula, always use the recommended amount of infant formula powder stated on the packet. Don't add extra infant formula because using too much can make your baby constipated and may cause dehydration. If your baby is under eight weeks old and hasn't passed a stool (had a poo) for two to three days, discuss this with your midwife, health visitor or GP, particularly if your baby is gaining weight slowly. Your baby should be gaining weight and have wet and dirty nappies. Infant formula and allergies If you think your baby might be allergic to or intolerant of infant formula, talk to your GP. If necessary, they can prescribe special formula feeds called extensively hydrolysed protein feeds. Some infant formula is labelled as hypoallergenic, but these are not suitable for babies with a diagnosed cows' milk allergy. Always talk to your GP before using hypoallergenic or soya-based infant formula, as babies who are allergic to cows' milk may also be allergic to soya.

The medical name for pain in and around the anus or rectum (back passage) is proctalgia. This pages covers: Common causes of anal pain Less common causes of anal pain When to get medical advice Common causes of anal pain Anal fissures An anal fissure is a small tear in the skin of the anus that can be caused by passing a large or hard poo. Symptoms of an anal fissure can include: a severe, sharp pain when doing a poo a burning or gnawing pain that lasts several hours after doing a poo rectal bleeding \u2013 you may notice a small amount of blood on the toilet paper after you wipe Anal fissures can be very painful, but many heal on their own in a few weeks. Increasing the amount of fibre in your diet, drinking plenty of fluids and taking laxatives and over-the-counter painkillers can help. If the pain persists, you may need special ointment that relaxes the ring of muscle around your anus. Occasionally, surgery may be needed to help the fissure heal. Read more about treatments for anal fissures. Haemorrhoids (piles) Haemorrhoids (piles) are swellings containing enlarged blood vessels that are found inside or around the bottom. They're often thought to be caused by straining on the toilet as a result of prolonged constipation. In many cases, haemorrhoids don't cause symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they may include: bleeding after doing a poo an itchy bottom feeling like there's a lump in or around your anus soreness and redness around your anus anal pain, if the blood supply to the haemorrhoid becomes blocked or interrupted \u2013 for example, by a blood clot The symptoms often pass after a few days. Increasing the amount of fibre in your diet, drinking plenty of fluids and taking laxatives and over-the-counter painkillers can help. If the blood supply to the haemorrhoid has been blocked by a clot, a simple procedure can be carried out to remove the clot under local anaesthetic (where the area is numbed). Read more about treatments for haemorrhoids.  Anal fistulas and abscesses An anal fistula is a small tunnel that develops between the end of the bowel and the skin near the anus. It's usually caused by an infection near the anus resulting in a collection of pus (an abscess). Symptoms of an anal fistula or abscess can include: a constant, throbbing pain that may be worse when you sit down skin irritation around the anus passing pus or blood when you poo swelling and redness around your anus a high temperature (fever) Your GP may prescribe antibiotics if an abscess is picked up early on. If it persists, it may need to be drained in hospital, possibly under general anaesthetic (while you're asleep). If a fistula develops, surgery will usually be needed because they rarely heal by themselves. Read more about treatments for anal fistulas. Less common causes of anal pain Less common causes of anal pain include: proctalgia fugax \u2013 a condition that causes episodes of sudden, severe anal pain that last for a few minutes at a time; medication that relaxes the muscles in the pelvis may help levator ani syndrome \u2013 an aching or pressure sensation in and around the anus that may be constant or last for hours or days at a time; treatment to relax the muscles in the pelvis may help an inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease \u2013 other symptoms can include tummy cramps, bloody diarrhoea and weight loss; treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms an infection \u2013 such as a fungal infection or rectal sexually transmitted infection (STI) a bone-related problem \u2013 such as coccydynia (tailbone pain) or pain that spreads from your lower back, pelvis or hips, caused by arthritis or bone tumours a urinary tract problem \u2013 such as prostatitis (inflammation or infection of the prostate gland) cancer of the anus or lower rectum \u2013 this can have similar symptoms of haemorrhoids and anal fissures, but is much rarer  When to get medical advice Many common causes of anal pain will improve with simple self-care treatments, so you don't always need to see your GP. But it's a good idea to see your GP if: your pain is severe your pain doesn't improve after a few days you also experience rectal bleeding Don't feel embarrassed to see your GP \u2013 anal pain is a common problem that they're used to seeing. Your GP can try to work out what the problem is and give you treatment advice. They'll probably ask to see your bottom and may carry out a rectal examination (where they gently insert a gloved finger into your bottom) to check for any abnormalities. If the cause is not immediately obvious, they may refer you to a specialist for advice and further tests.

This makes lines and wrinkles, such as crow's feet and frown lines, less obvious. They can temporarily alter your appearance without the need for surgery. When Botox or Dysport injections are used in this way for cosmetic reasons, they are not available on the NHS. Before you go ahead If you're considering Botox or Dysport injections, be certain about why you want to have them. The injections are expensive, and have their limitations. Cost: In the UK, botulinum toxin injections cost £150-£350 per session, depending on the amount of product used. Limitations: The effect isn't permanent. There's no guarantee the desired effect will be achieved. The ageing process will still happen elsewhere \u2013 for example, Botox will not fix sagging eyelids. Safety: Take time to find a reputable practitioner who is properly qualified and practises in a clean, safe and appropriate environment. Ask the practitioner what you should do if something were to go wrong. Botulinum toxin is a prescription-only medicine that should only be prescribed and given by an appropriately trained healthcare professional, such as a doctor, dentist, pharmacist prescriber, or nurse prescriber. Legally, the prescriber can delegate the administration of the injections to another person, but they are responsible for ensuring it is given safely. You shouldn't have botulinum injections if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, since the effects on the baby aren't known. What it involves You'll need to first meet with the doctor, nurse prescriber, pharmacist prescriber or dentist who will prescribe the medicine. This should always be a face-to-face meeting.  They'll want to fully understand your medical history and reasons for wanting the treatment before they go ahead. The person who prescribed the medicine might administer it, or they might delegate this task to another person. Local anaesthetic isn't usually needed. Your skin is cleaned and small amounts of botulinum toxin are injected into the muscles of the face to be treated. Several injections are usually needed at different sites. It takes about 10 minutes. The injections may be a little painful. Most people tolerate the discomfort well. Afterwards You won't see any difference straight away: it takes about three to five days before the injections take effect, and up to two weeks for the full effect to be seen. Avoid massaging or rubbing the treated areas for up to three days. The effects generally last for about four to six months. If you want to maintain the effect, you'll need regular follow-up injections. Risks The risks of treatment include: flu-like symptoms \u2013 including a headache \u2013 for the first 24 hours after treatment bruising at the injection site temporary weakness and droopiness of your facial features \u2013 for example, eyelids or eyebrows may droop temporarily if the injected medicine moves into these areas  your body developing resistance to the treatment if it's repeated too frequently In rare cases, serious problems can develop in the hours, days or weeks after treatment, including blurred or double vision (if the area around the eyes is injected) and breathing difficulties (if the neck area is injected). What to do if you have problems If you've had Botox injections and are not happy with the results or are experiencing problems, take up the matter with your practitioner through the clinic where you were treated. If there are any complications that require medical attention, it is best that you go back to the practitioner who treated you. If this is not possible, you can go to your GP or local accident and emergency (A&E) department. You can also report any side effects directly through the Yellow Card Scheme website. By reporting side effects, you are helping to provide more information on the safety of this medicine.

These toxins are some of the most powerful known to science. They attack the nervous system (nerves, brain and spinal cord) and cause paralysis (muscle weakness). Most people will make a full recovery with treatment, but the paralysis can spread to the muscles that control breathing if it's not treated quickly. This is fatal in around 5-10% of cases. This page covers: Symptoms of botulism When to get medical advice Causes and types of botulism Treatment for botulism Preventing botulism Symptoms of botulism The time it takes to develop symptoms can vary from a few hours to several days after exposure to the Clostridium botulinum bacteria or their toxins. Depending on the exact type of the condition (see Causes and types of botulism below), some people initially have symptoms such as feeling sick, vomiting, stomach cramps, diarrhoea or constipation. Without treatment, botulism eventually causes paralysis that spreads down the body from the head to the legs. Symptoms can include: drooping eyelids blurred or double vision facial muscle weakness difficulty swallowing slurred speech breathing difficulties Affected babies may also have a weak cry, find it difficult to feed and have a floppy head, neck and limbs. When to get medical advice Botulism is a very serious condition that requires immediate medical attention. Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department or dial 999 for an ambulance straight away if you or someone you know has symptoms of the condition. Treatment is more effective the earlier it's started. Causes and types of botulism Clostridium botulinum bacteria are found in soil, dust, and river or sea sediments. The bacteria themselves aren't harmful, but they can produce highly poisonous toxins when deprived of oxygen \u2013 such as in closed cans or bottles, stagnant soil or mud, or occasionally the human body. There are three main types of botulism: food-borne botulism \u2013 when someone eats food containing the toxins because it hasn't been properly canned, preserved or cooked wound botulism \u2013 when a wound becomes infected with the bacteria, usually as a result of injecting illegal drugs contaminated with the bacteria, such as heroin, into muscle rather than a vein infant botulism \u2013 when a baby swallows a resistant form of the bacteria, called a spore, in contaminated soil or food, such as honey. These spores are harmless to older children and adults because the body develops defences against them from about one year of age All these types of botulism are very rare in the UK, but occasional cases do occur. Treatment for botulism Botulism needs to be treated in hospital. The way it's treated depends on which type of botulism you have, but treatment will usually involve: neutralising the toxins with injections of special antitoxins or antibodies supporting the functions of the body, such as breathing, until you recover Treatment won't reverse any paralysis that's already been caused by the toxin, but it will stop it getting any worse. In most people, paralysis that occurred before treatment will gradually improve over the following weeks or months. Preventing botulism As a result of high standards of food hygiene in the UK, the chances of getting food-borne botulism from food bought in this country are tiny. There's a slightly higher risk if you produce your own food, particularly if this involves canning. However, following food hygiene procedures and canning recommendations will reduce any risk. You should also avoid eating food from visibly bulging or damaged cans, foul-smelling preserved foods, foods stored at the incorrect temperature and out of date foods. Heroin users should avoid injecting heroin into their muscles. Injecting heroin into a vein or smoking it can reduce the risk of botulism, although not using heroin at all is by far the best course of action. Read more about getting help to stop using heroin. The specific cause is not identified in many cases of infant botulism, so it may not always be possible to prevent it. However, you should avoid giving honey to babies less than 12 months old because it has been known to contain Clostridium botulinum spores.  Page last reviewed: 18\/02\/2016 Next review due: 18\/02\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's not usually serious and most people get better within a few days without treatment. In most cases of food poisoning, the food is contaminated by bacteria, such as salmonella or Escherichia coli (E. coli), or a virus, such as the norovirus. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of food poisoning usually begin within one to two days of eating contaminated food, although they may start at any point between a few hours and several weeks later. The main symptoms include: feeling sick (nausea) vomiting diarrhoea, which may contain blood or mucus stomach cramps and abdominal (tummy) pain a lack of energy and weakness loss of appetite a high temperature (fever) aching muscles chills In most cases, these symptoms will pass in a few days and you will make a full recovery. What to do Most people with food poisoning recover at home and don't need any specific treatment, although there are some situations where you should see your GP for advice (see below). Until you feel better, you should rest and drink fluids to prevent dehydration. Try to drink plenty of water, even if you can only sip it. Eat when you feel up to it, but try small, light meals at first and stick to bland foods \u2013 such as toast, crackers, bananas and rice \u2013 until you begin to feel better. Oral rehydration solutions (ORS), which are available from pharmacies, are recommended for more vulnerable people, such as the elderly and those with another health condition. Read more about treating food poisoning. When to see your GP You should contact your GP if: your symptoms are severe \u2013 for example, if you're unable to keep down any fluids because you are vomiting repeatedly your symptoms don't start to improve after a few days you have symptoms of severe dehydration, such as confusion, a rapid heartbeat, sunken eyes and passing little or no urine you're pregnant you're over 60 your baby or young child has suspected food poisoning you have a long-term underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), heart valve disease, diabetes or kidney disease you have a weak immune system \u2013 for example, because of medication, cancer treatment or HIV In these situations, your GP may send off a stool sample for analysis and prescribe antibiotics, or they may refer you to hospital so you can be looked after more closely. How is food contaminated? Food can become contaminated at any stage during production, processing or cooking. For example, it can be contaminated by: not cooking food thoroughly (particularly meat) not correctly storing food that needs to be chilled at below 5C leaving cooked food for too long at warm temperatures not sufficiently reheating previously cooked food someone who is ill or who has dirty hands touching the food eating food that has passed its \"use by\" date the spread of bacteria between contaminated foods (cross-contamination) Foods particularly susceptible to contamination if not handled, stored or cooked properly include: raw meat and poultry raw eggs raw shellfish unpasteurised milk \"ready-to-eat\" foods, such as cooked sliced meats, pâté, soft cheeses and pre-packed sandwiches Read more about the causes of food poisoning and preventing food poisoning.

Depending on where the cancer starts, bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer. Cancer can sometimes start in the small bowel (small intestine), but small bowel cancer is much rarer than large bowel cancer. Bowel cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed in the UK, with around 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. About 1 in every 20 people in the UK will develop bowel cancer in their lifetime. Signs and symptoms The three main symptoms of bowel cancer are blood in the stools (faeces), changes in bowel habit \u2013 such as more frequent, looser stools \u2013 and abdominal (tummy) pain. However, these symptoms are very common and most people with them do not have bowel cancer. For example, blood in the stools is more often caused by haemorrhoids (piles), and a change in bowel habit or abdominal pain is usually the result of something you have eaten. As almost 9 out of 10 people with bowel cancer are over the age of 60, these symptoms are more important as people get older. They are also more significant when they persist despite simple treatments. Most people who are eventually diagnosed with bowel cancer have one of the following combination of symptoms: a persistent change in bowel habit that causes them to go to the toilet more often and pass looser stools, usually together with blood on or in their stools a persistent change in bowel habit without blood in their stools, but with abdominal pain blood in the stools without other haemorrhoid symptoms, such as soreness, discomfort, pain, itching or a lump hanging down outside the back passage abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always provoked by eating, sometimes resulting in a reduction in the amount of food eaten and weight loss The symptoms of bowel cancer can be subtle and don't necessarily make you feel ill. Read more about the symptoms of bowel cancer. When to seek medical advice Try the bowel cancer symptom checker for advice on treatments you can try to see if your symptoms get better, and when you should see your GP to discuss whether any tests are necessary. Your doctor will probably carry out a simple examination of your tummy and bottom to make sure you have no lumps. They may also arrange for a simple blood test to check for iron deficiency anaemia \u2013 this can indicate whether there is any bleeding from your bowel that you haven't been aware of. In some cases, your doctor may decide it is best for you to have a simple test in hospital to make sure there is no serious cause for your symptoms. Make sure you return to your doctor if your symptoms persist or keep coming back after stopping treatment, regardless of their severity or your age. Read more about diagnosing bowel cancer. Who's at risk? It's not known exactly what causes bowel cancer, but there are a number of things that can increase your risk. These include: age \u2013 almost 9 in 10 cases of bowel cancer occur in people aged 60 or over diet \u2013 a diet high in red or processed meats and low in fibre can increase your risk weight \u2013 bowel cancer is more common in people who are overweight or obese exercise \u2013 being inactive increases the risk of getting bowel cancer alcohol and smoking \u2013 a high alcohol intake and smoking may increase your chances of getting bowel cancer family history \u2013 having a close relative (mother or father, brother or sister) who developed bowel cancer under the age of 50 puts you at a greater lifetime risk of developing the condition Some people have an increased risk of bowel cancer because they have another condition that affects their bowel, such as severe ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, over a long period of time. Read more about the causes of bowel cancer and preventing bowel cancer. Bowel cancer screening To detect cases of bowel cancer sooner, the NHS offers two types of bowel cancer screening to adults registered with a GP in England: faecal occult blood (FOB) test \u2013 all men and women aged 60 to 74 are invited to carry out an FOB test at home. They're sent the home test kit every two years through the post until they reach the age of 74. The FOB test checks for the presence of blood in a stool sample, which could be an early sign of bowel cancer. bowel scope screening \u2013 this additional one-off test is being gradually introduced in England. It is offered to men and women at the age of 55. As of March 2015, about two-thirds of screening centres were beginning to offer this test to 55-year-olds. It involves a doctor or nurse using a thin, flexible instrument to look inside the lower part of the bowel and remove any small growths called polyps, which could eventually turn into cancer. Screening plays an important part in the fight against bowel cancer as it can help detect bowel cancer before it causes obvious symptoms, which increases the chances of people surviving the condition. Read more about screening for bowel cancer. Treatment and outlook Bowel cancer can be treated using a combination of different treatments, depending on where the cancer is in your bowel and how far it has spread. The main treatments are: surgery \u2013 the cancerous section of bowel is removed; it is the most effective way of curing bowel cancer, and is all that many people need chemotherapy \u2013 where medication is used to kill cancer cells  radiotherapy \u2013 where radiation is used to kill cancer cells biological treatments \u2013 a newer type of medication that increases the effectiveness of chemotherapy and prevents the cancer spreading As with most types of cancer, the chances of a complete cure depends on how far it has advanced by the time it is diagnosed. If the cancer is confined to the bowel, surgery will usually be able to completely remove it. Overall, 7 to 8 in every 10 people with bowel cancer will live at least one year after diagnosis. More than half of those diagnosed will live at least another 10 years. Every year, around 16,000 people die as a result of bowel cancer. Read more about how bowel cancer is treated and living with bowel cancer. How well your local NHS performs Clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) are NHS bodies that organise the delivery of NHS services in England. They play a major role in achieving good health outcomes for the local population they serve. You can now check how your local CCG compares against others for bowel cancer survival (PDF, 900kb).

If it's detected at an early stage, before symptoms appear, it's easier to treat and there's a better chance of surviving it. To detect cases of bowel cancer sooner, the NHS offers two types of bowel cancer screening to adults registered with a GP in England: All men and women aged 60-74 are invited to carry out a faecal occult blood (FOB) test. Every two years, they're sent a home test kit, which is used to collect a stool sample. If you are 75 or over, you can ask for this test by calling the freephone helpline on 0800 707 60 60. An additional one-off test called bowel scope screening is gradually being introduced in England. This is offered to men and women at the age of 55. As of March 2015, about two-thirds of screening centres were beginning to offer this test to 55-year-olds. It involves a doctor or nurse using a thin, flexible instrument to look inside the lower part of the bowel.  Taking part in bowel cancer screening reduces your chances of dying from bowel cancer, and removing polyps in bowel scope screening can prevent cancer. However, all screening involves a balance of potential harms, as well as benefits. It's up to you to decide if you want to have it. To help you decide, read on to learn about what the two tests involve, what the different possible results mean, and the potential risks for you to weigh up. What does the FOB screening test involve? The home testing kit is used to collect tiny stool samples on a special card. The card is then sealed in a hygienic freepost envelope and sent to the screening laboratory, where it will be checked for traces of blood that may not be visible to the naked eye, but could be an early sign of bowel cancer. For more information, read what the FOB screening test involves. Your results You'll receive the results of your FOB test within two weeks of sending in the test kit. There are three types of result: Most people will have a normal result \u2013 no further tests are needed and you'll be invited to take part in screening again in two years (if you're still aged 60-74). A few people will have an unclear result \u2013 you'll be asked to repeat the FOB test up to twice more. A few people will have an abnormal result \u2013 you'll be offered an appointment to discuss colonoscopy at a local screening centre. Read more about FOB test results. If you're outside the age range... People aged 75 and older can still be screened for bowel cancer. They can request an FOB screening kit by calling the freephone helpline on 0800 707 60 60. People younger than 60 are not eligible for the FOB screening test, but can have bowel scope screening (see below). If you have symptoms, are worried about a family history of bowel cancer, or are worried about your bowel health in any way, speak to your GP. What does bowel scope screening involve? Bowel scope screening is done by a specially trained nurse or doctor at an NHS bowel cancer screening centre. The doctor or nurse will put a thin flexible tube into your bottom to look inside the lower part of your bowel and remove any small growths, called polyps, that could eventually turn into cancer. Read more about bowel scope screening. Your results You'll receive the results of your bowel scope screening test within two weeks of your appointment.  Most people will have a normal result. Some people will have polyps, which may mean having another examination of the bowel (a colonoscopy). Rarely, the test will find cancer. Read more about bowel scope screening results. What are the risks? No screening test is 100% reliable. There's a chance a cancer can be missed if it was not bleeding when the screening test was taken. This means you might be falsely reassured. Bowel scope screening is usually safe, but in rare cases it can cause harm to the bowel. Learn more about the risks of bowel scope screening. If you get an abnormal result, you'll be offered a colonoscopy. Although rare, there are risks associated with having this investigation. Most people who have a colonoscopy will not have cancer.

Polyps are usually less than 1cm in size, although they can grow up to several centimetres. There are various forms: some are a tiny raised area or bulge, known as a sessile polyp some look like a grape on a stalk, known as a pedunculated polyp some take the form of many tiny bumps clustered together Bowel polyps are not usually cancerous, although if they're discovered they'll need to be removed, as some will eventually turn into cancer if left untreated. Some people just develop one polyp, while others may have a few. They tend to occur in people over the age of 60. How are they caused? Bowel polyps are caused by an abnormal production of cells. The lining of the bowel constantly renews itself, and a faulty gene can cause the cells in the bowel lining to grow more quickly. There may be a family tendency towards developing bowel polyps or bowel cancer. What are the symptoms? Most people with polyps won't be aware of them as they produce no symptoms and are often discovered by accident. However, some larger polyps can cause: a small amount of rectal bleeding (blood in your stool) mucus to be produced when you open your bowels diarrhoea or constipation abdominal pain How are they discovered? Bowel polyps are usually found as a result of a bowel investigation for another reason, such as a sigmoidoscopy (examination of the last part of the bowel) or during screening for bowel cancer. If polyps are found, a colonoscopy or CT colonography is needed to view the whole of the large bowel and remove any polyps. How are they treated? There are several methods for treating polyps, but the most common procedure involves snaring the polyp during a colonoscopy. Snaring is like cutting the polyp off with cheese wire and is painless. Both of the above methods involve passing a flexible instrument called a colonoscope through your bottom and up into your bowel. The colonoscope has a wire with an electric current to either cauterise (burn off) or snare the polyp. In rare cases, polyps may need to be treated by surgically removing part of the bowel. This is usually only done when the polyp has some cell changes or is particularly large. After the polyp or polyps have been removed, they are sent to specialists in a laboratory, who will inform your consultant if: the polyp has been completely removed there is any risk of it regrowing there is any cancerous change in the polyp If there is a cancerous change in the polyp, you may need further treatment (depending on the degree and extent of change). Your specialist will be able to advise you on this. Outlook Some people will need further colonoscopies because polyps can recur. Polyps can sometimes run in families. This is uncommon, but means you'll need colonoscopy checks at regular intervals. You might be asked to have repeat examinations at intervals of around three to five years to catch any further polyps that may develop and potentially turn into bowel cancer. A polyp in the colon (large bowel)  Bowel cancer risk Polyps are not usually cancerous. But if some types of polyps are not removed, they may eventually become cancerous. This takes many years to happen, however. About 1 in 10 polyps will turn into cancer. These are called adenomas. Most doctors think all bowel cancers develop from polyps.

It is a complicated and highly specialised operation that is not commonly performed, although the number of procedures carried out has increased in recent years. Currently, around 15-20 small bowel transplants are performed each year in the UK. These procedures are carried out at four specialist centres \u2013 Birmingham Children\u2019s Hospital, Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital in Cambridge, John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford and King's College Hospital in London. Why small bowel transplants are carried out A small bowel transplant is an option for children and adults whose bowel has stopped working properly and who are being fed by total parenteral nutrition (TPN). This is where a person requires all their nutrition to be given through a drip into a vein because their bowel is unable to absorb nutrients from any food they eat. While many people needing TPN can have this treatment at home without experiencing any significant problems, the long-term use of TPN can lead to serious complications such as liver disease and repeated infections. A small bowel transplant may be considered when the person has a serious problem with their bowel, but has developed complications from TPN or is unable to tolerate this form of feeding. Read more about when a small bowel transplant is needed. Getting ready Before having a small bowel transplant, you will need a transplant assessment. This involves tests and conversations with a transplant team to check if you are suitable for the procedure. If you are suitable, you will be placed on a national waiting list until suitable organs from a recently deceased donor become available. You may be contacted at any time by the transplant team, day or night. How long you have to wait will depend on your blood group, the availability of donors and how many urgent cases are on the list. On average, people wait just under six months for a small bowel transplant. In some cases, it may be possible for a family member to donate a section of their bowel for transplantation, without you needing to be placed on the waiting list. Read more about preparing for a small bowel transplant. The operation A small bowel transplant is a complicated and difficult operation that takes, on average, around 8-10 hours and is carried out under general anaesthetic. During the procedure, the surgeon will remove the bowel and connect the transplanted bowel to your blood vessels and digestive tract. They will also form an ileostomy, where part of the small bowel is diverted through an opening in the tummy, called a stoma. The stoma will allow digestive waste to pass out of your body into an external pouch, and lets the transplant team easily assess the health of your transplanted bowel. Although it is not always possible, the ileostomy may be reversed a few months later. Read more about how a small bowel transplant is performed. After the operation Recovering from a small bowel transplant can take a long time, and you'll probably need to stay in hospital for at least four to six weeks. While in hospital, you will receive medication to reduce the risk of your body rejecting the new organ; these are known as immunosuppressants. You will be slowly weaned from TPN to eating a normal diet. After leaving hospital, you'll need to continue taking immunosuppressant medication and have regular check-ups for the rest of your life. Read more about recovering from a small bowel transplant. Outlook Although medication and regular check-ups will be needed indefinitely, a small bowel transplant can allow you to live as normal a life as possible \u2013 including working, enjoying hobbies and living independently. However, due to the risks of surgery and the general poor health of people who are considered for a small bowel transplant, some people will die within a few years of their operation. Current figures for transplants carried out in the UK between January 1998 and December 2013 show that: after 90 days \u2013 84% of adults and 88% of children are still alive after one year \u2013 76% of adults and 72% of children are still alive after five years \u2013 62% of adults and 51% of children are still alive However, the outlook for small bowel transplants carried out now is likely to be better than these figures suggest, as medical knowledge and techniques are constantly improving.

Proponents of \"leaky gut syndrome\" claim that many symptoms and conditions are caused by the immune system reacting to germs, toxins or other substances that have been absorbed into the bloodstream via a porous (\"leaky\") bowel. While it's true that some conditions and medications can cause a \"leaky\" gut (what scientists call increased intestinal permeability), there is currently little evidence to support the theory that a porous bowel is the direct cause of any significant, widespread problems. There is also little evidence that the \"treatments\" some people claim help to reduce bowel \"leakiness\", such as nutritional supplements and herbal remedies, have any beneficial effect for most of the conditions they supposedly help. What can cause a \"leaky\" bowel? The inside of the bowel is lined by a single layer of cells that make up the mucosal barrier (the barrier between the inside of the gut and the rest of the body). This barrier is effective at absorbing nutrients, but prevents most large molecules and germs passing from inside the bowel into the bloodstream and potentially causing widespread symptoms. In some circumstances, this barrier can become less effective and \"leaky\", although this in itself is not generally thought to be sufficient to cause serious problems. Alcohol and certain painkillers Alcohol, aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen are well-known irritants of the bowel lining. They can damage the seals between cells, allowing some substances to pass through the gaps and into the bloodstream. Gastroenterologists (specialists in gut conditions) generally agree that these irritants don't usually cause anything more than just mild inflammation of a particular area of the bowel. This will usually cause no obvious symptoms and will improve over time if you stop taking the medication or stop drinking alcohol. At the very worst, the inflammation might be bad enough to occasionally cause ulcers in the bowel lining. Certain conditions and treatments The following conditions and treatments can also damage the seals in the bowel lining: inflammatory bowel diseases \u2013 such as Crohn's disease infections of the intestines \u2013 such as salmonella, norovirus and giardiasis  coeliac disease  chemotherapy medicines chronic kidney disease   radiotherapy to the abdomen (tummy) immunosuppressants (medicines that weaken the immune system) HIV\/AIDS  cystic fibrosis   type 1 diabetes sepsis complicated surgery Generally, even in these situations treatment for a \"leaky\" bowel isn\u2019t necessary. However, under certain circumstances people with Crohn's disease, for example, may benefit from a liquid diet to reduce bowel inflammation, which also improves the \u201Cleaky\u201D bowel (read more about treating Crohn's disease). The \"leaky gut syndrome\" theory Exponents of \"leaky gut syndrome\" \u2013 largely nutritionists and practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine \u2013 believe the bowel lining can become irritated and \"leaky\" as the result of a much wider range of factors, including an overgrowth of yeast or bacteria in the bowel, a poor diet and the overuse of antibiotics. They believe that undigested food particles, bacterial toxins and germs can pass through the \"leaky\" gut wall and into the bloodstream, triggering the immune system and causing persistent inflammation throughout the body. This, they say, is linked to a much wider range of health problems, including: food allergies  migraine  tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome   asthma  lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis (MS) skin conditions such as scleroderma and eczema autism  However, there is currently little evidence to suggest these conditions are in fact caused by having a \"leaky\" gut. Promoted products Many different \"treatments\" have been suggested by people who promote the idea of \"leaky gut syndrome\", including diet books, nutritional supplements (containing probiotics, for example), herbal remedies, gluten-free foods and other special diets, such as a low FODMAP, low sugar or antifungal diet. However, you should be wary of treatments offered by people who claim to be able to \"cure\" \"leaky gut syndrome\", as there is little scientific evidence to suggest they are beneficial for many of the conditions they are claimed to help. Some people even promote various nutritional \"treatments\" for autism, despite conflicting evidence and a recommendation from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) that special diets shouldn't be used to treat the main symptoms of the condition. Some of the dietary changes suggested for \u201Cleaky gut syndrome\u201D (such as a low FODMAP diet) can help people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but these seem to work irrespective of the presence of a \u201Cleaky\u201D gut. Generally, eliminating foods from the diet is not a good idea unless it's strictly necessary (for example, if you have coeliac disease) and done on the advice of a healthcare professional, as it can lead to nutritional deficiencies.  Advice and further information If you have symptoms that are not explained by a diagnosis, it may help to read the topic on medically unexplained symptoms. Such mystery symptoms are surprisingly common, accounting for up to a fifth of all GP consultations in the UK.  If you have been diagnosed with a particular health condition, you can look it up in our A-Z index of treatments and conditions, where you will find reliable, evidence-based information about its treatment. Generally, it is wise to view \"holistic\" and \"natural health\" websites with scepticism \u2013 do not assume that the information they provide is correct or based on scientific facts or evidence.

The main sign is a red, scaly patch on the skin. It affects the squamous cells \u2013 in the outermost layer of skin \u2013 and is sometimes referred to as \"squamous cell carcinoma in situ\". The patch is usually very slow-growing, but if left untreated there's a small chance it could turn into a more serious type of skin cancer. This page covers: Is it serious? Symptoms When to get medical advice Causes Treatments Looking after your skin Is Bowen's disease serious? Bowen's disease itself isn't usually serious. It tends to grow very slowly over months or years and there are several very effective treatments for it (see below). The concern is that Bowen's disease can eventually develop into a different type of skin cancer called squamous cell skin cancer if it's left undiagnosed or neglected. It's estimated that this happens in up to 1 in 20 to 1 in 30 people with untreated Bowen's disease. Squamous cell skin cancer is often treatable, but it can spread deeper into the body and is sometimes very serious. Symptoms of Bowen's disease Bowen's disease usually appears as a patch on the skin that has clear edges and doesn't heal. Some people have more than one patch. The patch may be: red or pink scaly or crusty flat or raised up to a few centimetres across itchy (but isn't always) The patch can appear anywhere on the skin, but is especially common on exposed areas such as the lower legs, neck and head. Sometimes they can affect the groin area and, in men, the penis. If the patch bleeds, starts to turn into an open sore (ulcer), or develops a lump, it could be a sign that it has turned into squamous cell skin cancer. When to get medical advice See your GP if you have a persistent red, scaly patch of skin and don't know the cause. It's important to get a proper diagnosis, as Bowen's disease can look like other conditions, such as psoriasis or eczema. If necessary, your GP will refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) to determine what the problem is. If they're not sure about the cause, they may need to remove a small sample of skin so it can be looked at more closely (called a biopsy). Causes of Bowen's disease Bowen's disease usually affects older people in their 60s and 70s. The exact cause is unclear, but it has been closely linked with: long-term exposure to the sun or use of sunbeds \u2013 especially in people with fair skin having a weak immune system \u2013 for example, it's more common in people taking medication to suppress their immune system after an organ transplant or those with AIDS previous radiotherapy treatment the human papillomavirus (HPV) \u2013 a common virus that often affects the genital area and can cause genital warts Bowen's disease doesn't run in families and you can't pass it on to others. Treatments for Bowen's disease There are a number of treatment options for Bowen's disease. Talk to your dermatologist about which treatment is most suitable for you. The main treatments are: Cryotherapy \u2013 Liquid nitrogen is sprayed onto the affected skin to freeze it. The procedure may be painful and the skin may remain a bit uncomfortable for a few days. The affected skin will scab over and fall off within a few weeks. Imiquimod cream or chemotherapy cream (such as 5-fluorouracil) \u2013 This is applied to the affected skin regularly for a few weeks. It may cause your skin to become red and inflamed before it gets better. Curettage and cautery \u2013 The affected area of skin is scraped away under local anaesthetic (the skin is numbed), and heat or electricity is used to stop any bleeding, leaving the area to scab over and heal after a few weeks. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) \u2013 A light-sensitive cream is applied to the affected skin, and a laser is directed onto the skin a few hours later, to destroy the abnormal cells. The treatment session lasts about 20-45 minutes. You may need more than one session. Surgery \u2013 The abnormal skin is cut out under local anaesthetic and stitches may be needed afterwards. In a few cases, your dermatologist may just advise monitoring your skin closely \u2013 for example, if it's very slow-growing and they feel the side effects of treatment will outweigh the benefits. Looking after your skin after treatment After treatment, you may need follow-up appointments with your dermatologist or GP to see if you need any further treatment. If you had surgery, you may need to have any stitches removed at your GP surgery a week or two later. After treatment: see your GP if an existing patch starts to bleed, change in appearance or develops a lump \u2013 don't wait for your follow-up appointment see your GP if you notice any worrying new patches on your skin make sure you protect your skin from the sun \u2013 wear protective clothing and use a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 Read more advice on staying safe in the sun.

Orthodontic treatment can straighten the teeth and move them into a better position.   Healthcare professionals specialising in orthodontics are known as orthodontists. You can find a list of all specialist orthodontists registered in the UK on the General Dental Council (GDC) website. What does orthodontic treatment involve? Orthodontics uses devices such as a brace to correct the position of the teeth. Your exact treatment will depend on the problems with your teeth. In some cases, you may have to wear headgear at night as well as a brace, and you may also need to have some teeth removed as part of your treatment. The length of treatment will depend on how complicated the problem is, but it's usually between 18 and 24 months.  Read more about the types of orthodontic treatment. Who needs orthodontic treatment? Many people have crowded or crooked teeth, or their teeth don't meet correctly when they bite. These problems can mean the teeth are more likely to become damaged or put a strain on jaw muscles.   In some cases, abnormal development of the teeth and jaw can affect the shape of the face. Problems with crooked and out-of-place teeth are quite common in the UK. It's thought around a third of 12-year-olds would benefit from some degree of orthodontic treatment. Read more about when orthodontic treatment is used. How can I access orthodontic treatment? In most cases, you or your child will be referred to an orthodontist by your dentist, although you may be able to seek treatment directly. If orthodontic treatment is recommended, you may have to decide whether to have treatment privately or on the NHS. NHS orthodontic treatment is free for people under the age of 18 with a clear clinical need for treatment. However, because of the high demand for treatment, there can be a long waiting list for NHS orthodontic treatment. If you don't qualify for free NHS treatment, or you don't want to wait for treatment to start, you may choose to have private treatment. Private treatment is widely available but can be expensive, with an average fee of between £2,000 and £6,000. Read more about accessing orthodontic treatment. Keeping your braces clean A common complication of orthodontics is tooth decay. Your mouth is full of bacteria that combine with small food particles and saliva to form a sticky film known as plaque. which leads to plaque and causes the enamel to decay. Many people with appliances find it difficult to keep their teeth clean, so additional brushing is essential during treatment. To reduce your risk of enamel decay, your orthodontist may recommend using toothpaste with high levels of fluoride or a mouthwash that contains fluoride. You should also try to avoid sugary foods and fizzy drinks. Read more about how to maintain good dental health.

You will only ever be asked to pay one charge for each complete course of treatment, even if you need to visit your dentist more than once to finish it. If you are referred to another dentist for another, separate course of treatment, you can expect a second charge. Some minor treatments are free.  NHS dental charges Band 1 course of treatment \u2013 £19.70 This covers examinations, diagnosis (including radiographs), advice on how to prevent future problems, scale and polish if clinically necessary, and preventative care (e.g. applications of fluoride varnish or fissure sealant). This band also covers emergency care in a primary care dental practice such as pain relief or a temporary filling. Band 2 course of treatment \u2013 £53.90 This covers everything listed in Band 1, plus any further treatment such as fillings, root canal work or if your dentist needs to take out one or more of your teeth. Band 3 course of treatment \u2013 £233.70 This covers everything listed in Bands 1 and 2, plus crowns, dentures, bridges and other laboratory work. Read the section Understanding NHS dental charges for more detailed information.   Who is entitled to free dental care? You do not have to pay for NHS dental treatment if, when the treatment starts, you are: aged under 18 under 19 and receiving full-time education pregnant or have had a baby in the previous 12 months staying in an NHS hospital and your treatment is carried out by the hospital dentist an NHS hospital dental service outpatient (however, you may have to pay for your dentures or bridges). You do not have to pay if, during the course of treatment, you or your partner, receive: Income Support Income-related Employment and Support Allowance Income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance Pension Credit guarantee credit Universal Credit and meet the criteria or you are named on or entitled to a valid NHS tax credit exemption certificate \u2013 if you don't have a certificate, you can show your award notice; you qualify if you get Child Tax Credits, Working Tax Credits with a disability element (or both) and have income for tax credit purposes of £15,276 or less you are named on a valid HC2 certificate Find out more about the NHS Low Income Scheme (LIS).   Partial help If your name is on a valid HC3 certificate, you may not have to pay for all your treatment. Checks are made on free and reduced cost treatment claims. If you say you have the right to free treatment when you do not, you may incur a penalty charge.  Note You will not be exempt from paying because you receive: Incapacity Benefit, contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance, contribution-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance, Disability Living Allowance, Council Tax Benefit, Housing Benefit or Pension Credit savings credit, when paid on their own. Medical conditions do not exempt patients from payment for dental treatment. You will be asked to show your dentist written proof that you do not have to pay for all or part of your NHS treatment. You will also be asked to sign a form to confirm that you do not have to pay. I am on a low income, how can I get help with NHS charges? If you are on a low income you may be eligible to receive financial help through the NHS Low Income Scheme. To apply for an HC2 certificate, you should complete form HC1, which is available from Jobcentre Plus offices or most NHS hospitals. Your doctor, dentist or optician may be able to give you one, too. You can also get an HC1 form by calling 0845 610 1112. Whether you qualify for help is based on a comparison between your weekly income and assessed requirements at the time the claim is made. For more information about requirements visit NHS: help with health costs. You will qualify for a full-help HC2 certificate (which includes free NHS prescriptions) if your income is less than or equal to your requirements, or your income is greater than your requirements by no more than half the current English prescription charge. You will qualify for a limited-help HC3 certificate if your income is greater than your requirements by more than half the current English prescription charge. The HC3 certificate shows how much you have to pay towards your health costs. Certificates are usually valid for periods of between six months and five years, depending on your circumstances. Find out more about the NHS Low Income Scheme (LIS). Exemption for pregnant women Pregnant women and those who have had a baby in the last 12 months get free NHS dental treatment. You may have to show proof such as a maternity exemption certificate (MatEx), a maternity certificate (MATB1) or your baby's birth certificate. However, if you have given birth more than 12 months ago you will not be entitled to free NHS dental treatment. Please note that your MatEx alone only gives exemption from NHS prescriptions. How do I claim for help with NHS dental charges? Tell your dental practice you want NHS treatment when you make an appointment, and fill out the form you are given when you arrive. If you do not have to pay, put a cross in the appropriate box. If you have a valid HC2 certificate or tax credit exemption certificate, write in the certificate number. If you have a valid HC3 certificate, write in the certificate number and the maximum your certificate says you can pay. You will pay either what appears on the certificate or the actual charge, whichever is the least. You will be asked to show proof of your entitlement to help with dental costs. If you are not sure you are entitled to help, then you must pay. You can claim a refund, but make sure you keep all receipts. How can I claim a refund? Ask your dentist for the NHS receipt form FP64 or a receipt that shows the amount of the NHS charge and the date you paid. If you are claiming on the grounds of low income, complete form HC5 (D): Refund of NHS dental charges  (PDF, 60kb). It tells you where to send the completed form. If you want to claim a refund for another reason, for example, because you are pregnant, have had a baby in the previous 12 months, are aged under 18 or 18 and in full-time education, you will need to explain why you are claiming a refund. Enclose your receipt and make sure you include your full name and the address of your dentist, and write to: NHS Business Services Authority NHS Dental Services PO Box 3181 St Annes Road Eastbourne BN21 9PQ Note: refunds of charges for private dental treatment or sundry items such as toothbrushes cannot be made. Where a course of treatment is a mixture of NHS and private treatment a refund of the NHS charge only can be made.

This is known as \"flat head syndrome\", and there are two main types: plagiocephaly \u2013 the head is flattened on one side, causing it to look asymmetrical; the ears may be misaligned and the head looks like a parallelogram when seen from above, and sometimes the forehead and face may bulge a little on the flat side brachycephaly \u2013 the back of the head becomes flattened, causing the head to widen, and occasionally the forehead bulges out These problems are quite common, affecting around one in every five babies at some point. In most cases they aren't a major cause for concern, as they don't have any effect on the brain and the head shape will often improve by itself over time. Your baby won't experience any pain or other symptoms, or any problems with their general development. This page covers: What causes plagiocephaly and brachycephaly When to get medical advice What you can do Helmets, headbands and mattresses Will my child's head shape return to normal? What causes plagiocephaly and brachycephaly? The skull consists of plates of bone that strengthen and join together as a child gets older. A young baby's skull is still relatively soft and can change shape if there's constant pressure on a particular part of their head. Reasons why this may happen include: sleeping on their back \u2013 the back or side of a baby's head can become flattened as a result of always sleeping on their back, but it's important they do this to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) problems in the womb \u2013 pressure can be placed on a baby's head before it's born if things are a bit squashed in the womb or there's a lack of amniotic fluid to cushion the baby being born prematurely \u2013 premature babies are more likely to develop a flattened head because their skull is softer when they're born and they may prefer to rest their head on one side at first because they're not yet able to move their head themselves neck muscle tightness \u2013 this can prevent a baby turning their head a particular way, meaning one side of their head is placed under more pressure Occasionally, a flattened head can be caused by the plates of the skull joining together too early. This is known as craniosynostosis. When to get medical advice Speak to your health visitor or GP if you're concerned about the shape of your baby's head or think they may have problems turning their head. They can examine your baby's head and suggest things you can do to help. A slightly flattened head isn't usually anything to worry about, but it's a good idea to get advice early on so you can take steps to stop it getting any worse. What you can do The shape of your baby's head should improve naturally over time as their skull develops and they start moving their head, rolling around, and crawling. Simple measures to take pressure off the flattened part of their head can also help: give your baby time on their tummy during the day \u2013 encourage them to try new positions during play time, but make sure they always sleep on their back as this is safest for them switch your baby between a sloping chair, a sling and a flat surface \u2013 this ensures there isn't constant pressure on one part of their head change the position of toys and mobiles in their cot \u2013 this will encourage your baby to turn their head on to the non-flattened side alternate the side you hold your baby when feeding and carrying reduce the time your baby spends lying on a firm flat surface, such as car seats and prams \u2013 try using a sling or front carrier when practical If your baby has difficulty turning their head, physiotherapy may help loosen and strengthen their neck muscles. Corrective surgery may be needed if they have craniosynostosis. Read more about treating craniosynostosis. Helmets, headbands and mattresses There are specially designed helmets and headbands that some people claim can help improve the shape of a baby's skull as they grow. These devices apply pressure to \"bulging\" parts of the skull and relieve pressure from other parts, potentially allowing growth in the flatter areas. Treatment is started when the child's skull is still soft, usually at around five or six months old, and the device is worn almost continuously (up to 23 hours a day) for several months. However, these helmets and headbands generally aren't recommended because: there isn't clear evidence to suggest they work they often cause problems such as skin irritation and rashes they're expensive, typically costing around £2,000 your baby will need to be checked every few weeks to monitor their head growth and make any necessary adjustments they may be uncomfortable and distressing for your baby Some people try special curved mattresses that are designed to distribute the weight of a baby's head over a larger area so less pressure is placed on a particular point of their skull. These are cheaper than helmets and headbands, but there's currently only limited evidence to suggest they may help. Will my child's head shape return to normal? Mild flattening of the head will usually improve if you use the simple measures outlined above, although it may be a couple of months before you start to notice an improvement. Your baby's head may not return to a completely perfect shape, but by the time they're one or two years old any flattening will be barely noticeable. More severe cases will also get better over time, although some flattening will usually remain. As your child becomes more mobile and their hair grows, the appearance of their head should improve. It's very rare for a child to experience problems such as teasing when they reach school age. You may consider using a helmet or headband if you're worried about your child, but it's not clear whether these always work. You should also bear in mind the inconvenience, expense, and possible discomfort for you and your child.

It usually occurs when bacteria or fungi enter the brain tissue after an infection or severe head injury. Although the risk of developing a brain abscess is extremely low in England, it is a life-threatening condition and should be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.  Symptoms of a brain abscess The symptoms of a brain abscess may develop quickly or slowly but can include: headache \u2013 which is often severe, located in a single section of the head and can't be relieved with painkillers changes in mental state \u2013 such as confusion or irritability problems with nerve function \u2013 such as muscle weakness, slurred speech or paralysis on one side of the body a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above  seizures (fits) nausea and vomiting stiff neck changes in vision \u2013 such as blurring, greying of vision or double vision (due to the abscess putting pressure on the optic nerve) When to seek medical advice Any symptoms that suggest a problem with the brain and nervous system should be treated as a medical emergency. These include: slurred speech muscle weakness or paralysis seizures occurring in a person with no previous history of seizures If you or someone you know experiences any of these symptoms, phone 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Any symptoms that suggest a worsening infection, such as fever and vomiting, should be reported to your GP immediately. If your GP isn't available, contact your local out-of-hours service or call NHS 111. Causes of a brain abscess There are three main ways a brain abscess can develop. These are: an infection in another part of the skull \u2013 such as an ear infection, sinusitis or dental abscess, which can spread directly into the brain an infection in another part of the body \u2013 for example, the infection that causes pneumonia spreading into the brain via the blood trauma, such as a severe head injury \u2013 that cracks open the skull, allowing bacteria or fungi to enter the brain However, in some cases, the source of the infection remains unknown. Read more about the causes of a brain abscess. Diagnosing a brain abscess If a brain abscess is suspected, an initial assessment will be made based on your symptoms, medical history and whether you've had a recent infection or a weakened immune system. Blood tests can also be carried out to check for an infection. If you're referred to hospital for further tests, you may have either: a computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 a series of X-rays are used to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u2013 which uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body. If an abscess is found, a procedure known as CT-guided aspiration may be used to remove a sample of pus for testing. This involves using a CT scan to guide a needle to the site of the abscess. Treating a brain abscess A brain abscess is regarded as a medical emergency. Swelling caused by the abscess can disrupt the blood and oxygen supply to the brain. There's also a risk of the abscess bursting (rupturing). If left untreated, a brain abscess can cause permanent brain damage and could be fatal. A brain abscess is usually treated using a combination of: medication \u2013 either antibiotics or antifungals surgery \u2013 either draining the pus through a hole in the skull (simple aspiration) or opening the skull and removing the abscess entirely (craniotomy) Treatment with antibiotics often begins before a diagnosis is confirmed, to reduce the risk of complications. Read more about treating a brain abscess. Complications of a brain abscess Complications of a brain abscess can include: a reoccurring abscess \u2013 seek immediate medical advice if you think there's even a small chance your abscess has reoccurred; this is more common in people with a weakened immune system or cyanotic heart disease brain damage \u2013 mild to moderate brain damage often improves with time but severe brain damage is likely to be permanent; brain damage is more of a risk if diagnosis and treatment are delayed epilepsy \u2013 where a person has repeated seizures (fits) meningitis \u2013 a life-threatening infection of the protective membranes around the brain, which requires urgent treatment; this is more common in children Page last reviewed: 20\/06\/2016 Next review due: 20\/06\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Aneurysms can develop in any blood vessel in the body, but the two most common places are: the abdominal aorta \u2013 the artery that transports blood away from the heart to the rest of the body the brain This topic is about brain aneurysms. There's a separate topic about abdominal aortic aneurysm. About brain aneurysms The medical term for an aneurysm that develops inside the brain is an intracranial or cerebral aneurysm. Most brain aneurysms only cause noticeable symptoms if they burst (rupture). This leads to an extremely serious condition known as a subarachnoid haemorrhage, where bleeding caused by the ruptured aneurysm can cause extensive brain damage and symptoms such as: a sudden agonising headache \u2013 it's been described as a \"thunderclap headache\", similar to a sudden hit on the head, resulting in a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before stiff neck sickness and vomiting pain on looking at light About three in five people who have a subarachnoid haemorrhage die within two weeks. Half of those who survive are left with severe brain damage and disability. Read more about the symptoms of a brain aneurysm. A ruptured brain aneurysm is a medical emergency. If you suspect someone has had a brain haemorrhage, which could be caused by a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. How brain aneurysms are treated If a brain aneurysm is detected before it ruptures, treatment may be recommended to prevent it rupturing in future. Most aneurysms won't rupture, so treatment is only carried out if the risk of a rupture is particularly high. Factors that affect whether treatment is recommended include your age, the size and position of the aneurysm, your family medical history, and any other health conditions you have. If treatment is recommended, this usually involves either filling the aneurysm with tiny metal coils or an open operation to seal it shut with a tiny metal clip. If your risk of a rupture is low, you'll have regular check-ups to monitor your aneurysm. You may also be given medication to reduce your blood pressure and advice about ways you can reduce your chances of a rupture, such as stopping smoking if you smoke. The same techniques used to prevent ruptures are also used to treat brain aneurysms that have already ruptured. Read more about diagnosing brain aneurysms and treating brain aneurysms. Why brain aneurysms develop Exactly what causes the wall of affected blood vessels to weaken is still unclear, although risk factors have been identified, including:  smoking high blood pressure a family history of brain aneurysms In some cases, an aneurysm may develop because there was a weakness in the walls of the blood vessels at birth. Read more about the causes of brain aneurysms. Who is affected? It's difficult to estimate exactly how many people are affected by brain aneurysms because they usually cause no symptoms and pass undetected. Some experts believe it could be as high as 1 in 20 people, while others think the figure is much lower at around 1 in 100 people. The number of aneurysms that actually rupture is much smaller. Only around 1 in 12,500 people have a ruptured brain aneurysm in England each year. Brain aneurysms can develop in anyone at any age, but are more common in people over the age of 40. Women tend to be affected more commonly than men. Preventing brain aneurysms The best way to prevent getting an aneurysm, or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing, is to avoid activities that could damage your blood vessels, such as: smoking eating a high-fat diet not controlling high blood pressure being overweight or obese Read more about preventing aneurysms.

When this happens, a ventilator keeps the person's heart beating and oxygen circulating through their bloodstream. A person is confirmed as being dead when their brain stem function is permanently lost. Confirming death Confirming death used to be straightforward. Death was said to occur when the heart stopped beating and a person was unresponsive and no longer breathing. The lack of oxygen, which occurred as a result of no blood flow, quickly led to the permanent loss of brain stem function. Confirming death is now more complex, because it's possible to keep the heart beating after the brain stem has permanently stopped functioning. This can be done by keeping a person on a ventilator, which allows the body and heart to be artificially oxygenated. However, that person won't ever regain consciousness or start breathing again. Once the brain stem has permanently stopped functioning, there's no way of reversing it and the heart will eventually stop beating, even if a ventilator continues to be used. To save a person's family and friends from unnecessary suffering, once there's clear evidence that brain death has occurred, the person will be disconnected from the ventilator. The brain stem The brain stem is the lower part of the brain that's connected to the spinal cord (part of the central nervous system in the spinal column). The brain stem is responsible for regulating most of the body's automatic functions that are essential for life. These include: breathing heartbeat blood pressure swallowing The brain stem also relays information to and from the brain to the rest of the body, so it plays an important role in the brain\u2019s core functions, such as consciousness, awareness and movement. After brain death, it's not possible for someone to remain conscious. How brain death occurs Brain death can occur when the blood and\/or oxygen supply to the brain is stopped. This can be caused by: cardiac arrest \u2013 when the heart stops beating and the brain is starved of oxygen heart attack \u2013 a serious medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked stroke \u2013 a serious medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is blocked or interrupted blood clot \u2013 a blockage in a blood vessel that disturbs or blocks the flow of blood around your body Brain death can also occur as a result of: a severe head injury a brain haemorrhage infections, such as encephalitis    a brain tumour  Vegetative state There's a difference between brain death and a vegetative state, which can occur after extensive brain damage. Someone in a vegetative state can show signs of wakefulness \u2013 for example, they may open their eyes, but not respond to their surroundings. In rare cases, a person may demonstrate some sense of response that can be detected using a brain scan, but not be able to interact with their surroundings. However, the important difference between brain death and a vegetative state is that someone in a vegetative state still has a functioning brain stem, which means that: some form of consciousness may exist breathing unaided is usually possible  there's a slim chance of recovery, because the brain stem's core functions may be unaffected A person who is brain dead has no chance of recovery, because their body is unable to survive without artificial support. Confirming brain death Although rare, a few things can make it appear as though someone is brain dead. These include drug overdoses (particularly from barbiturates) and severe hypothermia (where body temperature drops below 28C). Therefore, a number of tests are carried out to check that brain death has actually occurred, such as shining a torch into both eyes to see if they react to the light. Read more about confirming brain death. Organ donation After brain death has occurred, it may be possible for the person's organs to be used in transplantations, which can often save the lives of others. In cases where a deceased person hasn't made their wishes clear, deciding whether to donate their organs can be a difficult decision for partners and relatives. Hospital staff are aware of these difficulties and will try to ensure the issue is handled sensitively and thoughtfully. Read more about organ donation.

It's a very serious condition and can be fatal. Subarachnoid haemorrhages account for around 1 in every 20 strokes in the UK. Symptoms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage There are usually no warning signs but a subarachnoid haemorrhage sometimes happens during physical effort or straining \u2013 such as coughing, going to the toilet, lifting something heavy or having sex. The main symptoms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage include: a sudden agonising headache \u2013 which is often described as being similar to a sudden hit on the head, resulting in a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before a stiff neck feeling and being sick sensitivity to light (photophobia) blurred or double vision stroke-like symptoms \u2013 such as slurred speech and weakness on one side of the body loss of consciousness or convulsions (uncontrollable shaking) A subarachnoid haemorrhage is a medical emergency. Dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you, or someone in your care, has these symptoms. How a subarachnoid haemorrhage is treated A person with a suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage needs a computerised tomography (CT) scan in hospital to check for signs of bleeding around the brain. If a diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage is confirmed or strongly suspected, you're likely to be transferred to a specialist neurosciences unit. Medication will usually be given to help prevent short-term complications (see below) and a procedure to repair the source of the bleeding may be carried out. Read more about:  diagnosing a subarachnoid haemorrhage treating a subarachnoid haemorrhage What causes subarachnoid haemorrhages? The majority of subarachnoid haemorrhages are caused by a brain aneurysm bursting. A brain aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel, caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall. It's not known exactly why brain aneurysms develop in some people. However, certain risk factors have been identified, including: smoking high blood pressure excessive alcohol consumption Less common causes of subarachnoid haemorrhages include having abnormally developed blood vessels and inflammation of blood vessels in the brain. Severe head injuries often cause subarachnoid bleeding, but this is a separate problem known as a \"traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage\". Read more about the causes of subarachnoid haemorrhages. Who's affected? Between April 2013 and April 2014, more than 6,000 people were admitted to hospitals in England with a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Subarachnoid haemorrhages can happen at any age but they're most common in people aged between 45 and 70. Slightly more women are affected than men. Subarachnoid haemorrhages are also more common in black people compared to other ethnic groups. This could be because black people are more likely to have high blood pressure. Read more about black health issues. Reducing your risk It's not always possible to prevent a subarachnoid haemorrhage, but there are some things you can do to reduce your risk. The three most effective steps you can take to reduce your chances of having a subarachnoid haemorrhage are: stop smoking \u2013 your GP can refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking Service for help and advice or you can call the NHS Smoking Helpline on 0300 123 1044 moderate your alcohol consumption take steps to prevent high blood pressure \u2013 such as regular exercise, eating a healthy diet and losing weight if you're overweight Possible complications A subarachnoid haemorrhage can cause both short and long-term complications. Serious short-term complications can include further bleeding at the site of any aneurysm and brain damage caused by a reduction in blood supply to the brain. Long-term complications include: epilepsy \u2013 where a person has repeated seizures (fits) problems with certain mental functions, such as memory, planning and concentration changes in mood, such as depression Read more about the complications of a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Outlook Although the outlook for subarachnoid haemorrhage has improved in the last few decades, around half of all cases are fatal, and people who survive can be left with long-term problems. Recovering after a subarachnoid haemorrhage can also be a slow and frustrating process, and it's common to have problems such as: extreme tiredness headaches problems sleeping Read more about recovering from a subarachnoid haemorrhage.

This topic focuses on severe head injury. Read about minor head injuries. Symptoms of a severe head injury can include: unconsciousness \u2013 where a person has collapsed and is unresponsive, even for a brief period of time concussion \u2013 a sudden but short-lived loss of mental function that occurs after a blow or other injury to the head; a person with concussion may have a glazed look or appear confused, but won\u2019t necessarily be unconscious  fits or seizures  difficulty speaking or staying awake problems with the senses \u2013 such as hearing loss or double vision repeated episodes of vomiting blood or clear fluid coming from the ears or nose memory loss (amnesia) sudden swelling or bruising around both eyes or behind the ear difficulty with walking or co-ordination Dial 999 immediately to request an ambulance if you're with someone who experiences any of these symptoms after sustaining a head injury. Alternatively, take them immediately to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. You should also go to hospital if someone has injured their head and: the injury was caused by a forceful blow to the head at speed, such as being hit by a car or falling one metre or more the person has had previous brain surgery the person has had previous problems with uncontrollable bleeding or a blood clotting disorder, or is taking medication that may cause bleeding problems, such as warfarin the person has been drinking alcohol or has taken drugs the injury wasn't accidental \u2013 for example, you deliberately hurt yourself or someone else hurt you on purpose Diagnosing a severe head injury If you\u2019ve had a severe head injury and there\u2019s a chance you may have a brain injury, you\u2019ll have a computerised tomography (CT) scan to assess the seriousness of the injury. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is often used to assess head injuries. This is a scale from 3 to 15 that identifies how serious your head injury is, based on your symptoms and whether the brain has been damaged (with 3 being most severe and 15 the least severe). A GCS score of 13 or above would indicate a minor head injury. A score of 9 to 12 would be a moderate head injury. If a person has a severe head injury, they'll have a score of 8 or less. Some people with significant head injuries have a high GCS score initially, but their score decreases when they're reassessed at a later stage. If you have a severe head injury, you\u2019ll be closely monitored and frequently reassessed to check your condition. Read more about how severe head injuries are diagnosed. Treating a severe head injury Severe head injuries always require hospital treatment. This may involve: observing the condition for any changes running tests to check for further damage treating any other injuries breathing support (ventilation) or brain surgery Most people are able to go home within 48 hours. However, a small number of those admitted to hospital require skull or brain surgery. When you're discharged from hospital, your doctor will advise you on the best way to help your recovery when you return home. Read more about how a severe head injury is treated and recovering from a severe head injury. Complications A severe head injury can result in pressure being placed on the brain because of bleeding, blood clots or a build-up of fluid. This can sometimes lead to brain damage, which can be temporary or permanent. A severe head injury can also cause other potentially serious complications, including: an infection after a skull fracture  impaired consciousness brain injury Around 1 in every 2,000 people who attend an A&E department with a head injury dies as a result of their injury. Read more about complications after a severe head injury. Preventing head injuries It can be difficult to predict or avoid a head injury, but there are some things you can do to reduce the risk of serious injury. These include: ensuring your home (or those of elderly relatives) are free of trip hazards that could cause a fall, such as loose carpets or unnecessary items on the floor \"childproofing\" your home \u2013 for example, by ensuring young children can\u2019t reach windows or balconies using the right safety equipment for work, sport and DIY Wearing a safety helmet during certain activities, such as skiing or cycling, may also help to prevent a serious head injury. Read more about cycle safety, preventing falls and preventing accidents to children in the home.

It can either be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Brain tumours are graded from 1 to 4 according to their behaviour, such as how fast they grow and how likely they are to grow back after treatment.  Benign brain tumours are low grade (grade 1 or 2), which means they grow slowly and are less likely to return after treatment. Malignant brain tumours are high grade (grade 3 or 4) and either start in the brain (primary tumours) or spread into the brain from elsewhere (secondary tumours); they're more likely to grow back after treatment. This page gives general information relevant to both types of brain tumour. The links above will take you to more information about the specific types. Symptoms of a brain tumour The symptoms of a brain tumour vary depending on the exact part of the brain that's affected. Common symptoms include: severe, persistent headaches seizures (fits) persistent nausea, vomiting and drowsiness mental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality progressive weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, vision problems, or speech problems Sometimes, you may not have any symptoms to begin with or they may only develop very slowly over time. When to see your GP See your GP if you have persistent symptoms of a brain tumour. While it's unlikely to be a tumour, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis. If your GP is unable to identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a neurologist for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan. Who is affected Brain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults. More than 9,000 people are diagnosed with primary brain tumours in the UK each year, of which about half are benign and half are malignant. Many others are diagnosed with secondary brain tumours. The exact reason why some people develop primary brain tumours is unknown, but it's thought that certain genetic conditions \u2013 such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis \u2013 and previous radiotherapy to the head increase your risk. Treatment and outlook The main treatment for most brain tumours is surgery, which aims to remove as much of the abnormal tissue as possible. It's not always possible to remove the entire tumour, so further treatment with radiotherapy and\/or chemotherapy may be necessary to kill any abnormal cells left behind. For most benign tumours, treatment is often successful and a full recovery is possible, although there's sometimes a small chance the tumour could come back. Regular follow-up appointments will normally be recommended to monitor this. The outlook for malignant tumours is generally less good, although this varies depending on things such as where the tumour is in the brain, your age, and your general health. Unfortunately, a cure is often not possible and most tumours will return after treatment. If a tumour does come back, treatment will aim to relieve your symptoms and prolong life by controlling the growth of the tumour.  Support and further information As well as reading the separate pages on benign brain tumours and malignant brain tumours, you may find the following websites useful sources of information and support: The Brain Tumour Charity Brain Tumour Research HeadSmart: be brain tumour aware Cancer Research UK: brain tumours  Macmillan: brain tumours Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 17\/03\/2015 Next review due: 17\/03\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It usually stays in one place and does not spread. Generally, brain tumours are graded from 1 to 4, according to their behaviour, such as how fast they grow and how likely they are to grow back after treatment. Grade 1 tumours are the least aggressive and grade 4 are the most harmful and cancerous. Cancerous tumours are described as \"malignant\".  Low-grade brain tumours \u2013 grades 1 or 2 \u2013 tend to be slow-growing and unlikely to spread, so they're usually classed as benign. These tumours aren't cancerous and can often be successfully treated. However, they are still serious and can be life-threatening. These pages focus on low-grade brain tumours. For information on grade 3 or 4 brain tumours, see the separate topic on high-grade (malignant) tumours. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of a low-grade or benign brain tumour depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain. Some slow-growing tumours may not cause any symptoms at first. Common symptoms include: severe, persistent headaches seizures (fits) persistent nausea, vomiting and drowsiness mental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality progressive weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, vision problems, or speech problems See your GP if you have persistent symptoms of a brain tumour. While it's unlikely to be a tumour, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis. Read more about the symptoms of benign brain tumours and diagnosing benign brain tumours. Types of benign brain tumour There are many different types of benign brain tumours, depending on the type of brain cells they have grown from. Examples include: gliomas \u2013 tumours of the glial tissue, which binds nerve cells and fibres together meningiomas \u2013 tumours of the membranes that cover the brain acoustic neuromas \u2013 tumours in the acoustic nerve, which helps to control hearing and balance craniopharyngiomas \u2013 tumours near the base of the brain that are most often diagnosed in children, teenagers and young adults haemangioblastomas \u2013 tumours of the brain's blood vessels pituitary adenomas \u2013 tumours of the pituitary gland (the pea-sized gland below the brain) Who is affected Brain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults. About 4,300 people are diagnosed with benign brain tumours in the UK each year. The majority of these are low-grade gliomas. In most cases, it's not clear why a person has developed a brain tumour, although it's thought that certain genetic conditions and previous radiotherapy treatment to the head may increase the risk of one developing. Read more about the causes of benign brain tumours. How benign brain tumours are treated Treatment for benign brain tumours depends on the type and location of the tumour, and your outlook will depend on whether the tumour grows back and whether it mutates (changes). Many benign brain tumours can be surgically removed and don't come back once they have been removed. However, some tumours can grow back or may become cancerous. If surgery is not suitable, or it's not possible to remove the entire tumour, you may need other treatments such as radiotherapy and\/or chemotherapy to destroy the abnormal cells in the brain. Read more about treating a benign brain tumour.  Recovering from a benign brain tumour After treatment, you may be left with some persistent problems, such as seizures, difficulty walking, or speech problems. In these cases, you may need supportive treatment to help you recover from or adapt to these problems. Many people are eventually able to return to most of their normal activities, including sports and work, but this can take time. You can be referred to a counsellor if you want to talk about the emotional aspects of your diagnosis and treatment. There are also many organisations that can provide information and support, such as The Brain Tumour Charity and Brain Tumour Research.

Generally, brain tumours are graded from 1 to 4, according to their behaviour, such as how fast they grow and how likely they are to grow back after treatment. A malignant brain tumour is either grade 3 or 4, whereas grade 1 or 2 tumours are usually classed as benign or non-cancerous.  Most malignant tumours are secondary cancers, which means they started in another part of the body and spread to the brain. Primary brain tumours are those that started in the brain. These pages focus on high-grade brain tumours. For information about grade 1 or 2 tumours, read our pages on low-grade (benign) brain tumours. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of a malignant brain tumour depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain. Common symptoms include: severe, persistent headaches seizures (fits) persistent nausea, vomiting and drowsiness mental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality progressive weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, vision problems, or speech problems See your GP if you have persistent symptoms of a brain tumour. While it's unlikely to be a tumour, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis. Read more about the symptoms of malignant brain tumours and diagnosing malignant brain tumours. Types of malignant tumours Most malignant brain tumours develop from the glial tissue, which supports the brain's nerve cells. These tumours are known as gliomas. Gliomas can be separated further, depending on the cells they developed from. For example: an astrocytoma develops from cells thought to provide the brain's framework an oligodendroglioma develops from the cells that produce the fatty covering of nerves an ependymoma develops from the cells that line the cavities in the brain   It's also possible to have a malignant tumour that's a mixture of these types or developed in a different part of the brain. Who is affected Brain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults. Around 5,000 people are diagnosed with a primary malignant brain tumour in the UK each year. Many others are diagnosed with secondary tumours. The exact cause of primary malignant brain tumours is unknown, although it's thought that certain genetic conditions and previous radiotherapy treatment to the head may increase the risk of one developing. Read more about the causes of malignant brain tumours. How malignant brain tumours are treated A primary malignant brain tumour needs to be treated as soon as possible, because it can spread and damage other parts of the brain and spinal cord. Surgery will usually need to be carried out to remove as much of the tumour as possible. This may be followed by radiotherapy and\/or chemotherapy to kill any cancerous cells left behind and reduce the chances of the tumour regrowing. However, malignant tumours will often eventually return after treatment. If this happens, or if you have a secondary tumour, a cure isn't usually possible and treatment can instead be used to improve symptoms and prolong life. Read more about treating malignant brain tumours. Living with a brain tumour Living with a brain tumour is not easy. You may feel worried and anxious about what's going to happen to you and your family. This is perfectly normal. It can help to seek accurate medical information about your specific tumour and its treatment, make sure you're closely involved in decisions about your care, and ask your care team about anything you're not sure about. You can read more about living with a brain tumour on The Brain Tumour Charity's website. Your doctor may be able to refer you to a counsellor if you want to talk about the emotional aspects of diagnosis and treatment. There are also many organisations and helplines that can help, such as The Brain Tumour Charity and Brain Tumour Research. Support for carers Being a carer is not an easy role. When you are busy responding to the needs of others, it can deplete your reserves of emotional and physical energy, and make it easy for you to forget your own health and mental wellbeing. Research on carers\u2019 health shows that high numbers of carers suffer health effects through caring. If you are trying to combine caring with a paid job or looking after a family, this can cause even more stress. However, neglecting your own health doesn't work in the long term. If you're caring for someone else, it\u2019s important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It's in your best interests and those of the person you are caring for. For more information on the support available to you and benefits you may be entitled to, visit the care and support section of this website. Recovery and outlook The outcome for malignant primary brain tumours depends on a number of things, such as the type and location of the tumour, your age, and how ill you were when diagnosed. Overall, around 40% of people live at least a year, about 19% live at least five years, and around 14% live at least 10 years. If treatment is successful, you may still be left with some persistent problems, such as seizures, walking difficulties, or speech problems. You may need supportive treatment to help you recover from or adapt to these problems. You'll also need regular follow-up appointments to check if the tumour has started to come back. Read more about recovering from treatment for a malignant brain tumour. Brain tumours in children This topic covers malignant brain tumours in general and applies to both adults and children. Macmillan has specific information about brain tumours in children, including medulloblastoma \u2013 a brain tumour that mainly affects children.

Inheriting faulty versions or \"variants\" of these genes significantly raises your risk of developing cancer, because the altered genes cannot repair the damaged cells, which can build up and form a tumour. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two examples of genes that raise your cancer risk if they become altered. Having a variant BRCA gene greatly increases a woman's chance of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. This was the reason Angelina Jolie had preventative breast cancer surgery, followed by ovarian cancer surgery. They also increase a man's chance of developing male breast cancer and prostate cancer.  BRCA genes are not the only cancer risk genes. Researchers recently identified more than 100 new gene variants associated with an increased risk of breast, prostate and ovarian cancer. Individually, these new gene variants only slightly increase the risk of cancer, but a combination could mean a high risk overall. If you or your partner have a high-risk cancer gene, such as an altered version of BRCA1, it can be passed on to any children you have.  If you're concerned, read on. This page covers: What to do if you're worried  Pros and cons of having a predictive genetic test  What testing involves  What a positive result means   Managing your risk  Telling close relatives  Planning a family  Paying for private testing What to do if you're worried  Speak to your GP if cancer runs in your family and you're worried you may get it too. They may refer you to a local genetics service for an NHS genetic test, which will tell you if you have inherited one of the cancer risk genes.  This type of testing is known as predictive genetic testing. It's \"predictive\" because a positive result means you have a greatly increased risk of developing cancer. It doesn't mean you have cancer or are definitely going to develop it. You may be eligible for this NHS test if the faulty gene has already been identified in one of your relatives, or if there is a strong family history of cancer in your family. See What testing involves, below. Pros and cons of having a predictive genetic test  Not everyone who is eligible for the NHS test will want to have it. It's a personal decision, and should only be made after you've had genetic counselling sessions and talked through what having the test means, how you may feel and how you will cope. Advantages a positive result means you can take steps to manage your risk of developing cancer \u2013 you can make certain lifestyle changes to lower your risk, have regular screening and have preventative treatment (see Managing your risk, below) knowing the result may reduce any stress and anxiety that comes from not knowing Disadvantages the results of some genetic tests are inconclusive \u2013 doctors may identify a variation in a gene, but not know what effect it may have a positive result may cause permanent anxiety \u2013 some people would rather not know about their risk and only want to be told if they actually develop cancer What testing involves   There are usually two steps to genetic testing: A relative with cancer has a diagnostic blood test to see if they have a cancer risk gene (this normally must happen before any healthy relatives are tested). Their result will be ready four to eight weeks later. If your relative's test is positive, you can have the predictive genetic test to see if you have the same faulty gene. Your GP will refer you to your local genetics service for the blood test (you'll need a copy of your relative's test results). The result will take up to two weeks to come through after a blood sample is taken, but this may not happen at your first appointment. This test is fully predictive as a \"clear\" negative test, which will mean you have not inherited the family high risk of cancer. The charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer explains the importance of these two steps: \"Without looking at the genes of an affected relative first, testing a healthy individual would be like reading through an entire book looking for a spelling mistake without knowing where the mistake is, or if there is a mistake at all.\" When there are no affected relatives available, full testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 may be possible for those with at least a 10% chance of having a genetic fault. This usually means having a very strong family history of early onset breast and particularly ovarian cancer. It takes four to eight weeks to get the result, but this is not fully predictive as a negative test, so cannot rule out that the problem in relatives is due to a different gene. What a positive result means  If your predictive genetic test result is positive, it means you have a faulty gene that raises your risk of developing cancer. It doesn't mean you are guaranteed to get cancer \u2013 your genes only partly influence your future health risks. Other factors, such as your medical history, lifestyle and your environment, also play a role. If you have one of the faulty BRCA genes, there is a 50% chance you will pass this on to any children you have and a 50% chance that each of your siblings also has it. You may want to discuss your results with other members of your family, who may also be affected. The genetics clinic will discuss with you how a positive or negative result will affect your life and your relationships with your family. You can read more about this in the beginner's guide to BRCA1 and BRCA2 (PDF, 866kb) produced by The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. Insurance companies cannot ask you to disclose the results of predictive genetic tests for the majority of policies, but this may change in the future. Managing your risk   If your test result is positive, you have a range of options to manage your risk. Risk-reducing surgery is not the only option. Ultimately, there's no right or wrong answer about what you should do \u2013 it's a decision only you can make. Regularly examining your breasts If you have the faulty BRCA1\/2 gene, it's a good idea to be aware of changes in your breasts. Read more about being breast cancer aware. This advice applies to men with a faulty BRCA2 gene too, as they are also at increased risk of breast cancer (although to a lesser extent). Screening In the case of breast cancer, annual breast screening in the form of mammograms and MRI scans can also monitor your condition and catch cancer early, if it does develop. Detecting breast cancer at an early stage means it may be easier to treat. The chance of making a full recovery from breast cancer, especially if it is detected early, is relatively high compared with other forms of cancer. Unfortunately, there's currently no reliable screening test for ovarian cancer or prostate cancer. Read more about screening for prostate cancer. However, annual PSA tests for prostate cancer may benefit men who carry the faulty BRCA2 gene. Lifestyle changes Changes in your lifestyle can sometimes reduce your individual cancer risk. These include taking plenty of exercise and eating a healthy diet. If you have a faulty BRCA gene, be aware of other factors that could increase your risk of breast cancer. It's recommended that you avoid: the oral contraceptive pill if you are over 35 combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) if you\u2019re over 50 drinking more than the maximum recommended daily limits of alcohol being overweight The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also recommends that women with a family history of breast cancer breastfeed their children, if possible. Read about the things that may help to prevent ovarian cancer. Medication (chemoprevention) NICE has recommended treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene for a specific group of women who have a high risk of developing breast cancer. These medicines can reduce the risk of breast cancer for up to 20 years from five years of taking them. For more information, read the article: Drugs to be offered to women at high risk of breast cancer, which also explains the side effects these medicines can cause. Read the full NICE 2013 guidelines on familial breast cancer.   Risk-reducing surgery Risk-reducing surgery means removing all the tissue (such as the breasts or ovaries) that could become cancerous. Carriers of a faulty BRCA gene may wish to consider a preventative mastectomy.   Women who have risk-reducing mastectomies reduce their risk of developing breast cancer by around 90%. However, a mastectomy is a major operation and recovering from it can be physically and emotionally difficult. Surgery can also be used to reduce ovarian cancer risk. Women who have their ovaries removed before the menopause not only dramatically reduce their risk of developing ovarian cancer, but also reduce their risk of developing breast cancer by up to 50%. However, this will trigger an early menopause and mean you're not able to have your own children (unless you store eggs or embryos). Read more about surgery to remove the ovaries, including the risks and after-effects. The risk of ovarian cancer in women who carry a BRCA gene fault does not begin to rise significantly until about the age of 40. Therefore, carriers of the faulty gene who are younger than 40 usually wait to have this operation. Telling close relatives   Your genetics unit will not approach your relatives about your result \u2013 it will usually be up to you to tell your family. You may be given a standard letter to share with relatives, which explains your test result and contains all the information they need to be referred for the test themselves. However, not everyone will want to have the genetic test. Women who are closely related to you (such as your sister or daughter) can have cancer screening without having genetic testing. Planning a family  Cancer risk genes can be passed on to any children you have. If your predictive genetic test is positive and you want to start a family, you have several options. You can: Have your children without any intervention, and risk your child inheriting the faulty gene. Adopt a baby. Use donor eggs or donor sperm (depending on who carries the faulty gene) to avoid passing on the faulty gene. Have prenatal testing, which is a test done in pregnancy that reveals whether your baby has the faulty gene. You can then plan to continue or terminate the pregnancy, depending on the test result. Have pre-implantation genetic diagnosis \u2013 a technique used to select embryos that have not inherited the faulty gene. However, there is no guarantee this technique will result in a successful pregnancy, and funding for it on the NHS may not be available to all patients. Paying for private testing If there isn't a strong family history of cancer in your family and the faulty gene hasn't otherwise been identified in any of your relatives, you won't be eligible for the NHS genetic test. You'll have to pay for it privately if you still wish to have the test. Consider this carefully, because: if you don't have any family history of cancer, it's unlikely you have one of the faulty genes the tests can be expensive, potentially costing up to £500-2,000 or more there's no guarantee they will predict whether you'll develop cancer you may not be offered genetic counselling to help you make a decision and support you once you get your results About BRCA1 and BRCA2 If you have a fault (mutation) in one of the BRCA genes, your risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer is greatly increased.   Women with the faulty BRCA1 gene, for example, have a 60-90% lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 40-60% risk of ovarian cancer. In other words, out of every 100 women with the faulty BRCA1 gene, between 60 and 90 will develop breast cancer in their lifetime and between 40 and 60 will develop ovarian cancer. The faulty BRCA genes affect around 1 in every 400 people, but people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are at a much higher risk (as many as 1 in 40 may carry the faulty gene). For more information, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust has produced a beginner's guide to BRCA1 and BRCA2 (PDF, 867kb).

Most abscesses develop just under the skin and are caused by a bacterial infection. Breast abscesses are painful, swollen lumps that may also: be red feel hot cause the surrounding skin to swell cause a fever (high temperature) What causes a breast abscess?  Breast abscesses are often linked to mastitis \u2013 a condition that causes breast pain and swelling (inflammation), and usually affects women who are breastfeeding. Infections can occur during breastfeeding if bacteria enter your breast tissue, or if the milk ducts (tiny tubes) become blocked. This can cause mastitis which, if not treated, can result in an abscess forming. Women who aren't breastfeeding can also develop mastitis if bacteria enter the milk ducts through a sore or cracked nipple, or a nipple piercing. White blood cells are sent to attack the infection, which causes tissue at the site of the infection to die. This creates a small, hollow area that fills with pus (an abscess). Read more about what causes breast abscesses. When to visit your GP See your GP if your breast is red and sore. If you have mastitis, antibiotics may be prescribed to treat the infection. If your symptoms persist after taking antibiotics, your GP may refer you for an ultrasound scan, which will confirm whether you have a breast abscess. This type of scan uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body. Treating a breast abscess A breast abscess will need to be drained. Small breast abscesses can be drained using a needle and syringe. If the abscess is large, a small incision may be needed to drain the pus. For both procedures, a local anaesthetic will usually be given to numb the skin around the abscess so you don't feel any pain or discomfort. Read more about how breast abscesses are treated. Breast abscesses are painful, pus-filled lumps that develop under the skin of the breast  How common are breast abscesses? Breast abscesses most commonly affect women who are 18-50 years of age. They're often linked to mastitis, which affects up to 1 in 10 breastfeeding women and causes the breast to become red and sore. One study found that around 3% of women with mastitis who were treated with antibiotic medicines developed a breast abscess.

In 2011, just under 50,000 women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Most women who get it (8 out of 10) are over 50, but younger women, and in rare cases, men, can also get breast cancer. If it's treated early enough, breast cancer can be prevented from spreading to other parts of the body. The breasts The breasts are made up of fat, connective tissue and thousands of tiny glands called lobules, which produce milk. When a woman has a baby, the milk is delivered to the nipple through tiny tubes called ducts, which allow her to breastfeed. The body is made up of billions of tiny cells, which usually grow and multiply in an orderly way. New cells are only produced when and where they're needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably. Read more about the causes of breast cancer. Symptoms of breast cancer Breast cancer can have a number of symptoms, but the first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue. Most breast lumps aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by your doctor. You should also see your GP if you notice any of the following: a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts discharge from either of your nipples (which may be streaked with blood) a lump or swelling in either of your armpits dimpling on the skin of your breasts a rash on or around your nipple a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast Breast pain isn't usually a symptom of breast cancer. Learn more about the symptoms of breast cancer. After examining your breasts, your GP may refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests. This might include a mammography (breast screening) or a biopsy. Read more about breast screening and how breast cancer is diagnosed. Types of breast cancer There are several different types of breast cancer, which can develop in different parts of the breast. Breast cancer is often divided into non-invasive and invasive types. Non-invasive breast cancer Non-invasive breast cancer is also known as cancer or carcinoma in situ. This cancer is found in the ducts of the breast and hasn't developed the ability to spread outside the breast. This form of cancer rarely shows as a lump in the breast that can be felt, and is usually found on a mammogram (see below). The most common type of non-invasive cancer is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Invasive breast cancer Invasive cancer has the ability to spread outside the breast, although this doesn't necessarily mean it has spread. The most common form of breast cancer is invasive ductal breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the breast ducts. Invasive ductal breast cancer accounts for about 80% of all breast cancer cases and is sometimes called \"no special type\". Other types of breast cancer Other less common types of breast cancer include invasive lobular breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the milk-producing lobules, inflammatory breast cancer and Paget's disease of the breast. It's possible for breast cancer to spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymph nodes (small glands that filter bacteria from the body) or the bloodstream. If this happens, it's known as \"secondary\" or \"metastatic\" breast cancer. Breast cancer screening About one in eight women are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. There's a good chance of recovery if it's detected in its early stages. For this reason, it's vital that women check their breasts regularly for any changes and always get any changes examined by their GP. Mammographic screening (where X-ray images of the breast are taken) is the best available method of detecting an early breast lesion. However, you should be aware that a mammogram might fail to detect some breast cancers. It might also increase your chances of having extra tests and interventions, including surgery. Women with a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer may be offered screening and genetic testing for the condition. As the risk of breast cancer increases with age, all women who are 50-70 years old are invited for breast cancer screening every three years. Women over 70 are also entitled to screening and can arrange an appointment through their GP or local screening unit. The NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47-73. Read more about breast screening and find breast cancer screening services near you. Treating breast cancer If cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads to nearby parts of the body. Breast cancer is treated using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgery is usually the first type of treatment you'll have, followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments. The type of surgery and the treatment you have afterwards will depend on the type of breast cancer you have. Your doctor will discuss the best treatment plan with you. Read a document listing the one-year net survival estimates by CCG for breast cancer In a small proportion of women, breast cancer is discovered after it's spread to other parts of the body (metastasis). Secondary cancer, also called advanced or metastatic cancer, isn't curable, so the aim of treatment is to achieve remission (symptom relief). Read more about treating breast cancer. How well your local NHS performs Clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) are NHS organisations that organise the delivery of NHS services in England. They play a major role in achieving good health outcomes for the local population that they serve. You can now check how your local CCG compares against others for breast cancer survival (PDF, 900 Kb). Preventing breast cancer As the causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood, it's not possible to know if it can be prevented altogether. If you're at increased risk of developing the condition, some treatments are available to reduce the risk. Studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions, there are benefits for women who maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly and who have a low intake of saturated fat and alcohol. It's been suggested that regular exercise can reduce your risk of breast cancer by as much as a third. If you've been through the menopause, it's particularly important that you're not overweight or obese. This is because being overweight or obese causes more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer. Read more about preventing breast cancer. Living with breast cancer Being diagnosed with breast cancer can affect daily life in many ways, depending on what stage it's at and what treatment you're having. How women cope with their diagnosis and treatment varies from person to person. You can be reassured that there are several forms of support available, if you need it. For example: your family and friends can be a powerful support system you can communicate with other people in the same situation find out as much as possible about your condition don't try to do too much or overexert yourself make time for yourself Read more about living with breast cancer.

Inheriting faulty versions or \"variants\" of these genes significantly raises your risk of developing cancer, because the altered genes cannot repair the damaged cells, which can build up and form a tumour. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two examples of genes that raise your cancer risk if they become altered. Having a variant BRCA gene greatly increases a woman's chance of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. This was the reason Angelina Jolie had preventative breast cancer surgery, followed by ovarian cancer surgery. They also increase a man's chance of developing male breast cancer and prostate cancer.  BRCA genes are not the only cancer risk genes. Researchers recently identified more than 100 new gene variants associated with an increased risk of breast, prostate and ovarian cancer. Individually, these new gene variants only slightly increase the risk of cancer, but a combination could mean a high risk overall. If you or your partner have a high-risk cancer gene, such as an altered version of BRCA1, it can be passed on to any children you have.  If you're concerned, read on. This page covers: What to do if you're worried  Pros and cons of having a predictive genetic test  What testing involves  What a positive result means   Managing your risk  Telling close relatives  Planning a family  Paying for private testing What to do if you're worried  Speak to your GP if cancer runs in your family and you're worried you may get it too. They may refer you to a local genetics service for an NHS genetic test, which will tell you if you have inherited one of the cancer risk genes.  This type of testing is known as predictive genetic testing. It's \"predictive\" because a positive result means you have a greatly increased risk of developing cancer. It doesn't mean you have cancer or are definitely going to develop it. You may be eligible for this NHS test if the faulty gene has already been identified in one of your relatives, or if there is a strong family history of cancer in your family. See What testing involves, below. Pros and cons of having a predictive genetic test  Not everyone who is eligible for the NHS test will want to have it. It's a personal decision, and should only be made after you've had genetic counselling sessions and talked through what having the test means, how you may feel and how you will cope. Advantages a positive result means you can take steps to manage your risk of developing cancer \u2013 you can make certain lifestyle changes to lower your risk, have regular screening and have preventative treatment (see Managing your risk, below) knowing the result may reduce any stress and anxiety that comes from not knowing Disadvantages the results of some genetic tests are inconclusive \u2013 doctors may identify a variation in a gene, but not know what effect it may have a positive result may cause permanent anxiety \u2013 some people would rather not know about their risk and only want to be told if they actually develop cancer What testing involves   There are usually two steps to genetic testing: A relative with cancer has a diagnostic blood test to see if they have a cancer risk gene (this normally must happen before any healthy relatives are tested). Their result will be ready four to eight weeks later. If your relative's test is positive, you can have the predictive genetic test to see if you have the same faulty gene. Your GP will refer you to your local genetics service for the blood test (you'll need a copy of your relative's test results). The result will take up to two weeks to come through after a blood sample is taken, but this may not happen at your first appointment. This test is fully predictive as a \"clear\" negative test, which will mean you have not inherited the family high risk of cancer. The charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer explains the importance of these two steps: \"Without looking at the genes of an affected relative first, testing a healthy individual would be like reading through an entire book looking for a spelling mistake without knowing where the mistake is, or if there is a mistake at all.\" When there are no affected relatives available, full testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 may be possible for those with at least a 10% chance of having a genetic fault. This usually means having a very strong family history of early onset breast and particularly ovarian cancer. It takes four to eight weeks to get the result, but this is not fully predictive as a negative test, so cannot rule out that the problem in relatives is due to a different gene. What a positive result means  If your predictive genetic test result is positive, it means you have a faulty gene that raises your risk of developing cancer. It doesn't mean you are guaranteed to get cancer \u2013 your genes only partly influence your future health risks. Other factors, such as your medical history, lifestyle and your environment, also play a role. If you have one of the faulty BRCA genes, there is a 50% chance you will pass this on to any children you have and a 50% chance that each of your siblings also has it. You may want to discuss your results with other members of your family, who may also be affected. The genetics clinic will discuss with you how a positive or negative result will affect your life and your relationships with your family. You can read more about this in the beginner's guide to BRCA1 and BRCA2 (PDF, 866kb) produced by The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. Insurance companies cannot ask you to disclose the results of predictive genetic tests for the majority of policies, but this may change in the future. Managing your risk   If your test result is positive, you have a range of options to manage your risk. Risk-reducing surgery is not the only option. Ultimately, there's no right or wrong answer about what you should do \u2013 it's a decision only you can make. Regularly examining your breasts If you have the faulty BRCA1\/2 gene, it's a good idea to be aware of changes in your breasts. Read more about being breast cancer aware. This advice applies to men with a faulty BRCA2 gene too, as they are also at increased risk of breast cancer (although to a lesser extent). Screening In the case of breast cancer, annual breast screening in the form of mammograms and MRI scans can also monitor your condition and catch cancer early, if it does develop. Detecting breast cancer at an early stage means it may be easier to treat. The chance of making a full recovery from breast cancer, especially if it is detected early, is relatively high compared with other forms of cancer. Unfortunately, there's currently no reliable screening test for ovarian cancer or prostate cancer. Read more about screening for prostate cancer. However, annual PSA tests for prostate cancer may benefit men who carry the faulty BRCA2 gene. Lifestyle changes Changes in your lifestyle can sometimes reduce your individual cancer risk. These include taking plenty of exercise and eating a healthy diet. If you have a faulty BRCA gene, be aware of other factors that could increase your risk of breast cancer. It's recommended that you avoid: the oral contraceptive pill if you are over 35 combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) if you\u2019re over 50 drinking more than the maximum recommended daily limits of alcohol being overweight The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also recommends that women with a family history of breast cancer breastfeed their children, if possible. Read about the things that may help to prevent ovarian cancer. Medication (chemoprevention) NICE has recommended treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene for a specific group of women who have a high risk of developing breast cancer. These medicines can reduce the risk of breast cancer for up to 20 years from five years of taking them. For more information, read the article: Drugs to be offered to women at high risk of breast cancer, which also explains the side effects these medicines can cause. Read the full NICE 2013 guidelines on familial breast cancer.   Risk-reducing surgery Risk-reducing surgery means removing all the tissue (such as the breasts or ovaries) that could become cancerous. Carriers of a faulty BRCA gene may wish to consider a preventative mastectomy.   Women who have risk-reducing mastectomies reduce their risk of developing breast cancer by around 90%. However, a mastectomy is a major operation and recovering from it can be physically and emotionally difficult. Surgery can also be used to reduce ovarian cancer risk. Women who have their ovaries removed before the menopause not only dramatically reduce their risk of developing ovarian cancer, but also reduce their risk of developing breast cancer by up to 50%. However, this will trigger an early menopause and mean you're not able to have your own children (unless you store eggs or embryos). Read more about surgery to remove the ovaries, including the risks and after-effects. The risk of ovarian cancer in women who carry a BRCA gene fault does not begin to rise significantly until about the age of 40. Therefore, carriers of the faulty gene who are younger than 40 usually wait to have this operation. Telling close relatives   Your genetics unit will not approach your relatives about your result \u2013 it will usually be up to you to tell your family. You may be given a standard letter to share with relatives, which explains your test result and contains all the information they need to be referred for the test themselves. However, not everyone will want to have the genetic test. Women who are closely related to you (such as your sister or daughter) can have cancer screening without having genetic testing. Planning a family  Cancer risk genes can be passed on to any children you have. If your predictive genetic test is positive and you want to start a family, you have several options. You can: Have your children without any intervention, and risk your child inheriting the faulty gene. Adopt a baby. Use donor eggs or donor sperm (depending on who carries the faulty gene) to avoid passing on the faulty gene. Have prenatal testing, which is a test done in pregnancy that reveals whether your baby has the faulty gene. You can then plan to continue or terminate the pregnancy, depending on the test result. Have pre-implantation genetic diagnosis \u2013 a technique used to select embryos that have not inherited the faulty gene. However, there is no guarantee this technique will result in a successful pregnancy, and funding for it on the NHS may not be available to all patients. Paying for private testing If there isn't a strong family history of cancer in your family and the faulty gene hasn't otherwise been identified in any of your relatives, you won't be eligible for the NHS genetic test. You'll have to pay for it privately if you still wish to have the test. Consider this carefully, because: if you don't have any family history of cancer, it's unlikely you have one of the faulty genes the tests can be expensive, potentially costing up to £500-2,000 or more there's no guarantee they will predict whether you'll develop cancer you may not be offered genetic counselling to help you make a decision and support you once you get your results About BRCA1 and BRCA2 If you have a fault (mutation) in one of the BRCA genes, your risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer is greatly increased.   Women with the faulty BRCA1 gene, for example, have a 60-90% lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 40-60% risk of ovarian cancer. In other words, out of every 100 women with the faulty BRCA1 gene, between 60 and 90 will develop breast cancer in their lifetime and between 40 and 60 will develop ovarian cancer. The faulty BRCA genes affect around 1 in every 400 people, but people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are at a much higher risk (as many as 1 in 40 may carry the faulty gene). For more information, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust has produced a beginner's guide to BRCA1 and BRCA2 (PDF, 867kb).

In 2011, just under 50,000 women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Most women who get it (8 out of 10) are over 50, but younger women, and in rare cases, men, can also get breast cancer. If it's treated early enough, breast cancer can be prevented from spreading to other parts of the body. The breasts The breasts are made up of fat, connective tissue and thousands of tiny glands called lobules, which produce milk. When a woman has a baby, the milk is delivered to the nipple through tiny tubes called ducts, which allow her to breastfeed. The body is made up of billions of tiny cells, which usually grow and multiply in an orderly way. New cells are only produced when and where they're needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably. Read more about the causes of breast cancer. Symptoms of breast cancer Breast cancer can have a number of symptoms, but the first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue. Most breast lumps aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by your doctor. You should also see your GP if you notice any of the following: a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts discharge from either of your nipples (which may be streaked with blood) a lump or swelling in either of your armpits dimpling on the skin of your breasts a rash on or around your nipple a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast Breast pain isn't usually a symptom of breast cancer. Learn more about the symptoms of breast cancer. After examining your breasts, your GP may refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests. This might include a mammography (breast screening) or a biopsy. Read more about breast screening and how breast cancer is diagnosed. Types of breast cancer There are several different types of breast cancer, which can develop in different parts of the breast. Breast cancer is often divided into non-invasive and invasive types. Non-invasive breast cancer Non-invasive breast cancer is also known as cancer or carcinoma in situ. This cancer is found in the ducts of the breast and hasn't developed the ability to spread outside the breast. This form of cancer rarely shows as a lump in the breast that can be felt, and is usually found on a mammogram (see below). The most common type of non-invasive cancer is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Invasive breast cancer Invasive cancer has the ability to spread outside the breast, although this doesn't necessarily mean it has spread. The most common form of breast cancer is invasive ductal breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the breast ducts. Invasive ductal breast cancer accounts for about 80% of all breast cancer cases and is sometimes called \"no special type\". Other types of breast cancer Other less common types of breast cancer include invasive lobular breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the milk-producing lobules, inflammatory breast cancer and Paget's disease of the breast. It's possible for breast cancer to spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymph nodes (small glands that filter bacteria from the body) or the bloodstream. If this happens, it's known as \"secondary\" or \"metastatic\" breast cancer. Breast cancer screening About one in eight women are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. There's a good chance of recovery if it's detected in its early stages. For this reason, it's vital that women check their breasts regularly for any changes and always get any changes examined by their GP. Mammographic screening (where X-ray images of the breast are taken) is the best available method of detecting an early breast lesion. However, you should be aware that a mammogram might fail to detect some breast cancers. It might also increase your chances of having extra tests and interventions, including surgery. Women with a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer may be offered screening and genetic testing for the condition. As the risk of breast cancer increases with age, all women who are 50-70 years old are invited for breast cancer screening every three years. Women over 70 are also entitled to screening and can arrange an appointment through their GP or local screening unit. The NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47-73. Read more about breast screening and find breast cancer screening services near you. Treating breast cancer If cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads to nearby parts of the body. Breast cancer is treated using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgery is usually the first type of treatment you'll have, followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments. The type of surgery and the treatment you have afterwards will depend on the type of breast cancer you have. Your doctor will discuss the best treatment plan with you. Read a document listing the one-year net survival estimates by CCG for breast cancer In a small proportion of women, breast cancer is discovered after it's spread to other parts of the body (metastasis). Secondary cancer, also called advanced or metastatic cancer, isn't curable, so the aim of treatment is to achieve remission (symptom relief). Read more about treating breast cancer. How well your local NHS performs Clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) are NHS organisations that organise the delivery of NHS services in England. They play a major role in achieving good health outcomes for the local population that they serve. You can now check how your local CCG compares against others for breast cancer survival (PDF, 900 Kb). Preventing breast cancer As the causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood, it's not possible to know if it can be prevented altogether. If you're at increased risk of developing the condition, some treatments are available to reduce the risk. Studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions, there are benefits for women who maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly and who have a low intake of saturated fat and alcohol. It's been suggested that regular exercise can reduce your risk of breast cancer by as much as a third. If you've been through the menopause, it's particularly important that you're not overweight or obese. This is because being overweight or obese causes more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer. Read more about preventing breast cancer. Living with breast cancer Being diagnosed with breast cancer can affect daily life in many ways, depending on what stage it's at and what treatment you're having. How women cope with their diagnosis and treatment varies from person to person. You can be reassured that there are several forms of support available, if you need it. For example: your family and friends can be a powerful support system you can communicate with other people in the same situation find out as much as possible about your condition don't try to do too much or overexert yourself make time for yourself Read more about living with breast cancer.

It's much less common in men than women, with only around 1 new case of breast cancer diagnosed for every 100,000 men (about 350 to 400 cases) in the UK each year.   The cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts. However, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition called gynaecomastia. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged. Breast cancer in men can also cause nipple problems, such as the nipple turning in on itself (retraction) or nipple discharge. Read more about the symptoms of male breast cancer. When to see your GP You should always talk to your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have problems affecting your nipples, such as discharge. While these symptoms are unlikely to be caused by breast cancer, they should be investigated further.  Why it happens The cause of male breast cancer is unclear, but factors known to increase your chances of developing the condition include: age \u2013 most cases affect men over the age of 60 having a family history of breast cancer (male or female) obesity \u2013 a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more Read more about causes of breast cancer in men. Treating breast cancer in men In most cases, surgery is used to remove the cancer, along with a section of the breast. This may be followed by a long-term course of hormone-blocking therapy using medication, usually a drug called tamoxifen. Tamoxifen helps block the effects of hormones known to stimulate the growth of cancerous cells in breast tissue. It should help prevent the cancer returning. In some cases, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used for the same purpose. Read more about treating breast cancer in men. Outlook The outlook for breast cancer is not as good in men as in women. This is because there's reduced awareness of the condition and it may take longer to diagnose. The survival rates for breast cancer in men largely depend on how far the cancer has spread before it's diagnosed. Breast cancer diagnosed at an early stage can often be treated successfully, but effective treatment is more difficult if the cancer has spread beyond the breast tissue. Unfortunately, many cases are diagnosed after the cancer has already started to spread. Read more about diagnosing breast cancer in men. Reducing your risk The most effective way of reducing your risk of developing breast cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, is to: drink alcohol in moderation \u2013 men are advised to drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week; a unit is approximately half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits maintain a healthy weight \u2013 through a combination of eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly Read more about preventing cancer.

Breast screening aims to find breast cancers early. It uses an X-ray test called a mammogram that can spot cancers when they are too small to see or feel. Breast screening does, however, have some risks you should be aware of (see below). As the likelihood of getting breast cancer increases with age, all women who are aged 50-70 and registered with a GP are automatically invited for breast cancer screening every three years. In the meantime, if you are worried about breast cancer symptoms, such as a lump or area of thickened tissue in a breast, don't wait to be offered screening \u2013 see your GP. This page gives an overview of breast cancer screening, with links to information on why and when it is offered, what happens when you go for breast screening, and receiving your results. Why is breast screening offered? Most experts agree that regular breast screening is beneficial in identifying breast cancer early. The earlier the condition is found, the better the chances of surviving it. You're also less likely to need a mastectomy (breast removal) or chemotherapy if breast cancer is detected at an early stage. The main risk is that breast screening sometimes picks up cancers that may not have caused any symptoms or become life-threatening. You may end up having unnecessary extra tests and treatment. Read about the pros and cons of breast cancer screening. When will I be offered breast screening? Breast screening is currently offered to women aged 50-70 in England. However, the NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47-73. You will first be invited for screening between your 50th and 53rd birthday, although in some areas you'll be invited from the age of 47 as part of the trial extension of the programme. You may be eligible for breast screening before the age of 50 if you have a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer (for more information, read 'If you have a family history of breast cancer'). If you're over the age of 70, you'll stop receiving screening invitations. However, you're still eligible for screening and can arrange an appointment by contacting your local screening unit. For more information, read when breast cancer screening is offered. Find breast screening units in your area. What happens during breast screening? Breast screening is carried out at special clinics or mobile breast screening units. The procedure is carried out by female members of staff who take mammograms. During screening, your breasts will be X-rayed one at a time. The breast is placed on the X-ray machine and gently but firmly compressed with a clear plate. Two X-rays are taken of each breast at different angles. For more information, read what happens during breast cancer screening.  When will I receive my results? After your breasts have been X-rayed, the mammogram will be checked for any abnormalities. The results of the mammogram will be sent to you and your GP no later than two weeks after your appointment. Following screening, about one in 25 women will be called back for further assessment. Being called back doesn't mean you definitely have cancer. The first mammogram may have been unclear. About one in four women who are called back for further assessment are diagnosed with breast cancer. Read our page on understanding your results.

Some of the main causes of nipple discharge are described below. See your GP if you're unsure of the cause of your discharge or you're embarrassed or worried, especially if the discharge is bloodstained or clear and only comes from one nipple, or if you're a man with nipple discharge. Pregnancy For women, one of the most obvious explanations for fluid leaking from the nipple is that you're pregnant or currently breastfeeding, as this can cause a milky discharge to come from both nipples. In pregnancy, the breasts may start to produce milk from as early as the second trimester, and some women continue to produce milk up to two years after stopping breastfeeding. If you think you may be pregnant, you can do a pregnancy test. You may also find the article Am I pregnant? helpful. Non-pregnancy causes If pregnancy has been ruled out, it's likely that your nipple discharge is caused by one of the following conditions: duct papilloma \u2013 a harmless growth inside your breast duct (the tube that carries milk from the gland to the nipple) that typically causes bloodstained discharge from one breast duct ectasia \u2013 a harmless, age-related breast change that can result in a cheesy or discoloured discharge from both breasts  breast or nipple abscess \u2013 a painful collection of pus forming in the breast tissue or around the nipple, usually as a result of bacterial infection These conditions are explained in more detail below, to give you a better idea of whether you may be affected. However, it's important to see your GP for a proper diagnosis so a more serious cause such as breast cancer can be ruled out. Duct papilloma If the discharge is bloodstained and from a single breast, the cause is likely to be a duct papilloma. A papilloma is a harmless wart-like growth, usually about 1-2cm in size, found inside one of the breast ducts. The papilloma is usually just behind the nipple and can cause fluid or blood to seep out of the nipple.  You'll usually just have one papilloma, and a simple procedure to remove it will often be recommended. Although the discharge may be alarming, rest assured that papilloma is not cancer and is very unlikely to turn into cancer. Duct ectasia If the discharge is brown, green or cheesy, it's likely you have a harmless condition called duct ectasia. Duct ectasia tends to affect women approaching the menopause. As the breasts age, the milk ducts behind the nipple get shorter and wider, and may produce a discharge. This is a normal, age-related change and nothing to worry about. A lump can sometimes be felt behind the nipple, which is just scar tissue or perhaps a dilated duct, and the nipple sometimes becomes inverted. This condition is harmless and tends to clear up without treatment. It doesn't increase your risk of developing breast cancer in the future. However, it's important to go back to your GP if you develop any new symptoms. An abscess If the discharge contains pus, the cause will probably be a breast abscess or abscess around the nipple. The surrounding skin will be red, warm and swollen. Breast abscesses are often linked to mastitis \u2013 a condition that causes breast pain and swelling (inflammation) and usually affects women who are breastfeeding. If you have been to see your GP because of mastitis, you may already have been given antibiotics. If your breast is still hard, red and painful, your GP should refer you to a specialist to check for a breast abscess. If the diagnosis is confirmed, a simple procedure to drain the abscess may be recommended. Read more about treating breast abscesses. More unusual causes Less common causes of nipple discharge are: the contraceptive pill \u2013 discharge can be a temporary side effect of starting the pill (some women also get breast tenderness and breast enlargement) fluctuating hormones from puberty or the menopause previous breastfeeding \u2013 some women continue to produce milk up to two years after they've stopped breastfeeding   stimulation of the nipples \u2013 for example, through sex medication that causes raised levels of the milk-producing hormone prolactin \u2013 this includes SSRI antidepressants and tranquillisers a type of non-cancerous brain tumour called a prolactinoma, which causes raised levels of prolactin a hormone problem \u2013 such as an underactive thyroid gland or Cushing's syndrome a clogged milk duct called a galactocele \u2013 which is usually associated with childbirth and can cause a milky or creamy discharge along with a painless lump an early form of breast cancer called carcinoma in situ, which is found inside the milk ducts and hasn't yet spread (it's usually picked up during breast cancer screening) Is it breast cancer? In the vast majority of cases, nipple discharge isn't a sign of breast cancer. However, discharge from the breast can very occasionally be a symptom of cancer, so it's not something you should ever ignore. Nipple discharge is more likely to be a symptom of cancer if: you also have a breast lump or changes to the skin of your breast the discharge is bloody and only comes from one nipple the discharge occurs without any pressure on your breast or nipple you're over 50 See your GP if you're worried you might have breast cancer. While this is unlikely, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis. Read more about the symptoms of breast cancer and how breast cancer is diagnosed.

What is gynaecomastia? Gynaecomastia (sometimes referred to as \"man boobs\") is a common condition that causes boys\u2019 and men\u2019s breasts to swell and become larger than normal. It is most common in teenage boys and older men. What are the signs of gynaecomastia? Signs vary from a small amount of extra tissue around the nipples to more prominent breasts. It can affect one or both breasts. Sometimes, the breast tissue can be tender or painful, but this isn\u2019t always the case. What causes gynaecomastia? Gynaecomastia can have several causes. Hormone imbalance Gynaecomastia can be caused by an imbalance between the sex hormones testosterone and oestrogen. Oestrogen causes breast tissue to grow. While all men produce some oestrogen, they usually have much higher levels of testosterone, which stops the oestrogen from causing breast tissue to grow. If the balance of hormones in the body changes, this can cause a man\u2019s breasts to grow. Sometimes, the cause of this imbalance is unknown. Obesity Some growth in breast tissue is not due to extra body fat from being overweight, so losing weight or doing more exercise may not improve the condition. However, a common reason for gynaecomastia is that being very overweight (obese) can increase levels of oestrogen, which can cause breast tissue to grow. Newborn baby boys Gynaecomastia can affect newborn baby boys, because oestrogen passes through the placenta from the mother to the baby. This is temporary and will disappear a few weeks after the baby is born. Puberty During puberty, boys\u2019 hormone levels vary. If the level of testosterone drops, oestrogen can cause breast tissue to grow. Many teenage boys have some degree of breast enlargement. Gynaecomastia at puberty usually clears up as boys get older and their hormone levels become more stable. Older age As men get older, they produce less testosterone. Older men also tend to have more body fat, and this can cause more oestrogen to be produced. These changes in hormone levels can lead to excess breast tissue growth. Other causes In rare cases, gynaecomastia can be caused by: side effects of medication \u2013 such as anti-ulcer drugs or medication for heart disease illegal drugs \u2013 such as cannabis or anabolic steroids drinking too much alcohol  a health abnormality \u2013 such as kidney failure or liver disease Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome (a rare genetic disorder) lumps or infection in the testicles Treatment for gynaecomastia If you\u2019re worried about breast tissue growth, see your GP. If your GP thinks treatment is needed, there are two types of treatment for gynaecomastia: surgery to remove the excess breast tissue medication to adjust a hormone imbalance Your GP can discuss the treatment options with you. Read more about male breast reduction surgery. Procedures such as breast reduction surgery are not usually available on the NHS, unless there is a clear medical need for them. For example, if you have had gynaecomastia for a long time, it has not responded to other treatments and it is causing you a lot of distress or pain, your GP may refer you to a plastic surgeon to discuss the possibility of surgery. Always see your GP if the area is very painful or there is an obvious lump. Sometimes, the lump may need to be removed. Gynaecomastia is not related to breast cancer, but if you're worried about breast swelling, see a GP. Read the answers to more questions about men\u2019s health.

It can be expensive, the results aren't guaranteed, and there are risks to weigh up. It involves inserting breast implants to increase the size of the breasts, change their shape, or make them more even. But before you go ahead, be absolutely sure about why you want them. Take time to reflect on your decision. It may help to read our article Is cosmetic surgery right for me? and to discuss it with your GP first. Read on to find out: How much does it cost? Where do I go? What does it involve? Choosing your implants  How long do breast implants last? Recovery Side effects to expect What could go wrong What to do if you have problems   More information How much does it cost? In the UK, breast implant surgery costs around £3,500-£7,000, plus the cost of any consultations or follow-up care that may not be included in the price. If there is a problem with the implant and it has to be removed, you'll usually need to pay for any replacement and further surgery yourself. Where do I go? If you're looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform the operation.  All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC. The CQC publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. Also, research the surgeon who is going to fit your breast implants. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor's fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many operations they've performed where there have been complications what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong their own patient satisfaction rates Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? Breast implant surgery is carried out under general anaesthetic. The operation involves: making a cut (incision) in the skin next to or below the breast positioning the implant \u2013 either between your breast tissue and chest muscle, or behind your chest muscle stitching the incision and covering it with a dressing The operation takes between 60 and 90 minutes. You may be able to go home the same day, but may need to stay in hospital overnight if the operation was scheduled late in the day. Pain relief is provided if you experience any discomfort afterwards. Choosing your implants The type of implants most commonly used in the UK are silicone gel, but saline implants are also available. Your surgeon should discuss with you what shape and type of implant is best for you, but below is a rough guide. Silicone gel implants These are filled with either soft or firm silicone gel. Implants filled with the firmer gel are called cohesive gel implants. Some have a polyurethane coating.  Pros: Generally less likely to wrinkle than saline implants. The soft type can give a natural feel. Polyurethane-coated ones are claimed to reduce the risk of capsular contracture and the implant rotating \u2013 see What could go wrong. Cons: If a soft gel implant ruptures, silicone could spread into your breast and cause siliconomas \u2013 see What could go wrong. This is much less of an issue if cohesive implants are used, but this firmer gel may not feel as natural. Polyurethane-coated ones may cause a temporary skin reaction. Saline solution implants  Pros: If the implant were to rupture, the saline solution would be safely absorbed or passed out of your body.   Cons: More likely to rupture or deflate earlier than silicone, as they tend to slowly deflate over time. More prone to wrinkling or folding. May feel less natural than soft silicone. Where to place them The implants can either be placed between the breast and the chest muscle or behind the muscle. You'll need to decide with your surgeon where is best for you, but here's a rough guide. Between the breast and the muscle: most natural location less discomfort immediately after the operation chest muscle is not damaged Under the muscle: extra tissue coverage less risk of rippling and capsular contracture \u2013 see What could go wrong How long do breast implants last? Breast implants will not last a lifetime. They are likely to need replacing at some point. Some women may need further surgery after about 10 years, either because of problems with the implants or because their breasts have changed around the implants. Recovery It can take a few weeks to fully recover from breast implant surgery. You may need to take a week or two off work and shouldn't drive for at least one week. Some surgeons recommend wearing a sports bra 24 hours a day for up to three months after breast surgery. You'd need to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous exercise for at least a month, and keep your breast scars out of direct sunlight for about a year. After a week or two: Stitches would be removed (unless you had dissolvable stitches). Within six weeks: You'd usually be able to return to most of your normal activities. After a few months: Your breasts would usually start to look and feel more natural. You may be able to stop wearing your sports bra. Side effects to expect It's fairly common after breast implant surgery to have:  temporary pain, swelling and bruising a tight feeling in your chest for a few weeks   What could go wrong Breast implants can occasionally result in problems, including: thick, obvious scarring the breast tissue feeling hard because scar tissue has shrunk around the implant (capsular contracture) a ruptured implant \u2013 this may cause small tender lumps (siliconomas) only detectable on breast scans, and the implant will need to be removed creases or folds in the implant the implant rotating within the breast, which may lead to an abnormal shape 'rippling' of the implant \u2013 this occurs when the implant is covered by only a thin layer of tissue, which sticks to the implant surface and is very difficult to treat nerve problems in the nipples \u2013 they may become more sensitive, less sensitive, or completely desensitised; this can be temporary or permanent not being able to breastfeed or producing slightly less breast milk than you would without implants \u2013 your baby won't be harmed if you breastfeed with implants Also, any type of operation carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding infection \u2013 this is rare, but may mean the implant needs to be removed an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic a blood clot forming in the deep veins You should also be aware of a possible link between breast implants and a rare type of immune system cell cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). ALCL has been reported in a very small number of women who have had breast implants. So far, it has only been found in scar tissue that develops around textured breast implants. The surgeon should explain how likely all these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, people find the desired effect wasn't achieved and feel they need another operation. Mammograms after implants Mammograms for breast cancer screening are less accurate if you have implants, so it's important you tell the radiographer about them. It's safe to have mammograms and they do not cause implants to rupture. They may reveal an implant that has ruptured. What to do if you have problems Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms, such as redness of your breast skin, a burning sensation or unusual swelling. If you experience a problem with your breast implants, you can report this through the government's Yellow Card Scheme. By reporting any issues, you are helping to provide more information on the safety of the implants. If you are not happy with the results or think the procedure wasn't carried out properly, you should take up the matter with your surgeon through the hospital or clinic where you were treated. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC). Breast implant registry By June 2016, everyone who has a breast enlargement operation in England will be able to have their breast implants recorded on a national registry.  This measure has been introduced following the 2010 PIP implant scandal, when many women were unable to find out whether they had been given the faulty implants. This registry is designed to capture all breast implant surgery carried out both privately and by the NHS, so patients can be easily traced if implants ever need to be recalled and removed. Talk to your surgeon if you want data about your implants to be stored. Find out more about the registry.

Whether you're considering a less invasive procedure like Botox or full cosmetic surgery like breast implants, it's a good idea to do your research. You can start by looking up the procedure in the list of information leaflets on this page, or browsing the menu tabs. All cosmetic procedures carry some level of risk. Cosmetic surgery has greater risks than non-surgical procedures. It's important you choose a practitioner or surgeon who is competent to perform the procedure and has the appropriate insurance. Also, make sure you weigh up the costs, as it's unusual for cosmetic surgery to be available on the NHS. You should factor in any additional costs for aftercare and future surgery, and correcting anything that goes wrong. If you're sure you want to go ahead with surgery, you'll need to choose a surgeon and hospital for your procedure and follow the steps from there. Why has this guide been produced? In recent years there has been a sharp rise in the number of men and women opting for cosmetic surgery and less invasive procedures such as Botox and fillers. Worryingly, this comes at a time when an independent review in 2013 (PDF, 1.38Mb) highlighted serious concerns about the cosmetic procedures industry.  The review proposed much tighter and rigorous regulation for non-surgical cosmetic procedures, and made a number of other recommendations to ensure patient safety.  It also stressed the importance of having accurate information and advice available for patients. That's why this NHS Choices guide to cosmetic procedures has been created. This guide should help you understand the risks and effectiveness of different cosmetic procedures, and ultimately help you decide whether cosmetic surgery is right for you.  Making improvements The government welcomed the review (PDF, 1.9Mb) and accepted most of the recommendations to ensure patient safety. The Department of Health has been working with key organisations to implement these recommendations. Improvements are now being made. Doctors who carry out cosmetic procedures anywhere in the UK have been issued with new guidance by the General Medical Council (GMC) to make sure they provide the best possible care for patients. The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) has also developed professional standards for all surgeons who perform cosmetic surgery. And the RCS will soon be introducing a new cosmetic surgery certification system. This means you will be able to find a surgeon who meets RCS standards for the procedure you are interested in, if you're sure you want to go ahead.

Research hasn't found any evidence to suggest that PIP implants pose a serious health risk, but they can cause unpleasant symptoms if they rupture, and you may be anxious about leaving them in. If you have PIP implants, you should discuss with a surgeon whether they should be taken out. The implants don't necessarily need to be removed, but they should be taken out if they rupture or you're worried about this happening. This page covers: What are PIP implants? Risks of PIP implants How to find out if you have PIP implants What to do if you have PIP implants Removing and replacing PIP implants What are PIP implants? PIP implants are silicone breast implants containing unapproved silicone gel. They were manufactured in France by a company called Poly Implant Prostheses (PIP). The concerns relate to all breast implants manufactured by PIP.  It's estimated that around 47,000 British women had PIP implants fitted, most of whom are still living with them. The vast majority of PIP implants were fitted in private clinics, but a small number were done on the NHS, mostly for breast reconstruction after breast cancer. Risks of PIP implants PIP implants are two to six times more likely to rupture than standard silicone implants. This doesn't pose a serious risk to your health, but it can cause some unpleasant symptoms. See your GP if you have signs of a rupture, such as: lumpiness or swelling in and around the breast   a change in the shape of the breast redness pain and tenderness a burning sensation enlarged lymph nodes in the armpit Ruptured PIP implants have no proven long-term health effects. British and European researchers have so far not found any evidence to suggest that the ingredients in the implants can cause cancer or are toxic. See the British expert review group's final report (PDF, 163kb) and the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) report (PDF, 963kb) for more information. How to find out if you have PIP implants You may have been given details about your breast implants when they were fitted. This will often include information about the manufacturer of your implants. If you don't have these details, you can ask for them from the clinic or hospital where the implants were fitted. The medical notes kept by your GP may also include this information. Most women who had PIP implants fitted on the NHS should already have received a letter telling them about it and advising them what to do. What to do if you have PIP implants You should get medical advice if you have PIP implants. If the implants were fitted on the NHS, your GP can arrange for you to see an NHS specialist. If they were fitted privately, contact the clinic. If they were fitted privately and the clinic is unable or unwilling to help, speak to your GP about seeing an NHS specialist. You should have an ultrasound scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to check whether your implants have ruptured. A ruptured implant should be removed as soon as possible. If there are no signs of a rupture, talk to your surgeon about the benefits and risks of taking the implants out or leaving them in. If you're concerned about leaving them in, removing them will usually be recommended. If you decide to keep them in, you should look out for signs of a rupture and have a yearly check-up with your doctor to make sure the implants are still intact. Removing and replacing PIP implants Some private clinics have agreed to remove and replace PIP breast implants free of charge, while others charge a fee. The following clinics have said they will replace PIP implants for free if medically necessary: BMI Healthcare HCA International The Holly Private Hospital Highgate Hospital Make Yourself Amazing\/MYA Cosmetic Surgery Nuffield Health Ramsay Health Care Spire Healthcare If the clinic where you had your implants fitted won't help you because it has closed or is unwilling to do so, you can have your implants removed free of charge on the NHS. However, the NHS in England won't provide replacement implants if your original implants were fitted privately, except in a very small number of cases where they were fitted for medical, rather than cosmetic, reasons. If you had PIP breast implants originally fitted on the NHS, you can have them removed and replaced by the NHS at no cost.

It's most common in breastfeeding women, usually within the first three months after giving birth. If mastitis is caused by breastfeeding, doctors may refer to it as lactation mastitis or puerperal mastitis. Non-breastfeeding women often have a type called periductal mastitis. Symptoms of mastitis Mastitis usually only affects one breast, and symptoms often develop quickly. Symptoms of mastitis can include: a red, swollen area on your breast that may feel hot and painful to touch a breast lump or area of hardness on your breast a burning pain in your breast that may be continuous or may only occur when you are breastfeeding nipple discharge, which may be white or contain streaks of blood You may also experience flu-like symptoms, such as aches, a high temperature (fever), chills and tiredness. When to seek medical advice Contact your GP as soon as possible if you think you might have mastitis. It may help to try some self-help measures before your appointment. It's important to see your GP promptly as mastitis could lead to a painful collection of pus (breast abscess), which may need to be drained surgically. Causes of mastitis In breastfeeding women, mastitis is often caused by a build-up of milk within the breast. This is known as milk stasis. Milk stasis can occur for a number of reasons, including: a baby not properly attaching to the breast during feeding a baby having problems sucking infrequent feeds or missing feeds In some cases, this build-up of milk can also become infected with bacteria. This is known as infective mastitis. In non-breastfeeding women, mastitis most often occurs when the breast becomes infected as a result of damage to the nipple, such as a cracked or sore nipple, or a nipple piercing. Read more about the causes of mastitis. Diagnosing mastitis Your GP can often diagnose mastitis based on your symptoms and an examination of your breasts. If you're breastfeeding, they may ask you to show them how you breastfeed. Try not to feel as if you're being tested or blamed \u2013 it can take time and practise to breastfeed correctly. Your GP may request a small sample of your breast milk for testing if: your symptoms are particularly severe you've had recurrent episodes of mastitis you've been given antibiotics and your condition hasn't improved This will help determine whether you have a bacterial infection and allow your GP to prescribe an effective antibiotic. If you have mastitis and aren't breastfeeding, your GP should refer you to hospital for a specialist examination and a breast scan to rule out other conditions, particularly if your symptoms haven't improved after a few days of treatment. Scans you may have include an ultrasound scan or a mammogram (X-ray of the breast). Treating mastitis Mastitis can usually be easily treated and most women make a full recovery very quickly. Self-help measures are often helpful, such as: getting plenty of rest and staying well hydrated using over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to reduce any pain or fever avoiding tight-fitting clothing \u2013 including bras \u2013 until your symptoms improve if you're breastfeeding, continuing to feed your baby and making sure they are properly attached to your breast Breastfeeding your baby when you have mastitis, even if you have an infection, won't harm your baby and can help improve your symptoms. It may also help to feed more frequently than usual, express any remaining milk after a feed, and express milk between feeds. For non-breastfeeding women with mastitis and breastfeeding women with a suspected infection, a course of antibiotic tablets will usually be prescribed to bring the infection under control. Read more about treating mastitis. Preventing mastitis Although mastitis can usually be treated easily, the condition can recur if the underlying cause isn't addressed. If you're breastfeeding, you can help reduce your risk of developing mastitis by taking steps to stop milk building up in your breasts, such as: breastfeed exclusively for around six months, if possible encourage your baby to feed frequently, particularly when your breasts feel overfull ensure your baby is well attached to your breast during feeds \u2013 ask for advice if you're unsure let your baby finish their feeds \u2013 most babies release the breast when they've finished feeding; try not to take your baby off the breast unless they're finished avoid suddenly going longer between feeds \u2013 if possible, cut down gradually avoid pressure on your breasts from tight clothing, including bras Your GP, midwife or health visitor can advise about how to improve your breastfeeding technique. You can also call the National Breastfeeding Helpline on 0300 100 0212 for advice.

Although most lumps aren't breast cancer, any unusual changes to the breasts should be checked by a GP as soon as possible. If your GP finds a lump on examination, they will routinely refer you to be seen by a hospital specialist. There are several types of benign (non-cancerous) breast lump, most of which are harmless and are caused by hormonal changes that occur at different times in a woman's life, such as during the menstrual cycle. Common types of benign breast lump include: a fibroadenoma \u2013 a firm lump that moves around easily in the breast and is more common in younger women a breast cyst \u2013 a smooth, firm fluid-filled lump most commonly seen in women aged 30 to 60 a breast abscess \u2013 a painful collection of pus that forms under the skin of the breast, usually as the result of a bacterial infection Read more about the causes of breast lumps. Checking your breasts It's important to be \"breast aware\" so you can identify any problems in your breasts and get them checked out as soon as possible. This means being familiar with your breasts and what is normal for them, and examining them regularly for any changes. If you are 50 years or over, it's also important to attend breast cancer screening appointments every three years, where a type of X-ray called a mammogram will be carried out to look for early signs of cancer. But don't wait until your next screening appointment if you notice any problems in your breast. See your GP right away. Seeing your GP It is important you see your GP as soon as possible if you notice a lump in your breasts so a cause can be confirmed. Finding a lump in your breast can be a worry, but around 90% of breast lumps are benign. You also should see your GP if you notice any other changes to one or both of your breasts, such as: an area of thickened tissue nipple discharge, which may contain blood a change in the size or shape of your breasts dimpling on the skin of your breasts a rash on or around your nipples a change in your nipple's appearance \u2013 for example, becoming sunken into your breast persistent pain in your breasts or armpits a lump or swelling in your armpits Your GP will ask you about your symptoms and will then ask your permission to examine your breasts. You should also be asked whether you'd like another staff member \u2013 such as a practice nurse \u2013 to be present while your breast is being examined. Further tests Your GP may then refer you for further tests, such as an ultrasound scan and mammogram, to determine the cause. Being referred for further testing can be scary, but it does not necessarily mean your GP thinks you have breast cancer. Most people who have these further tests are eventually found to have a benign condition. Read more about diagnosing breast lumps. How breast lumps are treated Benign breast lumps do not necessarily require any treatment, although treatment may be recommended if the lump is particularly large, is getting bigger, or is causing other symptoms such as pain. Medication can often help relieve breast pain, and antibiotics can treat any bacterial infections that may have caused the lump to develop. In some cases, a needle may need to be used to drain away any fluid or pus within the breast lump. Local anaesthetic will be used to numb the area being treated so you don't feel any pain while this is carried out. Occasionally, surgery may be carried out to cut out the lump. This will normally be done under general anaesthetic (where you are asleep) and you will usually be able to go home the same day.

Breast pain may be felt as a heaviness or soreness, and has also been described as a stabbing or burning pain. It's usually felt in the upper, outer area of your breasts and may extend from your breasts to your armpits, and sometimes down your arms. Many women worry that breast pain may be a sign of a serious condition. However, breast pain by itself is not a symptom of breast cancer, and breast pain does not increase your risk of developing breast cancer. In most cases, breast pain is relatively mild, although some women experience moderate or severe pain. Severe or chronic breast pain can interfere with daily activities and lead to stress, anxiety or depression. Types of breast pain There are two types of breast pain: cyclical breast pain \u2013 the most common type of breast pain, linked to the menstrual cycle non-cyclical breast pain \u2013 pain in the breasts unrelated to the menstrual cycle Causes of breast pain Cyclical breast pain Although the exact cause of cyclical breast pain is unknown, it's thought to be linked to the changes in hormone levels before periods begin. The menstrual cycle is controlled by your body releasing hormones such as oestrogen. Hormones are powerful chemicals that have a wide range of effects on the body. The pain occurs around the same time every month, usually one to three days before the start of your period, and improves at the end of your period. The intensity of the pain will not always be the same. Although cyclical breast pain mainly affects women who are still having periods (before the menopause), some women can experience symptoms after the menopause if they undergo hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Cyclical breast pain is not associated with any other breast-related conditions. Non-cyclical breast pain In many cases, the cause of non-cyclical breast pain can't be identified. However, breast pain is sometimes caused by other conditions, including: mastitis \u2013 a condition that can be related to breastfeeding and causes the breast tissue to become painful and swollen breast lumps \u2013 there are many non-cancerous (benign) causes of breast lumps, some of which may be painful breast abscess \u2013 a painful collection of pus that forms in the breast Non-cyclical breast pain may also be the result of an injury elsewhere in the body, such as pulling a muscle in the chest, which is felt in the breast. In rare cases, non-cyclical breast pain may be caused by other medications and treatments \u2013 such as some types of antifungal medicines, antidepressants or antipsychotics \u2013 that are used to treat mental health conditions. When to see your GP Visit your GP if you notice changes to your breasts, such as: a lump or area of thickened tissue in either breast discharge from either of your nipples (which may be streaked with blood) a lump or swelling in either of your armpits a change in the size or shape of one or both of your breasts dimpling on the skin of your breasts a rash on or around your nipple a change in the appearance of your nipple \u2013 for example, it becomes sunken into your breast pain in either of your breasts or armpits that is not related to your period any symptoms of an infection in your breast, such as swelling, redness or warmth in your breast, or a high temperature (fever) You should also see your GP if you have any symptoms of pregnancy, such as a missed period. If you have breast pain alongside other symptoms, or the pain continues throughout your menstrual cycle (not only around your period), it may not be cyclical breast pain. Your GP can advise you on what the cause may be. Your GP will be able to diagnose cyclical breast pain by asking about your symptoms and your general health. They may also examine your breasts if they feel lumpy when you experience breast pain. Recording breast pain You may be asked to record your breast pain, if it's severe. Completing a breast pain chart may help to diagnose whether it's cyclical breast pain and to plan appropriate treatment. The chart will usually have a series of small boxes, with the month and date next to each one. You fill in the box for each day of the month to indicate your level of pain. This is usually done for at least two months. How is breast pain treated? Most cases of breast pain get better without treatment. Almost a third of women with cyclical breast pain find their condition gets better in around three menstrual cycles. However, for many, cyclical breast pain will return in the future. Many women find they can live with their breast pain once they feel reassured that it's not caused by breast cancer. The pain can usually be dealt with by over-the-counter painkillers and gels, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. Speak to your pharmacist for advice. If your breast pain is caused by another condition, such as a breast abscess, the pain should ease once the condition is treated. If your breast pain is affecting your quality of life, your GP may request that you keep a record of your daily pain and may refer you to a breast specialist for further treatment.

If you're feeling very distressed over the size of your breasts or they're causing physical symptoms such as backache, you may be able to have a breast reduction on the NHS. But if you're considering a breast reduction operation to change your appearance, rather than for health reasons, you'll need to pay for it privately.

What does it involve?  Afterwards  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems  If you're planning to have children  More information  How much does it cost? In the UK, breast reduction surgery costs around £6,500, plus the cost of any consultations or follow-up care that may not be included in the price. Where do I go? If you're looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for providers that can perform breast reductions.  All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC. The CQC publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. Also, research the surgeon who is going to carry out the operation. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor's fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many operations they've performed where there have been complications what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong their own patient satisfaction rates Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? Breast reduction surgery is carried out under general anaesthetic. There are several techniques the surgeon could use, but generally the operation involves: moving your nipple to its new position \u2013 usually while it's still attached to the blood supply removing excess fat, glandular tissue and skin from your breasts reshaping the remaining breast tissue Most women are left with a scar around the nipple. With some surgical techniques, the scar will also run down vertically and horizontally across the breast crease (anchor-shaped), or just run down vertically to the breast crease. The operation takes between 90 minutes and 4 hours, depending on the extent of the breast reduction. You usually need to stay in hospital for one or two nights. Afterwards When you wake up after surgery, you will have dressings on your breasts and plastic tubes may be attached to them to drain blood away. After one to two days, any tubes would be removed and you will usually be able to go home. Some women experience pain for a few days, which can be relieved with painkillers. It's likely your breasts will be swollen and feel tender and lumpy after surgery. Recovery It can take two to six weeks to fully recover from breast reduction surgery. You may need to take a week or two off work and shouldn't drive for at least a week. The final appearance of your breasts may not be obvious for several weeks or months after the operation. Some surgeons recommend wearing a sports bra 24 hours a day for up to three months after breast surgery. The length of time you need to keep the dressings on depends on how quickly your wounds healed. Stitches are removed after a week or two, unless they are dissolvable. You should avoid stretching, strenuous exercise and heavy lifting for up to six weeks after the operation. You can drive again when it's no longer painful to wear a seatbelt, which may be several weeks. Side effects to expect It's typical after breast reduction surgery to have: sore breasts for a few weeks up to three scars \u2013 one around the nipple, and sometimes another one vertically from the nipple to the crease below the breast, and sometimes a third scar along the crease below the breast Scars are usually quite red for the first six weeks, but most fade over time and should be invisible under normal clothing, bras and bikini tops.

Occasionally, people find the desired effect wasn't achieved and feel they need another operation. What to do if you have problems Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms, such as redness of your breast skin, a burning sensation or unusual swelling. If you have breast reduction surgery and are not happy with the results or think the procedure wasn't carried out properly, you should take up the matter with your surgeon through the hospital or clinic where you were treated. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC). If you're planning to have children If you plan to have breast reduction surgery before having children, or more children, bear in mind that breasts can get larger again during pregnancy and this may affect the results of the operation. Also, there's a chance you wouldn't be able to breastfeed after the operation.

But if it's done to improve appearance rather than for health reasons, it's not normally available on the NHS. Instead, you'll need to pay for the procedure privately. Information about breast reduction for cosmetic reasons is provided elsewhere \u2013 read about cosmetic breast reduction for women and male breast reduction. This page focuses on when breast reduction might be available on the NHS. It covers: Eligibility criteria Referral process Things to consider Alternatives to surgery Male breast reduction on the NHS Links to more information Eligibility criteria for NHS breast reduction The availability of breast reduction surgery on the NHS varies, depending on the eligibility criteria decided by your local clinical commissioning group (CCG). Some CCGs do not fund breast reduction surgery at all and others fund it selectively if you fulfil certain criteria. Generally speaking, you might be considered for breast reduction on the NHS if you have problems caused by having very large breasts, such as: backache  shoulder or neck pain skin irritation rashes and skin infections under the breasts grooves on the shoulders from bra straps psychological distress, such as low self-esteem or depression an inability to exercise or take part in sports CCGs also tend to have additional criteria that may include the size of your breasts, your weight, your age, whether you smoke, and whether other options \u2013 such as wearing professionally fitted bras \u2013 have been tried, but haven't helped. You can find out what the eligibility criteria are in your area from your GP or by contacting your local CCG. The referral process See your GP if you think you might be eligible for breast reduction surgery on the NHS. They can check whether you meet the criteria of your local CCG, and if you do, can refer you to a breast or plastic surgeon for an assessment. This may involve: asking about the problems you're experiencing checking your weight and general health an assessment by a psychiatrist or psychologist information about the risks and results of surgery The assessment will help determine whether you're suitable for surgery and whether there's a strong enough reason for this to be done on the NHS. The final decision is usually made by a panel of representatives from your local CCG, which will take into account the information from your assessments and review your individual case. Things to consider before you go ahead It's important to discuss your problems and options with your GP and an appropriately qualified surgeon before having a breast reduction. This will help you get a clear idea of what changes you can expect to see and ensure you're aware of any risks involved.

But for women with only moderately large breasts, the benefits may not be worth the risks. Alternatives to breast reduction surgery It's sometimes possible to reduce problems caused by having large breasts without the need for surgery. The following measures may help: lose weight \u2013 if you're overweight, losing weight can help reduce the amount of fatty tissue in your breasts a professional bra-fitting service \u2013 for many women with problems due to large breasts, getting a professional to fit a correctly-sized bra can reduce discomfort physiotherapy \u2013 exercises from a physiotherapist can sometimes help with aches and pains caused by large breasts psychological support and treatment \u2013 this can help if your large breasts are causing emotional or mental health issues Breast reduction surgery will usually only be available on the NHS if alternative measures such as these have been tried first. Male breast reduction on the NHS Male breast reduction isn't normally available on the NHS. This is because enlarged breasts in men are usually a result of being overweight, and losing weight will often help to reduce their size. You'll normally need to pay privately for breast reduction surgery in these cases. However, breast reduction on the NHS may sometimes be considered if it's caused by an underlying condition, or losing weight hasn't helped.

Known as gynaecomastia, this condition can result from a hormone imbalance or from being very overweight, which can increase levels of oestrogen and cause breast tissue to grow. Breast reduction surgery is an option for men with this condition. It may also be used to tighten the breast area after dramatic weight loss that has caused the skin to sag. However, it is not suitable for men whose large breasts are simply excess fat from being overweight. Normally, you'll need to pay for breast reduction surgery privately. But the NHS may provide this for you if you've had gynecomastia for a long time, it has not responded to other treatments, and it's causing you a lot of distress or pain. Read on to find out: How much does it cost to have privately?  Where do I go?  What does it involve?  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems  More information  How much does it cost to have privately? In the UK, breast reduction surgery for men costs £3,500-£5,500, plus the cost of any consultations or follow-up care that may not be included in the price. Where do I go? If you're looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for providers that can perform breast reductions for men.  All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC. The CQC publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. Also, research the surgeon who is going to carry out the operation. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor's fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many operations they've performed where there have been complications what sort of aftercare you will receive what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong, and who would pick up the costs if things go wrong their own patient satisfaction rates Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? Breast reduction surgery is usually carried out under general anaesthetic.  There are several techniques the surgeon could use, but generally the operation involves: making a cut (incision) around the nipple using liposuction to suck out excess fatty tissue extending the cuts and repositioning the nipples if there is a lot of tissue to remove The operation takes about 90 minutes. You usually need to stay in hospital overnight. Recovery It can take a few weeks to fully recover from breast reduction surgery. You may need to take a few days off work. It can take up to six months to see the full results. You will need to wear an elastic garment day and night for a few weeks after the operation. The length of time you need to keep the dressings on depends on how quickly your wounds heal. After one or two weeks, your stitches will either dissolve or be removed at an outpatient clinic. You should avoid stretching, strenuous exercise and heavy lifting for up to six weeks after the operation. You can drive again when it's no longer painful to wear a seatbelt, which may be several weeks. Side effects to expect It's typical after breast reduction surgery to have: sore breasts for a few weeks scars \u2013 these may take several months to fade Most men are just left with a scar around the nipple. But a large breast reduction operation may also result in a scar that runs down vertically and horizontally across the breast crease. What could go wrong Breast reduction surgery can occasionally result in problems, including: thick, obvious scarring unevenly shaped breasts or nipples wound healing problems  loss of nipple sensation bleeding inside the breast tissue (haematoma) \u2013 this generally occurs within the first 24 hours after the operation developing lumps, bruising or swelling Also, any type of operation carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic a blood clot forming in the deep veins The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. What to do if you have problems Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong, and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms, such as redness of your breast skin, a burning sensation or unusual swelling. If you have breast reduction surgery and are not happy with the results or think the procedure wasn't carried out properly, you should take up the matter with your surgeon through the hospital or clinic where you were treated.

How will breastfeeding help me bond with my baby? (0-9 months) Media last reviewed: 27\/01\/2015 Next review due: 27\/01\/2017 In the first few days, you and your baby will be getting to know each other. It may take time for both of you to get the hang of breastfeeding. This happens more quickly for some women than others. But nearly all women can produce the amount of milk their baby needs. Preparing for breastfeeding before the birth It\u2019s good to find out as much as you can about breastfeeding before the birth. Knowing what to expect should help you feel as confident as possible when you've just given birth and want to breastfeed your baby. Antenatal sessions, whether held by the NHS or another organisation, should cover the most important aspects of breastfeeding, such as positioning and attachment, expressing, common questions and concerns, and how to overcome them. You can find out more from your midwife, from family and friends, and useful helplines and websites. There are lots of groups and drop-ins, some specially designed for pregnant women who want to know more about breastfeeding. You can find out more by asking your midwife, health visitor, local peer supporter or GP. Or visit your local Children\u2019s Centre. Skin-to-skin contact Having skin-to-skin contact with your baby straight after the birth will help to keep your baby close, warm and calm, and steady their breathing. Skin-to-skin time can be a bonding experience for mum and baby. It's also a great time to start your first breastfeed because your baby will be alert and keen to feed. If you need any help, your midwife will offer support with positioning and attachment. Your baby will be happier if you keep them near you and feed them whenever they\u2019re hungry. This will help your body to produce plenty of milk. Skin-to-skin contact is good at any time. It will help to comfort you and your baby over the first few days and weeks as you get to know each other. Skin-to-skin after a caesarean If your baby is born by caesarean section, you should still be able to have skin-to-skin contact with your baby straight after the birth. Some births involve complications that mean skin-to-skin may be delayed. If this happens, it doesn\u2019t mean that you won\u2019t be able to breastfeed your baby. Your midwife will help you have skin-to-skin contact with your baby as soon as it's possible. Colostrum: your first milk  Every pregnant woman makes milk for her baby, which is ready and available at birth. This milk is called colostrum and is sometimes a yellow colour. It's very concentrated, so your baby will only need a small amount at each feed (approximately a teaspoonful). Your baby may want to feed quite frequently, perhaps every hour. But they will begin to have longer feeds less often when your milk comes in, in a few days. The more you breastfeed the more milk you'll produce. The time between feeds will vary, and you and your baby will settle into a pattern, which may change from time to time. How often will my baby breastfeed? All babies are different, and it may depend on the type of birth you've had. Your baby should feed within the first hour after birth to get off to a good start. Babies then sometimes have a sleep and afterwards will start to give you signs that they're ready for the next feed. These signs may include: starting to move about as they wake up moving their head around finding something to suck, usually their fingers  Building up your milk supply Around two to four days after birth you may notice that your breasts become fuller and warmer. This is often referred to as your milk \"coming in\". Your milk will vary according to your baby\u2019s needs. It will look thin compared with colostrum, but gets creamier as the feed goes on. Each time your baby feeds, your body knows to make the next feed. The amount of milk you make will increase or decrease depending on how often your baby feeds. In the early days, \"topping up\" with infant formula can decrease your milk supply. Feed your baby as often as they want. This is called baby-led feeding (it's also known as \"on-demand\" or \"responsive\" feeding). Let your baby decide when they\u2019ve had enough. It's not necessary to time the feeds. In the beginning, it can seem that you're doing nothing but feeding, but gradually, you and your baby will get into a pattern of feeding (routine), and the amount of milk you produce will settle. It's important to breastfeed at night because this is when you produce more hormones (prolactin) to build up your milk supply. At night, your baby will be safest sleeping in a cot or Moses basket in the same room as you. See how to tell if your baby is getting enough milk. The let-down reflex Your baby\u2019s sucking causes milk stored in your breasts to be squeezed down ducts towards your nipples. This is called the let-down reflex. Some women get a tingling feeling, which can be quite strong. Others feel nothing at all. You'll see your baby respond, and their quick sucks will change to deep rhythmic swallows as the milk begins to flow. Babies often pause after the initial quick sucks while they wait for more milk to be delivered. If your baby seems to fall asleep before the deep swallowing stage, check they\u2019re effectively attached. Sometimes you'll notice your milk flowing in response to your baby crying or when you have a warm bath or shower. Leaking breast milk Sometimes, breast milk may leak unexpectedly from your nipples. Press your hand gently but firmly on your nipple when this happens. This usually helps very quickly. Wearing breast pads will stop your clothes becoming wet with breast milk. Expressing some milk may also help. Help and support for breastfeeding For more information on how to get comfortable and make sure your baby is properly attached, see Positioning and attachment. If you're very uncomfortable or sore, ask for help. Midwives, health visitors and trained volunteers can offer information and practical help with breastfeeding. Talk to your midwife or health visitor about the information and support available in your area. Or call the National Breastfeeding Helpline on 0300 100 0212.

But it's a good idea for you, just like everyone else, to eat a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes: at least five portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables a day, including fresh, frozen, tinned and dried fruit and vegetables, and no more than one 150ml glass of 100% unsweetened juice starchy foods, such as wholemeal bread, pasta, rice and potatoes plenty of fibre from wholemeal bread and pasta, breakfast cereals, rice, pulses such as beans and lentils, and fruit and vegetables \u2013 after birth, some women have bowel problems and constipation, and fibre helps with both of these protein, such as lean meat and chicken, fish, eggs, nuts, seeds, soya foods and pulses \u2013 at least two portions of fish a week is recommended, including some oily fish dairy foods, such as milk, cheese and yoghurt \u2013 these contain calcium and are a source of protein drinking plenty of fluids \u2013 have a drink beside you when you settle down to breastfeed: water and skimmed or semi-skimmed milk are all good choices See more detailed advice about healthy eating. Small amounts of what you're eating and drinking can pass to your baby through your breast milk. If you think a food you're eating is affecting your baby and they're unsettled, talk to your GP or health visitor, or contact the National Breastfeeding Helpline on 0300 100 0212. Vitamins and breastfeeding While breastfeeding, it's recommended you take supplements containing 10 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D each day. You can get all the other vitamins and minerals you need by eating a varied and balanced diet. Ask your GP or health visitor where to get vitamin D supplements. You may be able to get free vitamin supplements without a prescription if you're eligible for Healthy Start. Healthy snack ideas for breastfeeding mums The following snacks are quick and simple to make, and will give you energy and strength: fresh fruit sandwiches filled with salad, grated cheese, mashed salmon or cold meat  yoghurts and fromage frais hummus with bread or vegetable sticks ready-to-eat dried apricots, figs or prunes vegetable and bean soups fortified unsweetened breakfast cereals, muesli and other wholegrain cereals with milk milky drinks or a 150ml glass of 100% unsweetened fruit juice baked beans on toast or a baked potato Healthy Start vouchers You can get Healthy Start vouchers if you're pregnant or have a young child under four and are getting certain benefits or tax credits, or you're pregnant and under 18. These can be spent on milk and fresh or frozen fruit and vegetables, or they can be put towards formula milk if you're not breastfeeding. You can't use vouchers to buy fruit and veg with added fat, sugar and salt or flavourings, such as oven chips and seasoned stir fries. You can also get Healthy Start vouchers for free vitamin supplements.  For more information or an application leaflet, visit the Healthy Start website, or call the helpline on 0845 607 6823. If you're already receiving Healthy Start vouchers, ask your midwife or health visitor where you can exchange the vouchers for vitamins. Eating fish while breastfeeding Eating fish is good for your health and your baby's, but while you are breastfeeding you should have no more than two portions of oily fish a week. A portion is around 140g. Oily fish includes fresh mackerel, sardines, trout and tuna, but not canned tuna, as the good fats are lost in the canning process. All adults should also eat no more than one portion a week of shark, swordfish or marlin. See more about eating fish while pregnant or breastfeeding. Caffeine and breastfeeding Caffeine can reach your baby through your breast milk and may keep them awake. Caffeine occurs naturally in lots of foods and drinks, including coffee, tea and chocolate. It's also added to some soft drinks and energy drinks, as well as some cold and flu remedies. Caffeine is a stimulant and can make your baby restless. It's a good idea for pregnant and breastfeeding women to restrict their caffeine intake to less than 300mg a day: one mug of filter coffee: 140mg one mug of instant coffee: 100mg one mug of tea: 75mg one can of energy drink: up to 80mg one 50g plain chocolate bar: up to 50mg one cola drink (354mls): 40mg Try decaffeinated tea and coffee, herbal teas, 100% fruit juice (but no more than one 150ml glass per day) or mineral water. Avoid energy drinks, which can be very high in caffeine. Peanuts and breastfeeding If you'd like to eat peanuts or foods containing peanuts, such as peanut butter, while breastfeeding, you can do so as part of a healthy, balanced diet (unless, of course, you are allergic to them). There's no clear evidence that eating peanuts while breastfeeding affects your baby's chances of developing a peanut allergy. If you have any questions or concerns, you can talk to your GP, midwife or health visitor. See more about food allergies.

That way issues like sore nipples or breast engorgement can be sorted out early. Here are some of the problems breastfeeding mums sometimes have, plus tips on how to tackle them. Sore or cracked nipples Not enough breast milk Breast engorgement Baby is not latching on properly Too much breast milk Breastfeeding and thrush Blocked milk duct Mastitis Breast abscess Breastfeeding and tongue tie Sore or cracked nipples Sore nipples are most common about three to seven days into breastfeeding. It usually happens because your baby isn't well positioned and attached at the breast. Putting up with it could make pain or discomfort worse, so it's important to get help from your midwife, health visitor or breastfeeding specialist as soon as you can. See more advice on sore nipples. Not enough breast milk When you first start breastfeeding, you may worry that your baby isn't getting enough milk. It can take a little while before you feel confident that your baby is getting what they need. Learn the signs that your baby is getting enough milk. Offering your baby both breasts at each feed and alternating which breast you start with will help to stimulate your milk supply. So will keeping your baby close and holding them skin to skin. See more ways to boost your breast milk supply. Breast engorgement Breast engorgement is when your breasts get too full of milk. They may feel hard, tight and painful. Engorgement can happen in the early days when you and your baby are still getting used to breastfeeding. It can take a few days for your milk supply to match your baby's needs. Engorgement can also happen when your baby is older and not feeding so frequently, perhaps when they start having solid foods.  See how to manage breast engorgement. Baby is not latching on properly Breastfeeding is a skill that you and your baby need to learn together. It may take you both a while to get the hang of it. If you are finding breastfeeding painful or your baby doesn't seem to be satisfied after feeds, they may not be latching onto the breast properly. Find out how to latch your baby on. Learn the signs that your baby is well attached. Too much breast milk Occasionally women make too much breast milk and their babies struggle to cope. It's best to get your midwife, health visitor or breastfeeding specialist to watch a feed to see if they can spot why this is happening. They can also show you different positions to help your baby cope with large amounts of milk. Read more on how to tackle too much breast milk. Breastfeeding and thrush Thrush infections can sometimes happen when your nipples become cracked or damaged. This means the candida fungus that causes thrush can get into your nipple or breast. If you suspect you or your baby has a thrush infection, see your health visitor or GP. See how to spot the signs of thrush while breastfeeding. Blocked milk duct If breast engorgement continues, it can lead to a blocked milk duct. You may feel a small, tender lump in your breast. Frequent feeding from the affected breast may help. If possible, position your baby with their chin pointing towards the lump so they can feed from that part of the breast. See more help for blocked milk ducts. Mastitis Mastitis (inflammation of the breast) happens when a blocked milk duct isn't relieved. It makes the breast feel hot and painful, and can make you feel very unwell with flu-like symptoms. It's important to carry on breastfeeding. Starting feeds with the tender breast may help. See more self-help tips for mastitis. If you are no better within 12-24 hours, or if you feel worse, contact your GP or out-of-hours service as you may need antibiotics. Breast abscess If mastitis is not treated, or if it doesn't respond to treatment, it can lead to a breast abscess, which may need an operation to drain it. Read more about breast abscesses. Breastfeeding and tongue tie In about 4-11% of babies, the strip of skin that attaches the tongue to the floor of the mouth (frenulum) is shorter than usual. This is known as tongue tie. Some babies who have a tongue tie don't seem to be bothered by it. In others, it can stop the tongue moving freely, which can make it harder for them to breastfeed. The good news is that tongue tie easily treated. See the signs of tongue tie in breastfed babies.

The child seems to stop breathing on the outward breath (exhalation), turns a deathly pale grey or blue colour, and temporarily loses consciousness. The episodes are involuntary, which means the child can't control them. They usually last for less than a minute and, although upsetting to witness, don't harm the child. Breath-holding spells are common, with one type or the other occurring in around 1 in 20 children. They usually start between 6 and 18 months of age, and affect both boys and girls equally. In many cases they'll stop by the time the child is four or five years old, although some children will continue to experience them into adulthood. This topic covers:  Types of breath-holding spells Telling the difference between the two types What to do When to see your GP Treating breath-holding spells  Preventing breath-holding spells Types of breath-holding spells There are two distinct disorders that are called \"breath-holding spells\". Blue breath-holding spells Blue breath-holding spells are the most common type of breath-holding disorder, and often occur during vigorous crying or sobbing that's triggered by pain, frustration, anger or fear. The child usually cries vigorously for less than 15 seconds and then becomes silent, their breath held on the outward breath, unable to take an inward breath (inhale). They turn blue \u2013 particularly around the lips \u2013 and lose consciousness. Milder attacks without loss of consciousness will be familiar to most parents. The child will become either floppy or stiff and remain unconscious for less than a minute before regaining consciousness and breathing normally again. They may appear tired for a while afterwards. Blue breath-holding spells are caused by an involuntary reflex that's part of the crying mechanism. In some children, particularly in toddlers, it's so intense that they get stuck in an outward breath for so long that they faint. In the pre-school years some children may have several fainting episodes a week. However, most children will grow out of them by the time they start school. The episodes are involuntary, aren't dangerous and don't cause brain damage. They're not a sign of a difficult child or poor parenting. They're not epileptic seizures. The episodes will improve with age, but may get more frequent before they become less frequent and disappear altogether. If the child is iron deficient, treatment with iron supplements can help. A simple blood test can be used to determine whether the child is anaemic or iron deficient. Reflex anoxic seizures Reflex anoxic seizures are often triggered by a sudden unexpected fright or pain, such as a fall with a minor head injury. The seizure isn't caused by the injury itself, but by the sudden fright or pain. The child will often open their mouth as if they're going to cry, but make no sound before turning a deathly pale grey colour and losing consciousness. They'll become either limp or more often stiff, with their eyes rolling upwards and their fingers clawed. Their body may also jerk a few times. The seizure will usually last less than a minute. Afterwards the child will regain consciousness, but may appear sleepy and confused for a few hours. Reflex anoxic seizures are caused by an involuntary slowing of the heart rate, to the extent that the heart actually stops beating for 5-30 seconds. This is why the child looks so deathly pale. However, the heart is normal and the slowing is caused by an excessively strong reflex signal from the brain via the vagus nerve.  The vagus nerve is one of 12 nerves in the head. It runs down the inside of the head, passes through the neck, and into the chest and abdomen. After five seconds of the heart beat stopping, the child will start to lose consciousness, and after 10 seconds they'll be deeply unconscious. Usually, by 30 seconds the vagus nerve starts to lose its signal strength and the heart starts beating again on its own. The heart will always automatically start to beat on its own as the strength of the vagus nerve signal fades. In the pre-school years some children may have several reflex anoxic seizures a month, but most will grow out of them by the time they start school. Some children will continue to occasionally have them into adult life. Reflex anoxic seizures are involuntary, aren't dangerous and don't cause brain damage or death. They're not a sign of a difficult child or poor parenting. They're not epileptic seizures. The seizures will improve with age, but may get more frequent before becoming less frequent or disappearing altogether. If the child is iron deficient, treatment with iron supplements can help. A simple blood test can be used to determine whether the child is anaemic or iron deficient. Telling the difference between the two types It isn't always possible to tell the difference between a blue breath-holding spell and a reflex anoxic seizure. However, in most cases the advice will be the same \u2013 reassurance and treatment for iron deficiency. If episodes are very frequent or severe, it's worth trying to distinguish between them. The main features of a blue breath-holding spell are: they usually occur when the child is very upset and cries vigorously the child turns blue and stops breathing after a series of sobs where they breath out (exhale) breathing will resume after gasping or taking an inward breath the child may go stiff or floppy while unconscious The main features of reflex anoxic seizures are: they usually occur when the child has a sudden, unexpected fright or pain \u2013 the trigger may not always be obvious the child may or may not cry or sob first they typically go a deathly pale grey colour and collapse, losing consciousness they often go stiff rather than floppy, and then gasp as they come round when their colour returns What to do if your child has a breath-holding spell If your child has a blue breath-holding spell or reflex anoxic seizure, you should: stay calm \u2013 it should pass in less than a minute lie them on their side \u2013 don't pick them up keep an eye on them until the spell ends  make sure they can't hit their head, arms or legs on anything \u2013 if they start to jerk, gently cushion their head, arms or legs to prevent injury avoid shaking or hitting them avoid putting anything in their mouth \u2013 including your fingers avoid splashing them with water avoid mouth-to-mouth resuscitation  You don't need to try to help your child breathe or help their heart beat. They'll start breathing on their own, and their heart will return to a normal rhythm on its own after the episode or seizure has finished \u2013 this is usually in less than a minute. Afterwards, they may cry or scream. Reassure your child and make sure they get plenty of rest after having a blue breath-holding spell or reflex anoxic seizure. Act as if nothing has happened and avoid making a fuss \u2013 don't punish or reward them. When to see your GP See your GP the first time your child has a blue breath-holding spell or reflex anoxic seizure. Your child will need to be thoroughly examined to check whether they have a more serious underlying problem. Ask your GP to carry out a routine electrocardiogram (ECG) if they don't suggest one themselves. Your GP may ask you to describe what happens during an episode to see whether there's a trigger.  Blue breath-holding spells almost always occur during crying. Reflex anoxic seizures will sometimes have a trigger, such as a sudden unexpected pain or fright.  Epileptic seizures can look similar, but don't usually occur in these circumstances. You should also take your child to see your GP if they have episodes and: they're younger than six months they have frequent episodes (more than one a week) \u2013 it may be being caused by anaemia they're confused after a breath-holding episode any stiffness or shaking lasts much longer than a minute and they take a while to recover the episodes are so frequent and severe that they're affecting normal family life Although blue breath-holding spells and reflex anoxic seizures can be scary to witness, they don't harm the child and don't cause neurological problems, such as brain damage or epilepsy. Iron deficiency anaemia In some cases blue breath-holding spells and reflex anoxic seizures may be linked to iron deficiency anaemia. This is where a lack of iron in the body leads to a reduction in the number of red blood cells, causing symptoms such as tiredness, shortness of breath, heart palpitations and a pale complexion. Treating breath-holding spells There's no specific treatment for blue breath-holding spells, but your child should have a thorough examination to check for any underlying problems, and an ECG to check for an irregular heartbeat. Reflex anoxic seizures can respond to some specific medicines, but these are usually only offered in cases where the seizures occur very frequently and have a significant impact on family life. These medicines \u2013 which include glycopyrronium, atropine, and hyoscine \u2013 can cause a dry mouth, large pupils and other side effects. Ask your GP to refer your child to a specialist in childhood conditions (paediatrician) if you're concerned. Your child's blood iron levels, such as ferritin, may also need to be checked and iron drops or tablets prescribed if levels are low. Being a parent of a child with these seizures can be stressful, so see your GP if you're finding it difficult to cope. They may be able to give you some advice about things you can do to reduce stress, such as breathing exercises for stress. You could also seek help from a specialist counsellor who can teach you parenting techniques to help you deal with your child's breath-holding episodes.  Read more about counselling. Preventing breath-holding spells Some parents are able to tell when their child is about to have a blue breath-holding spell or reflex anoxic seizure because they display certain behaviours. Try to distract your child if you think they're about to have an episode as this can sometimes prevent it happening.

It's also one of the most common reasons people call 999 for an ambulance. It's normal to get out of breath when you've overexerted yourself, but when breathlessness comes on suddenly and unexpectedly, it's usually a warning sign of a medical condition. The information below outlines the most common reasons for: sudden shortness of breath long-term shortness of breath This guide shouldn't be used to self-diagnose your condition, but should give you an idea of what's causing your breathlessness. When to call a doctor You should call your GP immediately if you have sudden shortness of breath, as there may be a problem with your airways or heart. Your GP will assess you over the phone, and may either visit you at home or admit you to hospital. If your shortness of breath is the result of anxiety, you may be asked to come to the surgery rather than a home visit. If you've struggled with your breathing for a while, don't ignore it. See your GP as it's likely you have a long-term condition, such as obesity, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which needs to be managed properly. Your doctor may ask you some questions, such as: Did the breathlessness come on suddenly or gradually? Did anything trigger it, such as exercise? How bad is it? Does it only happen when you've been active, or when you're not doing anything? Is there any pain when you breathe? Do you have a cough? Do certain positions make it worse \u2013 for example, are you unable to lie down? Feeling like you can't get enough air can be terrifying, but doctors are well trained in managing this. You may be given extra oxygen to breathe if this is needed. Causes of sudden shortness of breath Sudden and unexpected breathlessness is most likely to be caused by one of the following health conditions. Click on the links below for more information about these conditions. A problem with your lungs or airways Sudden breathlessness could be an asthma attack. This means your airways have narrowed and you'll produce more phlegm (sticky mucus), which causes you to wheeze and cough. You'll feel breathless because it's difficult to move air in and out of your airways. Your GP may advise you to use a spacer device with your asthma inhaler. This delivers more medicine to your lungs, helping to relieve your breathlessness. Pneumonia (lung inflammation) may also cause shortness of breath and a cough. It's usually caused by an infection, so you'll need to take antibiotics. If you have COPD, it's likely your breathlessness is a sign this condition has suddenly got worse. A heart problem  It's possible to have a \"silent\" heart attack without experiencing all the obvious symptoms, such as chest pain and overwhelming anxiety. In this case, shortness of breath may be the only warning sign you're having a heart attack. If you or your GP think this is the case, they'll give you aspirin and admit you to hospital straight away. Heart failure can also cause breathing difficulties. This life-threatening condition means your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly. It leads to a build-up of water inside the lungs, which makes breathing more difficult. A combination of lifestyle changes and medicines or surgery will help the heart pump better and relieve your breathlessness. Breathlessness could also relate to a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate).

It's also one of the most common reasons people call 999 for an ambulance. It's normal to get out of breath when you've overexerted yourself, but when breathlessness comes on suddenly and unexpectedly, it's usually a warning sign of a medical condition. The information below outlines the most common reasons for: sudden shortness of breath long-term shortness of breath This guide shouldn't be used to self-diagnose your condition, but should give you an idea of what's causing your breathlessness. When to call a doctor You should call your GP immediately if you have sudden shortness of breath, as there may be a problem with your airways or heart. Your GP will assess you over the phone, and may either visit you at home or admit you to hospital. If your shortness of breath is the result of anxiety, you may be asked to come to the surgery rather than a home visit. If you've struggled with your breathing for a while, don't ignore it. See your GP as it's likely you have a long-term condition, such as obesity, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which needs to be managed properly. Your doctor may ask you some questions, such as: Did the breathlessness come on suddenly or gradually? Did anything trigger it, such as exercise? How bad is it? Does it only happen when you've been active, or when you're not doing anything? Is there any pain when you breathe? Do you have a cough? Do certain positions make it worse \u2013 for example, are you unable to lie down? Feeling like you can't get enough air can be terrifying, but doctors are well trained in managing this. You may be given extra oxygen to breathe if this is needed. Causes of sudden shortness of breath Sudden and unexpected breathlessness is most likely to be caused by one of the following health conditions. Click on the links below for more information about these conditions. A problem with your lungs or airways Sudden breathlessness could be an asthma attack. This means your airways have narrowed and you'll produce more phlegm (sticky mucus), which causes you to wheeze and cough. You'll feel breathless because it's difficult to move air in and out of your airways. Your GP may advise you to use a spacer device with your asthma inhaler. This delivers more medicine to your lungs, helping to relieve your breathlessness. Pneumonia (lung inflammation) may also cause shortness of breath and a cough. It's usually caused by an infection, so you'll need to take antibiotics. If you have COPD, it's likely your breathlessness is a sign this condition has suddenly got worse. A heart problem  It's possible to have a \"silent\" heart attack without experiencing all the obvious symptoms, such as chest pain and overwhelming anxiety. In this case, shortness of breath may be the only warning sign you're having a heart attack. If you or your GP think this is the case, they'll give you aspirin and admit you to hospital straight away. Heart failure can also cause breathing difficulties. This life-threatening condition means your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly. It leads to a build-up of water inside the lungs, which makes breathing more difficult. A combination of lifestyle changes and medicines or surgery will help the heart pump better and relieve your breathlessness. Breathlessness could also relate to a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate). Panic attack or anxiety A panic attack or anxiety can cause you to take rapid or deep breaths, known as hyperventilating. Concentrating on slow breathing or breathing through a paper bag should bring your breathing back to normal. More unusual causes These include: a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) pneumothorax \u2013 partial collapse of your lung caused by a small tear in the lung surface, which allows air to become trapped in the space around your lungs pulmonary embolism \u2013 a blockage in one of the blood vessels in the lung idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis \u2013 a rare and poorly understood lung condition that causes scarring of the lungs pleural effusion \u2013 a collection of fluid next to the lung diabetic ketoacidosis \u2013 a complication of diabetes where acids build up in your blood and urine Causes of long-term breathlessness Long-term breathlessness is usually caused by: obesity or being unfit poorly controlled asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \u2013 permanent damage to the lungs usually caused by years of smoking anaemia \u2013 a low level of oxygen in the blood caused by a lack of red blood cells or haemoglobin (the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen) heart failure \u2013 when your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate) More unusual causes of long-term breathlessness are: bronchiectasis \u2013 a lung condition where the airways are abnormally widened and you have a persistent phlegmy cough pulmonary embolism \u2013 a recurrent blockage in a blood vessel in the lung partial collapse of your lung caused by lung cancer pleural effusion \u2013 a collection of fluid next to the lung narrowing of the main heart valve, restricting blood flow to the rest of the body frequent panic attacks, which can cause you to hyperventilate (take rapid or deep breaths)  Page last reviewed: 29\/01\/2015 Next review due: 29\/01\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Outbreaks of typhus tend to occur in developing countries and areas where there is poverty, homelessness, close human contact and poor sanitation. The Rickettsia bacteria that cause typhus are carried by body lice, ticks, mites and fleas. This page covers the main types: epidemic typhus (the most serious form) \u2013 this type occurs in Africa, South America and Asia, and is transmitted by body lice  endemic typhus (the milder form of the disease) \u2013 it occurs throughout the world and is transmitted by ticks, mites and fleas  scrub typhus (also called Tsutsugamushi fever) \u2013 this type is caught from mites infected with Orientia tsutsugamushi bacteria, which live in heavy scrub vegetation in parts of rural southeast Asia, Oceania and northern Australia Typhus is generally not a problem in the UK. But you may become infected abroad if you catch Rickettsia-infected lice from infested people or bedding (in budget accommodation or on a sleeper train, for example), or if you are bitten by a Rickettsia-infected tick, mite or flea. How do you catch epidemic typhus? Epidemic typhus is passed from human to human by body lice. These are not the same as head lice or pubic lice, which are a nuisance, but don't transmit disease. The body lice become infected with Rickettsia prowazekii bacteria when they feed on the blood of an infected person. If you catch these infected body lice (for example, by using a louse-infested blanket), their infected faeces will be deposited on your skin as they feed on your blood. You only need to scratch a bite to rub the contaminated lice faeces into the tiny wound on your skin to become infected. Less commonly, you can catch epidemic typhus by breathing infected dried body louse faeces in airborne dust. How do you catch endemic typhus? Endemic typhus is transmitted by ticks, mites and fleas infected with Rickettsia bacteria. These animal carriers of typhus may live in thick scrub vegetation or on small mammals or rodents, such as rats. What are the symptoms? The symptoms of epidemic, endemic and scrub typhus are similar. Typically, someone with typhus will start to feel unwell 10 to 14 days after becoming infected. A sudden, severe headache is often the first symptom. Other symptoms may include: a fever \u2013 where body temperature rises above 38.9C\/102F for up to two weeks a pink or red rash that starts on the chest and spreads to the arms, hands, legs and feet \u2013 but not the face, palms and soles nausea and vomiting abdominal pain and diarrhoea joint and muscle pain \u2013 backache is common a cough In addition, the person with typhus is often mentally dazed or delirious \u2013 the word \"typhus\" comes from the Greek word meaning \"a cloud\". They may become deaf or have ringing in the ears (tinnitus). These symptoms usually last around two weeks. How is typhus diagnosed and treated? Anyone who is unwell shortly after visiting a high-risk country should see their GP, who will listen to your symptoms and take note of the countries you have recently visited. You will also be physically examined and have a number of tests \u2013 for example, a blood test to rule out other diseases such as malaria. If there is a rash, the GP may take a skin biopsy (a small sample of skin from the rash) and send this to a laboratory for testing. A diagnosis of typhus is confirmed if the Rickettsia bacteria are identified in a blood or skin sample. But the patient may be started on antibiotics even before the results come back if typhus is suspected. If treated promptly with either doxycycline or tetracycline, most patients improve dramatically within 48 hours of treatment and make a full recovery. If the patient has epidemic typhus (the more serious type), they may need to take antibiotics through a drip in their arm (intravenously) while they are in hospital. What are the possible complications? If typhus is not diagnosed and treated promptly, there is a risk of developing complications, including: long-term hearing loss or tinnitus low blood pressure organ damage and kidney failure secondary bacterial infection, such as pneumonia seizures confusion drowsiness gangrene The patient may need to have hospital follow-up for some months after recovering from an attack of typhus to receive treatment for these long-term problems. Brill-Zinsser disease Some people who previously had epidemic typhus will develop a milder form of the disease years later called Brill-Zinsser disease. This tends to happen when the bacteria were not properly killed off the first time and lie dormant (inactive) in the body. The bacteria then reactivate at a later date when the person's immune system is weak. Brill-Zinsser disease will need treating again with antibiotics. Can typhus be prevented? There's currently no licensed vaccine for typhus. The best way to avoid becoming infected with typhus is to avoid areas or crowds where louse-borne typhus is a problem, and take care to avoid contact with ticks, mites and fleas. Wash and change your clothes regularly, and don't use any bedding or clothing that could be infested with body lice. If you're about to travel abroad to an area where typhus is a problem, talk to your doctor about taking weekly doses of doxycycline to prevent infection. This is especially effective against scrub typhus.

The most common injuries in people with osteoporosis are: wrist fractures hip fractures fractures of the spinal bones (vertebrae) However, they can also occur in other bones, such as in the arm or pelvis. Sometimes a cough or sneeze can cause a rib fracture or the partial collapse of one of the bones of the spine. Osteoporosis isn't usually painful until a fracture occurs, but spinal fractures are a common cause of long-term (chronic) pain. Although a fracture is the first sign of osteoporosis, some older people develop the characteristic stooped (bent forward) posture. It happens when the bones in the spine have fractured, making it difficult to support the weight of the body. Who's affected? Osteoporosis affects over three million people in the UK. More than 500,000 people receive hospital treatment for fragility fractures (fractures that occur from standing height or less) every year as a result of osteoporosis. Causes of osteoporosis Losing bone is a normal part of the ageing process, but some people lose bone density much faster than normal. This can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures. Women also lose bone rapidly in the first few years after the menopause (when monthly periods stop and the ovaries stop producing an egg). Women are more at risk of osteoporosis than men, particularly if the menopause begins early (before the age of 45). Many other factors can also increase the risk of developing osteoporosis, including: long-term use of high-dose oral corticosteroids other medical conditions \u2013 such as inflammatory conditions, hormone-related conditions, or malabsorption problems a family history of osteoporosis \u2013 particularly history of a hip fracture in a parent long-term use of certain medications which can affect bone strength or hormone levels having a low body mass index (BMI) heavy drinking and smoking Read more about the causes of osteoporosis. Diagnosing osteoporosis Risk assessment tools If your doctor suspects you have osteoporosis, they can make an assessment using an online programme, such as FRAX or Q-Fracture. These tools help to predict a person's risk of fracture between the ages of 40 and 90. The algorithms used give a 10-year probability of hip fracture and a 10-year probability of a major fracture in the spine, hip, shoulder or forearm. DEXA scan They may also refer you for a DEXA (DXA) scan to measure your bone mineral density. It's a short, painless procedure that takes about five minutes, depending on the part of the body being scanned. Your bone mineral density can be compared to the bone mineral density of a healthy young adult and someone who's the same age and sex as you. The difference is calculated as a standard deviation (SD) and is called a T score. Standard deviation is a measure of variability based on an average or expected value. A T score of: above -1 SD is normal  between -1 and -2.5 SD is defined as decreased bone mineral density compared with peak bone mass below -2.5 is defined as osteoporosis Osteopenia You may be diagnosed with osteopenia if bone density tests show you have decreased bone density, but not enough to be classed as osteoporosis. Your doctor may still recommend some of the treatments described below, depending on your results and your risk of fracture. Treating osteoporosis Treatment for osteoporosis is based on treating and preventing fractures, and using medication to strengthen bones. The decision about whether you need treatment depends on your risk of fracture. This will be based on a number of factors such as your age, sex and the results of your DEXA scan. If you need treatment, your doctor can suggest the safest and most effective treatment plan for you. Read more about how osteoporosis is treated. Preventing osteoporosis If you're at risk of developing osteoporosis, you should take steps to help keep your bones healthy. This may include: taking regular exercise healthy eating \u2013 including foods rich in calcium and vitamin D taking a daily supplement containing 10 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D making lifestyle changes \u2013 such as giving up smoking and reducing your alcohol consumption Read more about preventing osteoporosis. Living with osteoporosis If you're diagnosed with osteoporosis, there are steps you can take to reduce your chances of a fall, such as removing hazards from your home and having regular sight tests and hearing tests. To help you recover from a fracture, you can try using: hot and cold treatments such as warm baths and cold packs transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) \u2013 where a small battery-operated device is used to stimulate the nerves and reduce pain relaxation techniques Speak to your GP or nurse if you're worried about living with a long-term condition. They may be able to answer any questions you have. You may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or other people with the condition. The National Osteoporosis Society can put you in touch with local support groups, and they also have an online discussion forum. Read more about living with osteoporosis. At-risk groups Osteoporosis often affects women, particularly after the menopause (when monthly periods stop). However, it can also sometimes affect men, younger women and children. Other groups who are at risk of developing osteoporosis include: people who have been taking steroid medication for more than three months women who have had their ovaries removed people with a family history of osteoporosis people with an eating disorder, such as anorexia or bulimia  people who don't exercise regularly people who smoke or drink heavily Page last reviewed: 20\/06\/2016 Next review due: 20\/06\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

How do I know if my ankle is broken? If you injure your ankle, the following can be signs of a fracture: pain and tenderness \u2013 particularly in the bones around the ankle being unable to walk or put any weight on the ankle swelling and significant bruising a 'crack' sound during the injury the ankle being a funny shape (dislocated) bone poking out of the skin (open or compound fracture) Because of the shock and pain of breaking your ankle, you may also feel faint, dizzy or sick. If the injury is not severe it can be difficult to tell if your ankle is broken or just sprained. An X-ray is needed to confirm whether the ankle is broken and help determine the most appropriate treatment. What you should do If you think you may have broken your ankle, go to your nearest accident & emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible. If it feels like only a minor fracture and it is not an emergency, it may be more appropriate to go to a minor injuries unit. Try to avoid putting any weight on the ankle. Ask a friend or relative to drive you to hospital and support your weight as you walk on your other foot. Raising the leg and applying an ice pack (try a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) can help reduce pain and swelling while you make your way to hospital. You can also take over-the-counter painkillers, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, to help relieve the pain. Call 999 for an ambulance if the ankle looks like it might be dislocated, or you can see bones poking through the skin. How a broken ankle is treated If your ankle is dislocated or the bones are badly misaligned (displaced) the doctor or paramedic may decide to manipulate them back into place (reduction). This is to avoid potential problems with the blood and nerve supply to the foot. A splint will then usually be applied to protect your ankle and keep the bones in the correct position while you are transferred to an accident and emergency department. You will be given strong painkillers or sedation to ensure your comfort during this procedure. At the hospital, your doctor will then decide whether you need surgery or if you just need a cast to support your ankle as it heals naturally. An X-ray is needed to confirm the fracture and to help decide on the appropriate treatment. Cast Most ankle fractures will need to be put in a plaster cast or splint for around six weeks. You'll usually be advised not to put any weight on the broken ankle for at least the first few weeks so you will need to use crutches to support yourself. This will depend on your fracture and in some cases you will be advised to walk on the ankle. Over the next few weeks, you'll normally be asked to attend follow-up appointments with an orthopaedic surgeon (a specialist in problems affecting the bones and joints) at a fracture clinic. Your doctor can advise you about things you can do to help your ankle heal and further X-rays may be carried out to make sure it's healing correctly. They may also replace your original plaster cast with a lighter one or a special removable boot as you recover. Surgery More severe fractures often require surgery to realign the bones and fix them in position. This is usually carried out under a general anaesthetic (where you are put to sleep). The surgeon makes cuts in the skin near the ankle and the bones are put back into position. A combination of plates, screws and wires may be used to hold the bones together, and the wound is closed using stitches. The metalwork is not normally removed later on unless it becomes a problem. Most people will stay in hospital for one or two days after surgery. A plaster cast will be placed over the ankle to protect it before you go home. Recovering It takes about six to 12 weeks for a broken ankle to heal, but it may take longer to regain full movement and return to all of your normal activities. Swelling can sometimes take a few years to improve. Ask friends or family to go shopping for you, as you won't be able to do this yourself. You will, however, be able to move around your home on crutches and manage stairs. How soon you can return to work depends on how badly you fractured your ankle and the type of work you do, but you will probably be off for at least four to six weeks. Follow your doctor or surgeon's advice on elevating, moving and resting the ankle, and make sure you attend all follow-up appointments after you have been discharged from hospital. If necessary, you may be referred to a physiotherapist who can show you exercises that may help speed up your recovery. Read more about caring for a plaster cast. When to see your GP Check the ankle regularly and see your GP if: the pain gets worse or is not relieved by ordinary painkillers \u2013 your GP may be able to prescribe a stronger painkiller you develop any other medical problems or want advice about returning to work you are planning on flying after ankle surgery \u2013 having recent surgery can increase your risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and your GP can advise you whether it's safe to fly When to go back to hospital Go back to your nearest A&E department if: you have pins and needles or numbness in your toes the skin around your ankle or foot has turned blue the ankle becomes very swollen you\u2019re having problems with your plaster cast there is a foul-smelling discharge from a surgical wound on your ankle These signs may indicate an infection or a problem with the nerves or blood supply to the ankle.

Doctors refer to all breaks or cracks in bones as fractures. Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if you think you or your child has broken a bone. If the injury is severe, dial 999 for an ambulance. If it feels like only a minor fracture and it is not an emergency, it may be more appropriate to go to a minor injuries unit. How can I tell if the arm or wrist is broken? A broken arm or wrist bone will be extremely painful and there may also be: swelling or tenderness around the injured area bleeding, if the bone has damaged the tissue and skin These symptoms may also occur if your arm or wrist is sprained rather than broken (read about sprains and strains). An X-ray in hospital is the only way to confirm whether or not the bone is broken. If it's a clean break, you may have heard a snap or a grinding noise during the accident. The bone can break straight across, diagonally, or in a spiral pattern. In severe cases, the bone may break into many pieces (comminuted), stick out at an angle or poke through the skin (open or compound fracture). What you can do It's important not to eat or drink anything if you think you've broken your arm because you may need a general anaesthetic so that the bone can be realigned. Before reaching hospital, a sling may help stabilise the arm (this goes under the arm and around the neck). Avoid trying to straighten the arm. Applying an ice pack, such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel, to the injured area can help reduce pain and swelling. If your child has injured their arm or wrist, try to get someone else to drive so you can support and comfort them. How a broken arm or wrist is treated A broken arm or wrist is usually treated in a hospital accident and emergency department. The treatment differs depending on the severity of the injury. A doctor will give you or your child painkillers and fix a splint to the arm to secure it in position and prevent further damage. An X-ray of the arm will then be taken to see what kind of fracture it is. Even hairline fractures show faintly on X-ray. A simple fracture, where the bone remains aligned, can be treated by applying a plaster cast. This holds the broken ends together so they can heal. You'll be given painkillers to take home and be told how to look after your cast. An appointment will be made to attend a fracture clinic so specialist orthopaedic doctors can take over the care of your fracture. With more severe arm or wrist fractures, the bones can become misaligned (displaced). If the bone isn't realigned (reduced), the bones won't heal well. Doctors use a technique called \"closed reduction\" to pull the bones back into position. Local or regional anaesthetic will be used to numb the arm (this is rarely used in children), or you'll be put to sleep using a general anaesthetic. If doctors are happy with the bones' new position, a plaster cast will be applied and you'll have regular follow-up appointments and X-rays. Certain fractures are best treated with surgery to realign and fix the broken bones. This includes displaced fractures, fractures involving a joint, and open fractures. Surgeons can fix bones with wires, plates, screws or rods. This is called open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Any metalwork isn't usually removed unless it becomes a problem. In rare cases, an external frame, known as an external fixator, is used to hold the broken bones in place. After most types of surgery, a plaster cast is applied to protect the repair. A sling may also be provided for comfort. You'll usually be able to go home within a day or two of having surgery. Recovering from a broken arm or wrist The plaster cast will need to stay on until the bone has healed. The length of time it will take to heal will depend on the type of fracture, whether it's damaged the surrounding tissues, and the person's age. For example, a young child who's cracked their wrist will need to wear a cast or removable splint for just two to three weeks. However, in older people, a wrist injury can take much longer to heal and stiffness is very common. A useful rule of thumb is that the time taken for the bone to regain full strength is usually the same as the time it takes for the fracture to heal. That is, if you\u2019ve been in plaster for six weeks, it will take six weeks to regain full strength. It's important not to get a plaster cast wet. Read more about how should I care for my plaster cast? for further information and advice. The orthopaedic doctors will decide when you can take the cast off and when you can return to work and normal activities. Your arm may be stiff and weak after being in a cast. Physiotherapy can help build strength in the arm muscles and restore full movement. However, it's rarely needed for children. The risk of re-breaking or cracking the bone after the plaster cast is removed is increased, particularly in children. Children should avoid using trampolines, bouncy castles, soft play areas and playing contact sports for a further two to three weeks to minimise this risk. Adults shouldn't drive while their arm is in a cast. Ask your doctor for advice about when you can drive again.

It usually happens after a fall or a blow to the shoulder. It takes about six to eight weeks to heal in adults, and three to six weeks in children. The collarbone, or clavicle, is a long slender bone that runs from the breastbone to each of the shoulders. You should be able to feel it running across the top of your chest, just below your neck. It is connected to the breastbone and shoulder blade via tough bands of tissue called ligaments. See your GP straight away if you've injured your collarbone. If your GP thinks it's fractured, they'll refer you to hospital for an X-ray to confirm the injury and have it treated with a sling and brace.  If you can't see your GP or if the injury is severe \u2013 for example, the bone is poking through the skin or the pain is unbearable \u2013 go straight to your nearest hospital accident and emergency (A&E) department. This page summarises the signs of a broken or cracked collarbone, and explains what you can do while you wait to see the doctor and how this injury is treated.  Signs of a broken collarbone A cracked or broken collarbone will be extremely painful. There may also be: swelling or tenderness around the injured area bruising to the skin bleeding if the bone has damaged the tissue and skin (this is rare) numbness or pins and needles if nerves in the arm are injured Your shoulder may be slumped downwards and forwards under the weight of the arm, as the broken collarbone is no longer providing support. You may have heard a snap or a grinding noise during the accident. In very severe cases, one end of the bone may poke through the skin. What you should do While you wait to see a doctor, stabilise the arm by using a towel as a sling (this goes under the forearm and then around the neck). Try to move the arm as little as possible. Take over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to reduce the pain \u2013 aspirin shouldn't be given to children aged under 16. Hold an ice pack to the injured area \u2013 try a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel. This can help reduce pain and swelling. Don't apply ice directly to the skin as it can burn. How a broken collarbone is treated Most broken collarbones are left to heal naturally using a simple triangular sling to support the arm and hold the bones together in their normal positions. The sling is usually applied in hospital after an X-ray has confirmed the collarbone is broken. You'll be given painkillers to relieve the pain.   Surgery under a general anaesthetic is only needed if the injury is severe \u2013 for example, the bone has broken through the skin \u2013 or if the bones have failed to line up and are overlapping significantly. Many different techniques have been used to repair the collarbone, but the most common is to fix the break with a plate and screws. If you need surgery to repair your broken collarbone, ask your surgeon to explain which technique they'll be using, and the advantages and disadvantages of this method. Being discharged You may need to stay in hospital overnight, depending on the extent of the injury. Before you're discharged, you may see a physiotherapist, who can show you some gentle arm and shoulder exercises to do at home with your arm out of its sling. These will help reduce stiffness, relieve some of the pain, and build up strength in your shoulder muscles. Follow-up You'll probably need to go back to the hospital outpatient department about one week later to make sure your collarbone is healing properly. See your GP if you have any concerns before this appointment. You should go back to the A&E department if you notice any weakness developing in your arm or hand, or if your pain suddenly becomes worse. How long does it take to heal? In adults, it usually takes about six to eight weeks for a broken collarbone to heal, although it can take longer. In children, it usually takes about three to six weeks to heal. However, it will take at least the same period again to restore full strength to your shoulder. While the fracture heals, a lump may develop along the collarbone. This is normal and often improves over the following months. Occasionally, the fracture doesn't heal (non-union) and you may need to have surgery. This should be discussed with your surgeon. Recovery advice You may find the following advice helpful while recovering from a broken collarbone: use extra pillows at night to keep yourself more upright if you find sleeping uncomfortable use ice packs and painkillers if pain and swelling continues while your arm is in a sling try to move your elbow, hand and fingers regularly as soon as it's comfortable to do so when you think the fracture has started to heal, try removing the sling for short periods at a time if it's not too painful avoid contact sports for at least 10 to 12 weeks after the injury \u2013 your doctor will tell you when you can go back to work and resume normal activities It's important to let your arm hang freely. Avoid resting your arms and elbows on chairs, tables, pillows or inside the sleeves of clothes until you've healed.

This page covers: Symptoms of a broken finger What to do if you've broken your finger Where to get medical help Treatments for a broken finger Aftercare for a broken finger Symptoms of a broken finger A broken finger may be: painful, swollen, and bruised stiff or difficult to move pointing in an unusual direction numb In some cases, the broken bone may poke through the skin (an open fracture) or you may see the bone through the wound. It can be hard to tell if a finger is broken, dislocated or badly sprained, as the symptoms tend to be similar. If you're not sure whether your finger is broken, it's a good idea to get medical advice. What to do if you've broken your finger You should get medical help if you think you've broken your finger \u2013 see below for information about where to go if you've broken your finger. While you're waiting for medical help: avoid moving the affected finger as much as possible \u2013 you could try gently securing it to the finger next to it, or to something like a pen or lollipop stick, using tape from a first aid kit as long as you're confident you know how to do it safely hold the affected hand above the level of your heart \u2013 this will help reduce any swelling gently hold ice wrapped in a cloth against the finger \u2013 this will also help reduce swelling and pain If it's an open fracture, cover the wound with a sterile dressing and secure it with a bandage. Apply pressure around the wound to control any bleeding. Where to get medical help If you think you've broken your finger, you should go to your nearest minor injuries unit, urgent care centre, or walk-in centre as soon as possible. Find your nearest minor injuries unit, urgent care centre or walk-in centre. You can also call NHS 111 for advice and information about the most appropriate local service to treat your injury. Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if there's no suitable alternative in your area, or you can see bone through the wound or sticking out of it (an open fracture). Treatments for a broken finger You'll be assessed by a trained practitioner, who will determine what tests and treatments are needed. An X-ray will usually be carried out to confirm whether your finger is broken, dislocated, or sprained. If it's fractured: the bone may need to be moved back into place \u2013 an injection of local anaesthetic is given to numb the area and a doctor then realigns the bone your finger will be put in a splint or plaster cast, or may be strapped to the finger next to it \u2013 this will hold the bone in position until it heals For open fractures, the wound will be cleaned surgically before the fracture is treated. You may also need a tetanus jab and antibiotics to help prevent infection. You'll be able to go home once the splint, cast, or strapping is in place. A follow-up appointment to check how your finger is healing may be arranged before you leave. Surgery may be required if the fracture is particularly severe and there has been damage to nearby nerves, tendons, or other tissue. The fracture may also need to be stabilised by fixing the bone with small wires or plates and screws. Aftercare for a broken finger A broken finger usually takes between two and eight weeks to heal, depending on which part of the finger is broken and how severe the break is. It may be a few months before full strength returns to the affected finger. While you're waiting for your follow-up appointment: try to avoid using the affected hand and disturbing the splint take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve any discomfort raise the affected hand above the level of your heart when you can to help reduce swelling \u2013 try resting it on a cushion while sitting and sleeping hold an ice pack, or something like a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a cloth, against the finger for about 10 minutes, three or four times a day \u2013 this can also help reduce any swelling The splint will be removed when the bone has healed. This will be after about two to three weeks for most people. Once the splint is taken off, keeping the finger moving as much as possible will help stop it becoming stiff. A physiotherapist may be able to advise you about some gentle hand exercises. Your doctor will be able to advise you about when you can return to contact sports or other activities that put a lot of strain on your fingers.

This affects the heart's ability to pump blood around the body. Some types of cardiomyopathy are inherited and are seen in children and younger people. This page explains the main types of cardiomyopathy: dilated cardiomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy takotsubo cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome' It then explains:  diagnosing cardiomyopathy treating cardiomyopathy information about you Dilated cardiomyopathy In dilated cardiomyopathy the muscle walls of the heart have become stretched and thin, so they can't contract (squeeze) properly to pump blood around the body. How serious is it? If you have dilated cardiomyopathy, you're at greater risk of heart failure, where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure. Heart failure typically causes shortness of breath, extreme tiredness and ankle swelling. Learn more about the symptoms of heart failure. There's also a risk of heart valve problems, an irregular heartbeat and blood clots. You'll need to have regular appointments with your GP so the disease can be monitored. Who's affected? Dilated cardiomyopathy can affect both children and adults.  The heart muscle can become stretched if you have an unhealthy lifestyle or an underlying medical condition, or both. The following can all play a role in the disease: uncontrolled high blood pressure an unhealthy lifestyle \u2013 such as a lack of vitamins and minerals in the diet, heavy drinking and recreational drug use a viral infection that causes inflammation of the heart muscle   a heart valve problem a disease of the body tissues or vessels \u2013 such as Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, lupus, polyarteritis nodosa, vasculitis or muscular dystrophy inheriting a mutated (changed) gene that makes you more vulnerable to the disease pregnancy \u2013 cardiomyopathy can sometimes develop as a complication of pregnancy But for many people, the cause is unknown. More information Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on living with dilated cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle cells have enlarged and the walls of the heart chambers thicken. The chambers are reduced in size so they can't hold much blood, and the walls can't relax properly and may stiffen. How serious is it? Most people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will be able to live a full, normal life. Some people don't even have symptoms and don't need treatment. But that doesn't mean the condition can't be serious. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden unexpected death in childhood and in young athletes. The main heart chambers can become stiff, leading to back pressure on the smaller collecting chambers. This can sometimes worsen the symptoms of heart failure and lead to abnormal heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation). Blood flow from the heart may become reduced or restricted (known as obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Also, the mitral heart valve can become leaky, causing blood to leak backwards. Read more about mitral regurgitation. These heart changes can cause dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath and temporary loss of consciousness. You'll also be at greater risk of developing endocarditis (a heart infection). If you have severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, you'll need to see your doctor regularly so your condition can be monitored. Your doctor will advise about the level and amount of exercise you can do and sensible lifestyle changes to make.  Who's affected? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is thought to affect 1 in 500 people in the UK. Most people inherit the disease from their parents. Read more about how genetic conditions are inherited.   More information Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on living with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy is rare and mostly affects older adults. The walls of the main heart chambers become stiffened and rigid and can't relax properly after contracting. This means the heart can't fill up properly with blood. It results in reduced blood flow from the heart and can lead to symptoms of heart failure, such as breathlessness, tiredness and ankle swelling, as well as heart rhythm problems. In many cases the cause is unknown, although sometimes it can be inherited. More information Read the American Heart Association's leaflet on restrictive cardiomyopathy (PDF, 102kb). Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy In arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), the proteins that normally hold the heart muscle cells together are abnormal. Muscle cells can die and the dead muscle tissue is replaced with fatty and fibrous tissue. The walls of the main heart chambers become thin and stretched, and can't pump blood around the body properly. People with ARVC typically have heart rhythm problems. Reduced blood flow from the heart can also lead to symptoms of heart failure. ARVC is an uncommon inherited condition caused by a mutation (change) in one or more genes. It can affect teenagers or young adults and has been the reason for some sudden unexplained deaths in young athletes. There's increasing evidence that prolonged, strenuous exercise worsens the symptoms of ARVC. It's important that people with or at risk of ARVC have a careful discussion about this with their cardiologist. More information Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on ARVC. Diagnosing cardiomyopathy Some cases of cardiomyopathy can be diagnosed after various heart scans and tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an echocardiogram. Cardiomyopathy that runs in the family can be diagnosed after a genetic test. If you've been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, you may be advised to have a genetic test to identify the mutation (faulty gene) that caused this. Your relatives can then be tested for the same mutation and, if they have it, their condition can be monitored and managed early. Treating cardiomyopathy  There's no cure for cardiomyopathy, but the treatments described below are usually effective at controlling symptoms and preventing complications. Not everyone with cardiomyopathy will need treatment. Some people only have a mild form of the disease that they can control after making a few lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes If the cause of your cardiomyopathy isn't genetic, it should generally help to: follow a healthy diet and take gentle exercise quit smoking (if you smoke) lose weight (if you're overweight) avoid or reduce your intake of alcohol  get plenty of sleep manage stress make sure any underlying condition, such as diabetes, is well controlled  Medication Medication may be needed to control blood pressure, correct an abnormal heart rhythm, remove excess fluid or prevent blood clots.  Read about: medication for high blood pressure beta-blockers to treat an irregular heartbeat or heart failure diuretics to remove excess fluid from your body if this has caused swelling anticoagulants such as warfarin to prevent blood clots medication to treat heart failure Hospital procedures In some people with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the septum (the wall dividing the left and right side of the heart) is thickened and bulges into the main heart chamber. They may need to have either: an injection of alcohol into their heart \u2013 this is to reduce part of the muscle in the septum a septal myectomy \u2013 heart surgery to remove part of the thickened septum (the mitral valve may be repaired at the same time, if necessary) Those with heart rhythm problems may need to have a pacemaker, or a similar device, implanted to control their abnormal heart rhythm. Read more about having a pacemaker fitted. As a last resort, a heart transplant may be necessary. Information about you If you have cardiomyopathy, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. GOV.UK has more information about the register. Broken heart syndrome Some people who sustain significant emotional or physical stress, such as bereavement or major surgery, go on to experience a temporary heart problem. The heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or \"stunned\", causing the left ventricle (one of the heart's main chambers) to change shape. It may be caused by a surge of hormones, particularly adrenaline, during this period of stress. The main symptoms are chest pain and breathlessness, similar to those of a heart attack \u2013 always call 999 if you or someone else experiences these. The condition \u2013 known medically as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or acute stress cardiomyopathy \u2013 is temporary and reversible. It's unusual for it to happen again.

Doctors sometimes refer to hip fractures as proximal femoral fractures. The hip joints The hip joints attach your thigh bones (femurs) to your pelvis. Hip joints are ball-and-socket joints. The ball is the rounded top part of the femur. The socket is the cup-shaped part of the pelvic bone that the rounded end of the femur sits inside. A hip fracture is a crack or break in the top end (neck) of the femur, nearest the hip joint. It can either occur in the part of the femur inside the socket of the hip joint (intracapsular), or outside the socket (extracapsular). Symptoms of a hip fracture  Symptoms of a hip fracture include: not being able to lift, move or rotate (turn) your leg being unable to stand or put weight on your leg, although in some cases this is possible a shorter leg, or your leg turning outwards more on the injured side If you think you've fractured your hip, you'll need to go to hospital as soon as possible. Dial 999 to request an ambulance. Try not to move while you're waiting for the ambulance and make sure you keep warm. What causes hip fractures?  Hip fractures are often the result of a fall. Falls are very common in older people due to other health problems, such are reduced vision and mobility and balance problems. A fall can cause a hip fracture if a person has osteoporosis (weak and fragile bones). Some people find it hard to recover after a hip fracture, up to one in three people die within 12 months of fracturing their hip (although most deaths aren't caused by the fall itself but by pre-existing illnesses). This is why the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends a co-ordinated programme of care for people who've fractured a hip (see below). Treating a hip fracture Surgery is usually the only treatment option for hip fractures. NICE recommends that someone with a hip fracture should have surgery on the day they're admitted to hospital or the day after being admitted. In about half of all cases, a partial or complete hip replacement is needed. The rest require surgery to fix the fracture with plates and screws or rods. The type of surgery you have will depend on a number of factors, including: type of fracture (where on the femur it is) your age your level of mobility before the fracture the condition of the bone and joint \u2013 for example, whether you have arthritis Read more about treating a hip fracture. Recovering from hip surgery The aim after surgery is to speed up recovery to help regain your mobility. The day after surgery, you should have a physiotherapy assessment and be given a rehabilitation programme that includes realistic goals for you to achieve during your recovery. The aim is to help you regain your mobility and independence so that you can return home as soon as possible. Read more about your care after discharge from hospital. How long you'll need to stay in hospital will depend on your condition and mobility. After having a hip replacement, it may be possible for you to be discharged in three to five days. Evidence suggests that prompt surgery and a tailored rehabilitation programme that starts as soon as possible after surgery can significantly improve a person's life, reduce the length of their hospital stay and help them recover their mobility faster. Read more about recovering from a hip fracture. It may also be useful to read your guide to care and support \u2013 written not only for people with care and support needs, but their carers and relatives too. It includes information and advice on: transport and getting around with mobility issues rehabilitation or 'reablement' services choosing mobility equipment, wheelchairs and scooters  Complications of hip surgery Complications that can occur after a hip operation include: infection \u2013 occurs in about 1-3% of cases blood clots \u2013 can form in the deep veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis); they can be prevented using compression stockings, exercise and medication pressure ulcers \u2013 can develop on an area of skin that's under constant pressure due to being in a chair or bed for long periods Your surgeon will be able to discuss these and any other risks with you. Read more about the complications of a hip fracture. Preventing hip fractures It may be possible to prevent hip fractures by taking steps to prevent falls and by treating osteoporosis. You can reduce your risk of falling by: using walking aids, such as a walking stick assessing your home for hazards \u2013 such as loose carpeting \u2013 and making it safer using exercises to improve your balance Read more about preventing falls and preventing hip fractures. Major public health issue Hip fractures are a major public health issue due to an ever increasing ageing population (80 is the average age of a person who has a hip fracture). Around 70,000-75,000 hip fractures occur in the UK each year. The annual cost for all hip fractures in the UK, including medical and social care, is about £2 billion. Hip fractures are more common in women due to the higher incidence of osteoporosis (weak and fragile bones) in women.

You usually won't be able to walk on it. If it's a severe fracture, the leg may be an odd shape and the bone may even be poking out of the skin. There may have been a \"crack\" sound when the leg was broken and the shock and pain of breaking your leg may cause you to feel faint, dizzy or sick. What to do If you think you or someone else has broken their leg, go immediately to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Call 999 for an ambulance if the injury seems severe or you're not able to get to A&E quickly. While you make your way to A&E or wait for an ambulance: avoid moving the injured leg as much as possible \u2013 keep it straight and put a cushion or clothing underneath to support it don't try to realign any bones that are out of place cover any open wounds with a sterile dressing, a clean cloth or a clean item of clothing \u2013 maintain direct pressure on the wound if it keeps bleeding If the person is pale, cold and sweaty (in shock), lie them down and carefully rest their legs above the level of their heart to improve their blood flow. When raising the broken leg, ensure it's kept straight and supported by a cushion. Keep them warm and calm until you can get medical help. How a broken leg is treated Immobilisation First, a doctor will give you painkillers and may fix a splint to your leg to secure it in position and prevent further damage. For severe pain, you may be given painkilling gas through a face mask or medication through a drip into a vein. An X-ray is often necessary to assess the fracture. If the broken bone is still in position, you'll usually just need a plaster cast. This holds the bone in place so it can heal. If there's a lot of swelling, you may just have a splint or cast around the back half of your leg until the swelling goes down. A full cast can be fitted a few days later. You may be provided with painkillers to take home and information on how to look after your cast. Read more about how to look after your plaster cast. Reduction If the bones are misaligned, a doctor or surgeon may need to put them back into place. This is known as \"reduction\". Sedatives are sometimes provided before the procedure and local or regional anaesthetic is used to numb the site of the break. In some cases a general anaesthetic is needed (which means you\u2019ll be asleep during the procedure). Once the bones are in the correct position, a plaster cast can be applied (see above). Surgery Severe fractures are often treated with surgery to realign and fix the broken bones. Surgeons can fix bones with metal wires, plates, screws or rods. Plates, screws and rods will usually be left in place permanently unless they become a problem, whereas wires will be removed 4-6 weeks after the operation. Sometimes an external frame (external fixator) is attached to the broken bones with metal pins to help keep them in place. This is removed once the fracture has healed. After surgery, a plaster cast may be applied to protect the leg (see above). Follow-up appointments An appointment will be made for you to attend a fracture clinic so specialist orthopaedic doctors can monitor your fracture. The first appointment is usually booked for a week or two after you're discharged from hospital. Severe fractures will usually heal within three to six months, but may require follow-up appointments every few months for a year or more afterwards. Further X-rays are often necessary to check how well your leg is healing. Recovering from a broken leg You'll be given advice by your doctor about how much you should move your leg and when you can put weight on it. It takes around six to eight weeks for a minor fracture to heal. You'll probably need to use crutches or a wheelchair during this time, until it's possible to put weight on the leg again. You'll be shown how to safely use any mobility equipment you're provided with. More severe fractures can take between three and six months to fully heal. Some can take even longer. The hospital may recommend regular physiotherapy appointments to help you maintain or regain muscle strength, movement and flexibility. This will include specific exercises to do before and after the cast is removed. Don't try to rush your recovery by returning to your normal activities too quickly, as the broken bone may not be fully healed even when the pain has gone. Follow the advice of your doctor, who'll probably recommend gradually increasing how much you use your leg over time. You shouldn't drive while in a cast. Seek advice from your doctor about when you can drive again. Possible complications For most people, a broken bone will heal within a few months and there won't be any further problems. However, complications can sometimes occur. These include: Damaged muscle, nerves or blood vessels around the fracture \u2013 this can occur during the initial injury or during surgery. It may lead to loss of movement or feeling, or may affect the blood supply to the limb. Bone infection \u2013 this is more likely if surgery is performed or the broken bone stuck out of the skin. It can significantly delay healing and will often require treatment with antibiotics and\/or surgery. Compartment syndrome \u2013 a painful and potentially serious condition caused by bleeding or swelling within a bundle of muscles. This can occur soon after a fracture, after the plaster cast has been applied or after surgery. Emergency surgery will usually be needed to relieve the build-up of pressure in your leg. Occasionally, a further operation may be needed if the bone doesn't heal properly. This can happen if the bone doesn't align properly during surgery, you put too much weight on the bone before it heals, the fracture is severe, if you have diabetes or you smoke during your recovery. Types of fracture Some broken bones are more serious than others \u2013 it depends on the location of the fracture, how the bone has broken and whether there is any damage to the surrounding tissue. The most common types of fracture are: Stress fractures \u2013 tiny cracks in the bone caused by overuse; common in athletes. Undisplaced or hairline fracture \u2013 a fracture through the bone with little damage to the surrounding tissue. Displaced fracture \u2013 the two parts of the broken bone have moved apart (misaligned). Comminuted fracture \u2013 the bone has broken (shattered) into several pieces. Open or compound fracture \u2013 a complicated break where the bone has broken through the skin, or the initial injury has exposed the broken bone.

Most broken noses heal naturally in two to three weeks and they can often be managed at home. The swelling should go down within a week, and the bruising should disappear after two weeks. This page describes the signs of a broken nose and gives advice on what to do. How do I know if I\u2019ve broken my nose? A broken nose will be painful, swollen and red. Other typical symptoms include: bruising around the eyes (black eyes) a nosebleed tenderness when you touch the nose a crunching or crackling sound when you touch the nose the nose looking deformed difficulty breathing out of the nose, as if something is blocking it Many broken noses can be cared for at home and medical treatment isn't always necessary, especially if the skin and septum (wall between the nostrils) are still intact. Caring for your nose at home You can often manage your broken nose at home by following the advice below: Hold an ice pack (frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel will also work) to the nose for 10-15 minutes every few hours for the first couple of days. If your nose is bleeding, pinch the soft part of your nose just above your nostrils for 10-15 minutes to stop the bleeding. Lean your head forward to prevent blood trickling down your throat. Take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve the pain. Prop your head up in bed by sleeping on a few pillows to help reduce the swelling. If your nose looks deformed, don't attempt to straighten it yourself. See your GP for advice. If your nose looks straight and your symptoms start to improve after a few days, you may not need to seek medical advice. In these cases, you should avoid wearing glasses until the swelling has gone down and you should try not to pick or blow your nose until it's healed. Avoid strenuous activities for at least two weeks and avoid contact sports for at least six weeks. When to see your GP Contact your GP if: the pain gets worse or is not relieved by ordinary painkillers (your GP may be able to prescribe a stronger painkiller) the swelling doesn't go down after a few days the swelling has gone down, but you still find it difficult to breathe through your nose your nose looks crooked you have nosebleeds that keep coming and going you have a high temperature (fever) It's important not to delay seeing your GP for too long if you have any concerns. If further treatment is necessary, this is most successful if carried out within a week or two of the injury. Find a GP near you. When to go to hospital Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if: you have a nosebleed that won't stop you have an open wound over your nose clear fluid is trickling from your nose (this could indicate a serious head injury) you have a severe headache you have neck pain or a stiff neck \u2013 especially if there is numbness or tingling in your arms you have problems with your vision, such as blurred or double vision you have other symptoms of a severe head injury you can feel or see a swelling (a blood clot) in your septum \u2013 this needs to be drained as soon as possible Find your nearest A&E department. Treatment for a severely broken nose If your nose is crooked or the skin is broken, you'll probably need to be assessed and treated in hospital. A doctor may be able to realign your nose using special instruments under general anaesthetic (where you\u2019re asleep) or sometimes a local anaesthetic (where the nose is numbed). You may need to return after a few days when the swelling has gone down before this can be carried out, but it should ideally be done within 14 days of the injury. If necessary, it may be possible to have a procedure to improve the appearance of your nose at a later stage, but this is generally more difficult and less successful than early treatment. Any broken skin will need to be closed with stitches or adhesive strips. If your nose is bleeding continuously, a doctor may pack your nose with a soft gauze pad to stop it. This will be removed by your doctor in a few days. Your doctor will let you know about any activities you need to avoid while you recover and whether you need to see a specialist for a follow-up appointment to check that the bones are healing in the correct position. Domestic abuse: getting help A broken nose usually results from a hard blow to the face, so it's sometimes a suspicious injury. If you're worried because you think someone may be a victim of abuse, offer your support and encourage them to talk. If you're a victim of abuse yourself, you can talk to your doctor or call the 24-hour National Domestic Violence Helpline on 0808 2000 247.

They can be very painful, but will normally improve within about three to six weeks. If you think you've injured your ribs, you'll often be able to look after yourself at home. Ribs can't be easily splinted or supported like other bones, so they're usually left to heal naturally. Broken and bruised ribs are generally treated in the same way, so it's not usually necessary to have an X-ray to determine what your exact injury is. You generally only need to seek medical advice if things get worse or don't improve, or if you were injured during a serious accident. See When to see a doctor, below, for more information. How can I tell if I've injured my ribs? A broken or bruised rib will feel very painful, particularly when you breathe in. You may feel you can only take shallow breaths, but it's important you try to breathe normally to help clear mucus from your lungs and prevent chest infections. You may also have some swelling or tenderness in your chest and bruising to the skin. Caring for your injury at home In most cases, you can take care of broken or bruised ribs at home. While your injury heals, pain relief is very important, as it will hurt every time you breathe in or cough. Taking shallow breaths and not coughing to avoid pain will only put you at risk of a chest infection. You can look after yourself by: regularly taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen (aspirin shouldn't be given to children aged under 16) \u2013 follow the dosage instructions on the packet holding an ice pack to your chest regularly during the first few days to reduce the pain and swelling \u2013 a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel will also work resting periodically \u2013 take time off work if you need to, especially if your work involves physical labour or the pain is severe keeping mobile between rest periods \u2013 walking around and moving your shoulders occasionally can help with your breathing and help clear any mucus from your lungs holding a pillow against your chest if you need to cough carrying out breathing exercises \u2013 take 10 slow, deep breaths every hour, letting your lungs inflate fully each time, to help keep your lungs clear Don't wrap a bandage tightly around your chest, as this will stop your lungs expanding properly. Try to avoid lying down or staying still for long periods. It may help to sleep more upright for the first few nights. Avoid straining and lifting heavy objects until you're feeling better, as you may injure yourself further and take longer to recover. If you smoke, stopping may also help your recovery. Get help to stop smoking. When to see a doctor See your GP if your pain hasn't started to improve within a few weeks. They can prescribe stronger painkillers if necessary and refer you to hospital if they feel you need further treatment. Seek medical help immediately if you develop any signs of a more serious problem, such as: increasing shortness of breath increasing chest pain pain in your tummy or shoulder coughing up blood  coughing up yellow or green mucus a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above The above symptoms may indicate a chest infection or may mean a broken rib has damaged your lung, causing the lung to collapse (pneumothorax) or injuring another organ, such as the liver or spleen. Go straight to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department for an assessment if your injury was the result of a serious accident, such as a vehicle collision.

It usually takes four to six weeks to heal, although severe injuries may take longer. A break or a crack in a bone is also known as a fracture. This advice is about the care of a toe following an injury. If you're not sure whether the toe is broken or just badly sprained, don't worry \u2013 in most cases, a painful and swollen toe caused by an injury should be cared for at home, regardless of whether or not it's broken. Learn more about sprains and strains. If you have a painful swollen toe but no injury, see your GP, especially if you have diabetes. How do I know if I\u2019ve broken my toe? A broken toe will be painful, swollen and red. There may be bruising of the skin around the area and sometimes a collection of blood beneath the toenail. You'll find it difficult to walk and wearing a shoe will be painful. If the break is severe, the toe may stick out at an angle. Most broken toes can be cared for at home and medical treatment may not be necessary. When to see your GP Check the toe every day and call your GP if: the pain gets worse or isn't relieved by ordinary painkillers \u2013 your GP may be able to prescribe a stronger painkiller the swelling or discolouration doesn\u2019t improve after a few days you have a wound near the injured toe, which will need cleansing to prevent infection When to go to hospital Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if: your toes are cold and numb or tingling (you may have damaged the nerves) the skin on your toe has turned blue or grey you've severely injured the toe \u2013 for example, if the toe is left bent at an angle or has an open wound Caring for your broken toe at home The following tips can be used to care for a broken toe at home. For little toes, put a piece of cotton wool or gauze between your injured toe and the one next to it and tape the two toes together with a plaster. The healthy toe will act as a splint. Using a shoe with a stiff sole or a surgical cast shoe will help your mobility. Keep your foot raised for as long as possible, for example by resting it on cushions. This will help reduce swelling and pain. Hold an ice pack (try frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) to the toe for 15-20 minutes every one to two hours for the first couple of days. Do not apply ice directly to the skin. Rest the toe by not walking or standing for too long, and not putting weight on the toe. Avoid any activities that might have caused the fracture until your toe is fully healed. You can begin normal activity once the swelling has gone down and you're able to comfortably wear a protective shoe. Take over-the-counter painkillers such as ibuprofen to relieve the pain, but don't give aspirin to a child under 16 years of age. Wear sturdy shoes that don't squash or bend the toe. Severe toe fractures If the break is severe and bone has broken away at an angle, this will need to be moved back into place using a technique called reduction. An X-ray of the toe will be required first. You will be given an injection of local anaesthetic to numb the area and doctors can often realign the bone through the skin without making any cuts. If a break is particularly severe, surgery may be needed so special pins or screws can be fixed to the broken bone to keep it in place while it heals. A broken big toe may need to be supported in a cast. If a lot of blood is trapped underneath the toenail and it's very painful, it will need to be drained through a small hole made in your nail, or the nail will need to be removed. You may be given crutches so you can walk without putting weight on the toe. A broken toe bone that has pierced the skin and damaged the surrounding tissue may become infected, so the wound will need to be cleansed regularly. You may be prescribed antibiotics and a tetanus jab may be considered if your vaccinations aren't up to date.

If an adult tooth is knocked out, try putting it back in place and go straight to a dentist. Don't try to re-insert a baby tooth \u2013 take your child to see a dentist immediately. If you can't put an adult tooth back into position, place it in milk and contact your usual dental practice. You may be able to see a dentist straight away or you may be directed to an urgent care dental service. If you don\u2019t have a regular dentist, contact NHS 111 for advice on where to get urgent care. If the tooth is just chipped, you should make an appointment to see a dentist to fill the tooth or smooth it down. This isn't an emergency and can wait until the dental surgery is open. Find your nearest dentist. A knocked-out tooth If you knock out a tooth, you should: find the tooth hold it by the crown (the white bit that sticks out of the gum) lick the tooth clean if it's dirty, or rinse it in water put it back into position (adult teeth only); never try to re-insert a baby tooth (see below) bite on a handkerchief to hold the tooth in place go to see a dentist as an emergency If you can't put the tooth back in position, put it in milk and see a dentist straight away. The sooner a knocked-out tooth is re-implanted, the more likely it is to embed itself back into the gum. If your child knocks out a baby tooth, you shouldn't try to re-implant it because you may damage the adult tooth growing underneath. Take your child to see a dentist immediately. At the dentist If you've put your tooth back in yourself, the dentist will check that it's in the correct position by having a look and taking an X-ray. They'll splint it to the teeth either side to hold it in position for two weeks. Splinting is a technique that temporarily attaches the tooth to keep it in place. If you've put your tooth in milk and gone straight to the dentist, the dentist will numb the affected area and reposition the tooth. They'll check that it\u2019s in the correct position by taking an X-ray before splinting it to the teeth either side for two weeks. A lost tooth If you can't find your tooth, the space can be filled with one of the following: denture \u2013 a removable false tooth that you have to take out to clean bridge \u2013 where a false tooth is glued to the teeth either side using a special cement  implant \u2013 where a titanium screw is placed in the jaw bone, and after a few months a mould is taken so that a false tooth can be made Some of the above treatments can be provided on the NHS. Read more about different types of dental treatments. A denture, bridge or implant will improve the appearance of your smile and restore your confidence. Not everyone needs to have missing teeth replaced \u2013 some people don't mind having a gap. Speak to your dentist about your options, to help you decide what you would like. A broken or chipped tooth If you have broken your tooth, try to find the fragment, store it in milk and see a dentist as soon as possible during working hours. The dentist may be able to glue the fragment back on to the tooth. Don't worry if you can\u2019t find the fragment, your dentist will be able to use a tooth-coloured filling material to build your tooth up. If part of a back tooth is broken, it may either need a filling or a crown (also known as a cap). If the tooth is badly broken and the nerves are exposed, it may be a little sensitive and may even need root canal treatment. This involves removing the nerve and placing a root filling. Protecting your teeth during sports If you play a sport, such as rugby or hockey, where there's a risk of being hit in the mouth, you may want to consider getting a mouthguard made by a dentist to protect your teeth. This involves taking a mould of your teeth, which will be used to make the mouthguard \u2013 this will fit well and protect your mouth. \"Boil and bite\" mouthguards, where the mouthguard is moulded using hot water, are also available, but they're not as good as one made by your dentist. This type of mouthguard is often uncomfortable to wear and doesn\u2019t provide the same level of protection as a custom-made mouthguard. The Dental Trauma UK website has more information about the management of dental trauma and mouthguards. Save a knocked out tooth Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

Doctors refer to all breaks or cracks in bones as fractures. Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if you think you or your child has broken a bone. If the injury is severe, dial 999 for an ambulance. If it feels like only a minor fracture and it is not an emergency, it may be more appropriate to go to a minor injuries unit. How can I tell if the arm or wrist is broken? A broken arm or wrist bone will be extremely painful and there may also be: swelling or tenderness around the injured area bleeding, if the bone has damaged the tissue and skin These symptoms may also occur if your arm or wrist is sprained rather than broken (read about sprains and strains). An X-ray in hospital is the only way to confirm whether or not the bone is broken. If it's a clean break, you may have heard a snap or a grinding noise during the accident. The bone can break straight across, diagonally, or in a spiral pattern. In severe cases, the bone may break into many pieces (comminuted), stick out at an angle or poke through the skin (open or compound fracture). What you can do It's important not to eat or drink anything if you think you've broken your arm because you may need a general anaesthetic so that the bone can be realigned. Before reaching hospital, a sling may help stabilise the arm (this goes under the arm and around the neck). Avoid trying to straighten the arm. Applying an ice pack, such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel, to the injured area can help reduce pain and swelling. If your child has injured their arm or wrist, try to get someone else to drive so you can support and comfort them. How a broken arm or wrist is treated A broken arm or wrist is usually treated in a hospital accident and emergency department. The treatment differs depending on the severity of the injury. A doctor will give you or your child painkillers and fix a splint to the arm to secure it in position and prevent further damage. An X-ray of the arm will then be taken to see what kind of fracture it is. Even hairline fractures show faintly on X-ray. A simple fracture, where the bone remains aligned, can be treated by applying a plaster cast. This holds the broken ends together so they can heal. You'll be given painkillers to take home and be told how to look after your cast. An appointment will be made to attend a fracture clinic so specialist orthopaedic doctors can take over the care of your fracture. With more severe arm or wrist fractures, the bones can become misaligned (displaced). If the bone isn't realigned (reduced), the bones won't heal well. Doctors use a technique called \"closed reduction\" to pull the bones back into position. Local or regional anaesthetic will be used to numb the arm (this is rarely used in children), or you'll be put to sleep using a general anaesthetic. If doctors are happy with the bones' new position, a plaster cast will be applied and you'll have regular follow-up appointments and X-rays. Certain fractures are best treated with surgery to realign and fix the broken bones. This includes displaced fractures, fractures involving a joint, and open fractures. Surgeons can fix bones with wires, plates, screws or rods. This is called open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Any metalwork isn't usually removed unless it becomes a problem. In rare cases, an external frame, known as an external fixator, is used to hold the broken bones in place. After most types of surgery, a plaster cast is applied to protect the repair. A sling may also be provided for comfort. You'll usually be able to go home within a day or two of having surgery. Recovering from a broken arm or wrist The plaster cast will need to stay on until the bone has healed. The length of time it will take to heal will depend on the type of fracture, whether it's damaged the surrounding tissues, and the person's age. For example, a young child who's cracked their wrist will need to wear a cast or removable splint for just two to three weeks. However, in older people, a wrist injury can take much longer to heal and stiffness is very common. A useful rule of thumb is that the time taken for the bone to regain full strength is usually the same as the time it takes for the fracture to heal. That is, if you\u2019ve been in plaster for six weeks, it will take six weeks to regain full strength. It's important not to get a plaster cast wet. Read more about how should I care for my plaster cast? for further information and advice. The orthopaedic doctors will decide when you can take the cast off and when you can return to work and normal activities. Your arm may be stiff and weak after being in a cast. Physiotherapy can help build strength in the arm muscles and restore full movement. However, it's rarely needed for children. The risk of re-breaking or cracking the bone after the plaster cast is removed is increased, particularly in children. Children should avoid using trampolines, bouncy castles, soft play areas and playing contact sports for a further two to three weeks to minimise this risk. Adults shouldn't drive while their arm is in a cast. Ask your doctor for advice about when you can drive again.

Anyone who has reached puberty can produce body odour, as this is when the apocrine sweat glands develop, which produce the sweat that bacteria can quickly break down. Men are more likely to have body odour, because they tend to sweat more than women. Things that can make body odour worse include: being overweight consuming rich or spicy food and drink \u2013 such as garlic, spices and alcohol some types of medication \u2013 such as antidepressants certain medical conditions \u2013 a fruity smell can sometimes be a sign of diabetes, while a bleach-like smell may indicate liver or kidney disease Excessive sweating Hyperhidrosis is a condition where a person sweats excessively and much more than the body needs to regulate temperature. If you have hyperhidrosis, you may also have smelly feet (bromodosis). Smelly feet are caused by wearing shoes and socks that prevent sweat evaporating or being absorbed, which attracts bacteria. When to see your GP See your GP if: your sweating or body odour is causing you distress you notice a change in your body odour you suddenly begin to sweat much more than usual Managing body odour Excessive sweating and body odour is an unpleasant problem that can affect a person's confidence and self-esteem. A body odour problem can usually be managed by getting rid of excess skin bacteria \u2013 which are responsible for the smell \u2013 and keeping the skin in the affected area (usually the armpits) clean and dry. The various treatments for body odour are outlined below. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons of treatments for body odour, which allows you to compare your treatment options. Self-care advice Your armpits contain a large number of apocrine glands, which are responsible for producing body odour. Keeping your armpits clean and free of bacteria will help keep odour under control. Following the below advice can help you achieve this: take a warm bath or shower every day \u2013 to kill the bacteria on your skin; on hot days, you may need to have a bath or shower twice a day wash your armpits thoroughly \u2013 using an antibacterial soap use a deodorant or an antiperspirant \u2013 after bathing or showering regularly shave your armpits \u2013 this allows sweat to evaporate quicker, giving bacteria less time to break it down wear natural fibres, such as wool, silk or cotton \u2013 they allow your skin to breathe, which means your sweat will evaporate quicker wear clean clothes \u2013 make sure you wash your clothes regularly  limit the amount of spicy foods you eat \u2013 such as curry or garlic, because they can make your sweat smell; evidence also suggests that eating a lot of red meat tends to make body odour worse Deodorant and antiperspirant The active ingredients used in antiperspirants and deodorants differ, so you may find some more effective than others. Deodorants work by using perfume to mask the smell of sweat. Antiperspirants contain aluminium chloride (see below), which reduces the amount of sweat produced by your body. Use roll-on antiperspirants if you sweat heavily, as they tend to be more effective. Aluminium chloride Aluminium chloride is the active ingredient in most antiperspirants. It helps prevent the production of sweat. If the above self-care advice doesn't improve your body odour, you may need a stronger antiperspirant that contains more aluminium chloride. Your GP or pharmacist can recommend a suitable product and advise about how often you should use it.  Aluminium chloride solutions are usually applied every night before bed, and washed off in the morning. This is because you stop sweating in your sleep, so the solution can seep into your sweat glands and block them. This reduces how much you sweat the next day. As the aluminium chloride solution begins to take effect, you can use it less often (every other night, or once or twice a week). Surgery Surgery may be recommended for severe body odour that can't be treated by self-care measures and over-the-counter products. One type of surgery involves removing a small area of skin from your armpit and the tissue just below it. This gets rid of the most troublesome sweat glands. It may also be possible for the sweat glands to be drawn out from the deeper skin layers using liposuction \u2013 a technique that's often used to remove unwanted body fat. Another option is a type of surgery called endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS), which uses keyhole surgery to destroy the nerves that control sweating. During ETS, the surgeon makes two or three small incisions under each arm. A tiny camera (endoscope) is inserted through one of the incisions so the surgeon can see the inside of your armpit on a monitor. The surgeon will insert small surgical tools through the other incisions, allowing them to cut the nerves. Alternatively, a thin electrode that emits an electrical current will be used to destroy the nerves. Risks associated with ETS include damage to nearby arteries or nerves, and compensatory sweating (increased sweating from other areas of the body). You should fully discuss the risks of the procedure with your surgeon beforehand.  Botulinum toxin Botulinum toxin, often referred to as Botox, is another possible treatment for people with excessive underarm sweating. Botulinum toxin is a powerful poison that can be used safely in minute doses. Between 12 and 20 injections of botulinum toxin are made in the affected area of the body, such as the armpits, hands, feet or face. The toxin works by blocking signals from your brain to the sweat glands, reducing the amount of sweat produced. The procedure takes 30-45 minutes, and the effects of botulinum toxin usually last for between two and eight months. After this time, further treatment will be needed. The availability of treatment with botulinum toxin on the NHS can vary widely, and it may not be available in your area.  You may need to visit a private cosmetic clinic for treatment. Prices can vary, depending on the area of the body being treated (treating both armpits can cost up to £500). Make sure you find out the cost before starting treatment.

Who gets smelly feet? Anyone can get smelly feet but they're more likely if you: are a teenager are pregnant are under mental or emotional stress stand up all day at work have a medical condition called hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)  are taking certain prescribed medications Medically known as bromodosis, stinky feet are a common year-round problem. The main cause is sweaty feet combined with wearing the same shoes every day. Why feet sweat Anyone can get sweaty feet, regardless of the temperature or time of year. But teenagers and pregnant women are especially prone because hormonal changes make them sweat more. You're also more likely to have foot perspiration if you're on your feet all day, if you're under a lot of stress or if you have a medical condition called hyperhidrosis, which makes you sweat more than usual. Fungal infections, such as athlete's foot, can also lead to bad foot odour. According to podiatrist, Lorraine Jones, feet become smelly if sweat soaks into shoes and they don't dry before you wear them again. Bacteria on the skin break down sweat as it comes from the pores. A cheesy odour is released as the sweat decomposes. \"Your feet sweat into your shoes all day so they get damp and bacteria start to grow. The bacteria continue to breed once you've taken your shoes off, especially if you put them in a dark cupboard. Then, when you put your shoes back on the next day, even if you've just had a shower, putting your feet into still damp shoes creates the perfect conditions for the bacteria to thrive \u2013 warm, dark and moist.\" How to treat smelly feet The good news is that there's a simple, quick, sure-fire solution to smelly feet. Wash your feet with an anti-bacterial soap called Hibiscrub. There are lots of over-the-counter foot hygiene products at your local chemist, but Hibiscrub is the best one. Leave on the Hibiscrub for a couple of minutes, then wash it off. According to Lorraine, \"if you do this twice a day, you'll definitely banish smelly feet within a week.\" She adds that you shouldn't use Hibiscrub on your feet if you have broken skin, such as eczema. Preventing smelly feet Keeping feet fresh and sweet smelling is all down to good personal hygiene and changing your shoes regularly. To keep feet fresh: Never wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row. Instead, wear different shoes on successive days so they have at least 24 hours to dry out. Make sure teenage boys have two pairs of trainers so that they don't have to wear the same pair for two or more consecutive days. Wash and dry your feet every day and change your socks (ideally wool or cotton, not nylon) at least once a day. Keep your toenails short and clean and remove any hard skin with a foot file. Hard skin can become soggy when damp, which provides an ideal home for bacteria If you're particularly susceptible to sweaty feet, it's a good idea to: dab between your toes with cotton wool dipped in surgical spirit after a shower or bath \u2013 surgical spirit helps dry out the skin between the toes really well \u2013 in addition to drying them with a towel use a spray deodorant or antiperspirant on your feet \u2013 a normal underarm deodorant or antiperspirant works just as well as a specialist foot product and will cost you less put medicated insoles, which have a deodorising effect, in your shoes try feet-fresh socks \u2013 some sports socks have ventilation panels to keep feet dry, and antibacterial socks are impregnated with chemicals to discourage the odour-producing bacteria that feed on sweat wear leather or canvas shoes, as they let your feet breathe, unlike plastic ones wear open-toed sandals in summer and go barefoot at home in the evenings When to see a doctor Smelly feet are a harmless problem that generally clears up. Sometimes, however, it can be a sign of a medical condition. See your GP if simple measures to reduce your foot odour don't help, or if you're worried that your level of sweating is abnormally high. Your doctor can offer you a strong prescription antiperspirant or refer you for a treatment called iontophoresis, which delivers a mild electric current through water to your feet to combat excessive sweating. Here are more tips on how to look after your feet. Top tip for prevention 'Never wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row.

The most common symptoms of bronchiectasis include: a persistent cough that usually brings up phlegm (sputum) breathlessness The severity of symptoms can vary widely. Some people have only a few symptoms that don't appear often, while others have wide-ranging daily symptoms. The symptoms tend to get worse if you develop an infection in your lungs. Read more about the symptoms of bronchiectasis. When to see your GP You should see your GP if you develop a persistent cough. While this may not be caused by bronchiectasis, it requires further investigation. If your GP suspects you may have bronchiectasis, they'll refer you to a specialist in treating lung conditions (a respiratory consultant) for further tests. Read more about diagnosing bronchiectasis. How the lungs are affected The lungs are full of tiny branching airways, known as bronchi. Oxygen travels through these airways, ends up in tiny sacs called alveoli, and from there is absorbed into the bloodstream. The inside walls of the bronchi are coated with sticky mucus, which protects against damage from particles moving down into the lungs. In bronchiectasis, one or more of the bronchi are abnormally widened. This means more mucus than usual gathers there, which makes the bronchi more vulnerable to infection. If an infection does develop, the bronchi may be damaged again, so even more mucus gathers in them, and the risk of infection increases further. Over time, this cycle can cause gradually worsening damage to the lungs. Why it happens Bronchiectasis can develop if the tissue and muscles that surround the bronchi are damaged or destroyed.  There are many reasons why this may happen. The three most common causes in the UK are: a lung infection during childhood, such as pneumonia or whooping cough, that damages the bronchi underlying problems with the immune system (the body\u2019s defence against infection) that make the bronchi more vulnerable to damage from an infection allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) \u2013 an allergy to a certain type of fungi that can cause the bronchi to become inflamed if spores from the fungi are inhaled However, in many cases of bronchiectasis, no obvious cause for the condition can be found (known as idiopathic bronchiectasis). Read more about the causes of bronchiectasis. Who is affected Bronchiectasis is thought to be uncommon. It's estimated that around 1 in every 1,000 adults in the UK have the condition. It can affect anyone at any age, but symptoms don't usually develop until middle age. Over 12,000 people were admitted to hospital in England during 2013-14 with bronchiectasis. The majority of these people were over 60 years old. How bronchiectasis is treated The damage caused to the lungs by bronchiectasis is permanent, but treatment can help relieve your symptoms and stop the damage getting worse. The main treatments include: exercises and special devices to help you clear mucus out of your lungs medication to help improve airflow within the lungs antibiotics to treat any lung infections that develop Surgery is usually only considered for bronchiectasis in rare cases where other treatments haven't been effective, the damage to your bronchi is confined to a small area and you're in good general health. Read more about the treatment of bronchiectasis. Possible complications Complications of bronchiectasis are rare, but they can be serious. One of the most serious complications is coughing up large amounts of blood, caused by one of the blood vessels in the lungs splitting. This problem can be life-threatening and may require emergency surgery to treat it. Read more about the complications of bronchiectasis. Outlook The outlook for people with bronchiectasis is highly variable and often depends on the underlying cause. Living with bronchiectasis can be stressful and frustrating, but most people with the condition have a normal life expectancy. For people with very severe symptoms, however, bronchiectasis can be fatal if the lungs stop working properly. Around 1,000 deaths reported in England and Wales each year are thought to be caused by bronchiectasis. Information about you If you have bronchiectasis, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Most cases are mild and clear up without the need for treatment within two to three weeks, although some children have severe symptoms and need hospital treatment. The early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to those of a common cold, such as a runny nose and cough. Further symptoms then usually develop over the next few days, including: a slight high temperature (fever) a dry and persistent cough difficulty feeding rapid or noisy breathing (wheezing) When to seek medical help Most cases of bronchiolitis aren't serious, but you should contact your GP if: you're worried about your child they are having some difficulty breathing they have taken less than half the amount they usually do during the last two or three feeds, or have had a dry nappy for 12 hours or more they have a persistent high temperature they seem very tired or irritable Your GP will usually be able to diagnose bronchiolitis based on your child's symptoms and by examining their breathing. Dial 999 for an ambulance if: your baby is having severe difficulty breathing and is pale or sweaty your baby's tongue or lips are blue (cyanosis) there are long pauses in your baby's breathing Read more about diagnosing bronchiolitis. What causes bronchiolitis? Bronchiolitis is caused by a virus known as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is spread through tiny droplets of liquid from the coughs or sneezes of someone who's infected. The infection causes the smallest airways in the lungs (the bronchioles) to become infected and inflamed. The inflammation reduces the amount of air entering the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. Read more about the causes of bronchiolitis. Who's affected? Around one in three children in the UK will develop bronchiolitis during their first year of life. It most commonly affects babies between three and six months of age. By the age of two, almost all infants will have been infected with RSV and up to half of these will have had bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis is most widespread during the winter (from November to March). It's possible to get bronchiolitis more than once during the same season. Treating bronchiolitis There's no medication to kill the virus that causes bronchiolitis, but the infection usually clears up within two weeks without the need for treatment. Most children can be cared for at home in the same way that you'd treat a cold. Make sure your child gets enough fluid to avoid dehydration. You can give infants paracetamol or ibuprofen to bring down their temperature if the fever is upsetting them.  About 2-3% of babies who develop bronchiolitis during the first year of life will need to be admitted to hospital because they develop more serious symptoms, such as breathing difficulties. This is more common in premature babies (born before week 37 of pregnancy) and those born with a heart or lung condition. Read more about treating bronchiolitis and the complications of bronchiolitis. Preventing bronchiolitis It's very difficult to prevent bronchiolitis, but there are steps you can take to reduce your child's risk of catching it and help prevent the virus spreading. You should: wash your hands and your child's hands frequently wash or wipe toys and surfaces regularly keep infected children at home until their symptoms have improved keep newborn babies away from people with colds or flu prevent your child being exposed to tobacco smoke Some children who are at high risk of developing severe bronchiolitis may have monthly antibody injections, which help to limit the severity of the infection.

The bronchi branch off on either side of your windpipe (trachea). They lead to smaller and smaller airways inside your lungs, known as bronchioles. The walls of the bronchi produce mucus to trap dust and other particles that could otherwise cause irritation. Most cases of bronchitis develop when an infection irritates and inflames the bronchi, causing them to produce more mucus than usual. Your body tries to shift this extra mucus through coughing. Bronchitis can be described as being either: acute bronchitis \u2013 temporary inflammation of the airways, causing a cough and mucus production, lasting up to three weeks; acute bronchitis can affect people of all ages but mostly affects children under the age of five; it's more common in winter and often develops following a common cold, sore throat or flu chronic bronchitis \u2013 a daily productive cough that lasts for three months of the year and for at least two years in a row; chronic bronchitis is one of a number of lung conditions, including emphysema, that are collectively known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); it mostly affects adults over 40 It's important that you stop smoking if you smoke and you have bronchitis. Cigarette smoke and the chemicals in cigarettes make bronchitis worse and increase your risk of developing chronic bronchitis and COPD. Your GP can help you give up smoking. You can also call the NHS Smokefree helpline for advice on 0300 123 1044 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm and Saturday and Sunday, 11am to 4pm). This page covers: Symptoms of bronchitis When to see your GP Causes of bronchitis Treating bronchitis Complications of bronchitis Symptoms of bronchitis The main symptom of acute bronchitis is a hacking cough, which may bring up clear, yellow-grey or greenish mucus (phlegm). Other symptoms are similar to those of the common cold or sinusitis, and may include: sore throat headache runny or blocked nose aches and pains tiredness If you have acute bronchitis, your cough may last for several weeks after other symptoms have gone. You may also find that the continual coughing makes your chest and stomach muscles sore. Some people may experience shortness of breath or wheezing, due to inflamed airways. However, this is more common with long-term (chronic) bronchitis. When to see your GP Most cases of acute bronchitis can be easily treated at home with rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and plenty of fluids. You only need to see your GP if your symptoms are severe or unusual \u2013 for example, if: your cough is severe or lasts longer than three weeks you have a constant fever of 38C (100.4F) or above, for more than three days \u2013 this may be a sign of flu or a more serious condition, such as pneumonia you cough up mucus streaked with blood you have an underlying heart or lung condition, such as asthma, heart failure or emphysema you're breathing rapidly (more than 30 breaths a minute) or develop chest pains you become drowsy or confused you've had repeated episodes of bronchitis Your GP may need to rule out other lung infections, such as pneumonia, which has symptoms similar to those of bronchitis. If your GP thinks you may have pneumonia, you'll probably need a chest X-ray, and a sample of mucus may be taken for testing. If your GP thinks you might have an underlying condition, they may also suggest that you have a lung function test. You'll be asked to take a deep breath and blow into a device called a spirometer, which measures the volume of air in your lungs. Decreased lung capacity can indicate an underlying health problem. Causes of bronchitis Bronchitis can be caused by either a virus or bacteria, although viral bronchitis is much more common. In most cases, bronchitis is caused by the same viruses that cause the common cold or flu. The virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when someone coughs or sneezes. These droplets typically spread about 1m (3ft). They hang suspended in the air for a while, then land on surfaces where the virus can survive for up to 24 hours. Anyone who touches these surfaces can spread the virus further by touching something else. Read more about how cold and flu germs spread. Breathing in irritant substances Bronchitis can also be triggered by breathing in irritant substances, such as smog, chemicals in household products or tobacco smoke. Smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis, and it can affect people who inhale second-hand smoke, as well as those who smoke themselves. People with chronic bronchitis often develop another smoking-related lung disease called emphysema \u2013 where the air sacs inside the lungs become damaged, causing shortness of breath. If you smoke, you should stop immediately because is aggravates bronchitis and increases your risk of developing emphysema. Stopping smoking while you have bronchitis can also be the perfect opportunity to quit altogether. Read more about stop smoking treatments. Occupational exposure You may also be at risk of developing chronic bronchitis and other types of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) if you're often exposed to materials that can damage your lungs, such as: grain dust textiles (fabric fibres) ammonia strong acids chlorine This is sometimes known as \"occupational bronchitis\", and it usually eases once you're no longer exposed to the irritant substance. Read more about the causes of COPD. You can also read the Health and Safety Executive's 2014 report on Work-related COPD in Great Britain (PDF, 58kb). Treating bronchitis In most cases, acute bronchitis will clear up by itself within a few weeks without the need for treatment. In the meantime, you should drink lots of fluid and get plenty of rest (see below). In some cases, the symptoms of bronchitis can last much longer. If symptoms last for at least three months, it's known as \"chronic bronchitis\". There's no cure for chronic bronchitis, but some lifestyle changes can help ease your symptoms, such as: eating a healthy diet can help prevent lung infections regular moderate exercise plus a healthy diet will help you to maintain a healthy weight \u2013 being overweight makes breathing harder avoiding smoking and smoky environments There are several medications to relieve symptoms. Bronchodilators and steroids \"open up\" the airways and can be prescribed as an inhaler or as tablets. Mucolytic medicines thin the mucus in the lungs making it easier to cough up. Managing symptoms at home If you have acute bronchitis: get plenty of rest drink lots of fluid \u2013 this helps prevent dehydration and thins the mucus in your lungs, making it easier to cough up treat headaches, fever, and aches and pains with paracetamol or ibuprofen \u2013 although ibuprofen isn't recommended if you have asthma There's little evidence that cough medicines work \u2013 read more about treating coughs. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has recommended that over-the-counter cough medicines shouldn't be given to children under the age of six. Children aged 6 to 12 should only use them on the advice of a doctor or pharmacist. As an alternative to an over-the-counter cough medicine, try making your own mixture of honey and lemon, which can help soothe a sore throat and ease your cough. Antibiotics Antibiotics aren't routinely prescribed for bronchitis because it's normally caused by a virus. Antibiotics have no effect on viruses, and prescribing them when they're unnecessary can, over time, make bacteria more resistant to antibiotic treatment. Read more about antibiotic resistance. Your GP will only prescribe antibiotics if you have an increased risk of developing complications, such as pneumonia. Antibiotics may also be recommended for: premature babies elderly people over the age of 80 people with a history of heart, lung, kidney or liver disease people with a weakened immune system, which could be the result of an underlying condition or a side effect of a treatment such as steroid medication people with cystic fibrosis If you're prescribed antibiotics for bronchitis, it's likely to be a five-day course of amoxicillin or doxycycline. Side effects of these drugs are uncommon, but include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Complications of bronchitis Pneumonia is the most common complication of bronchitis. It occurs when the infection spreads further into the lungs, causing the tiny air sacs inside the lungs to fill up with fluid. About 1 in 20 cases of bronchitis lead to pneumonia. People at an increased risk of developing pneumonia include: elderly people people who smoke people with other health conditions, such as heart, liver or kidney disease people with a weakened immune system Mild pneumonia can usually be treated with antibiotics at home. More severe cases may require admission to hospital. Page last reviewed: 03\/08\/2016 Next review due: 03\/08\/2019 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

They're often used to treat long-term conditions where the airways may become narrow and inflamed, such as: asthma \u2013 a common lung condition caused by inflammation of the airways chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \u2013 a lung disease usually caused by smoking which causes blockage of the airways, although this can be partially reversed with treatment  Bronchodilators may be either: short-acting \u2013 used as short-term relief from sudden, unexpected attacks of breathlessness long-acting \u2013 used regularly, to help control breathlessness in asthma and COPD and increase the effectiveness of corticosteroids in asthma (see below) Bronchodilators and corticosteroids Inhaled corticosteroids are the main treatment to reduce inflammation and prevent flare-ups in asthma. But some people may also benefit from taking bronchodilators to keep the airways open and to enhance the effects of corticosteroids. Long-acting bronchodilators should never be taken without corticosteroids. In COPD, initial treatment is with short- or long-acting bronchodilators, with corticosteroids added in some severe cases. Treatment with corticosteroids and bronchodilators may require the use of separate inhalers, but increasingly these medications are provided together in single inhalers. Types of bronchodilator The three most widely used bronchodilators are: beta-2 agonists \u2013 such as salbutamol, salmeterol, formoterol and vilanterol anticholinergics \u2013 such as ipratropium, tiotropium, aclidinium and glycopyrronium theophylline Beta-2 agonists and anticholinergics are available in both short-acting and long-acting forms, whereas theophylline is only available in a long-acting form. Beta-2 agonists Beta-2 agonists are used for both asthma and COPD, although some types are only available for COPD. They're usually inhaled using a small, hand-held inhaler but may also be available as tablets or syrup. For sudden, severe symptoms they can also be injected or nebulised. A nebuliser is a compressor used to turn liquid medication into a fine mist, allowing a large dose of the medicine to be inhaled through a mouthpiece or face mask. Beta-2 agonists work by stimulating receptors called beta-2 receptors in the muscles that line the airways, which causes them to relax and allows the airways to dilate (widen). They should be used with caution in people with: an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) \u2013 a condition that occurs when there's too much thyroid hormone in the body cardiovascular disease \u2013 any disease of the heart or blood vessels an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)  high blood pressure (hypertension) diabetes \u2013 a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high In rare cases, beta-2 agonists can make some of the symptoms and possible complications of these conditions worse. Anticholinergics Anticholinergics (also known as antimuscarinics) are mainly used for COPD but a few are also licenced for asthma. They're usually taken using an inhaler but may be nebulised to treat sudden and severe symptoms. Anticholinergics cause the airways to dilate by blocking the cholinergic nerves. These nerves release chemicals that can cause the muscles lining the airways to tighten. They should be used with caution in people with: benign prostatic hyperplasia \u2013 a non-cancerous swelling of the prostate a bladder outflow obstruction \u2013 any condition that affects the flow of urine out of the bladder, such as bladder stones or prostate cancer glaucoma \u2013 a build-up of pressure in the eye In people with benign prostatic hyperplasia or a bladder outflow obstruction, anticholinergics can cause urination problems. Glaucoma can get worse if anticholinergic medication unintentionally gets into the eyes. Theophylline Theophylline is usually taken in tablet or capsule form, but a different version called aminophylline can be given directly into a vein (intravenously) if your symptoms are severe. It's unclear exactly how theophylline works, but it seems to reduce any inflammation (swelling) in the airways, in addition to relaxing the muscles lining them. The effect of theophylline is weaker than other bronchodilators and corticosteroids. It's also more likely to cause side effects, so is often only used alongside these medicines if they're not effective enough. Theophylline should be used with caution in people with: an overactive thyroid cardiovascular disease liver problems \u2013 such as liver disease high blood pressure stomach ulcers \u2013 open sores that develop on the stomach lining epilepsy \u2013 a condition that affects the brain and causes repeated seizures (fits) Theophylline may cause these conditions to get worse. In people with liver problems, it can sometimes lead to a dangerous build-up of medication in the body. Other medicines can also cause abnormal build-up of theophylline in the body and this should always be checked by your doctor. Elderly people may also need additional monitoring while taking theophylline. Side effects The side effects of bronchodilators can vary, depending on the specific medication you're taking. Make sure you read the leaflet that comes with your medication to see what the specific side effects are. General side effects of bronchodilators include: trembling, particularly in the hands headaches a dry mouth suddenly noticeable heartbeats (palpitations) muscle cramps a cough nausea and vomiting diarrhoea Read more about the side effects of bronchodilators. Pregnancy and breastfeeding In most cases, bronchodilators should be taken as normal while pregnant or breastfeeding. However, speak to your GP if you regularly use bronchodilators and are considering having a baby or think you might be pregnant. Pregnancy may affect your asthma, so it's important to continue taking your medication and have it monitored regularly, to ensure the condition is controlled.

However, brucellosis is still a problem globally \u2013 it's the most common bacterial infection spread from animals to humans worldwide. It's a particular problem in parts of: The Middle East Asia South and Central America Africa Eastern Europe countries by the Mediterranean Sea \u2013 such as Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Southern France An average of 10 cases of brucellosis are diagnosed each year in England and Wales, and these are almost always in people who have acquired it abroad. How the infection is spread Humans usually become infected with brucellosis in one of the following ways: by consuming unpasteurised milk or milk products (such as soft cheeses) from infected animals, or very rarely, by eating raw meat from these animals by inhaling it in dust on farms with infected animals or in abattoirs through contact with cultures in medical or veterinary laboratories through direct contact with infected animals or surfaces \u2013 for example, a farmworker may become infected if the bacteria get into broken skin or their eyes Person-to-person spread is very rare, although there have been cases of transmission from mother to baby through breastfeeding, and through sexual contact. People at highest risk of brucellosis are laboratory workers, veterinarians, farmers and abattoir workers. Signs and symptoms Brucellosis doesn't always cause symptoms, and the infection may persist for several months without you knowing. In some people, symptoms will develop suddenly. In others, symptoms may develop gradually and be persistent or return again and again, lasting for years. Typical symptoms include: a high temperature (fever) loss of appetite and weight loss sweating headaches fatigue (extreme tiredness) back and joint pain  These symptoms tend to last a long time and can make you feel very ill, but most people will eventually make a full recovery after treatment.  Brucellosis is rarely fatal in humans, although some cases can lead to life-threatening complications such as endocarditis (infection of the heart) and meningitis (infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord) \u2013 particularly if left untreated. Diagnosis and treatment Brucellosis is usually diagnosed by taking a blood sample and sending this to a laboratory. The blood sample is tested for the antibodies against the brucellosis bacteria. The infection is treated with a combination of two or more different antibiotics, such as doxycycline with gentamicin or doxycycline with rifampicin. These will usually need to be taken for at least six weeks. Preventing brucellosis There is no human vaccine to protect you against brucellosis, so it's important to take precautions to prevent infection if you're at risk. If you're travelling to an area where brucellosis is a problem, don't consume unpasteurised milk or milk products, and only eat meat that has been thoroughly cooked. Cheese and other milk products imported illegally from countries where brucellosis is common may not have been pasteurised. Cases have occurred in the UK as a result of eating such products. If you work closely with animals that could be infected, make sure you wear adequate protective clothing. This might include gloves, an apron, goggles, and a mask that covers your nose and mouth. Make sure that any wounds you have are cleaned and covered with a suitable dressing or bandage before dealing with animals, and make sure to clean your skin thoroughly afterwards with water, soap and a disinfectant.

It can result in abnormally rapid heart rhythms, called arrhythmias, which can cause palpitations or fainting and can be fatal. However, some people with the condition have no symptoms at all. Even though the heart pumps and looks normal, it's possible for sudden electrical activity to lead to a dangerous heart rhythm. This problem can be genetic, or may be passed on in families (see What's the cause? below). Not everyone with Brugada syndrome experiences arrhythmia, but when it does happen, it can be fatal. This page covers: What are the signs and symptoms of Brugada syndrome?  How can it be fatal?  Who is affected?  What is the underlying cause of Brugada syndrome?  How is it diagnosed?  How is it treated?  What are the signs and symptoms of Brugada syndrome?  Often, there are no warning signs of Brugada syndrome until an abnormal heart rhythm causes the heart to stop beating (cardiac arrest). Some people may experience symptoms such as: blackouts seizures (sometimes) heart palpitations A family history of Brugada syndrome, or unexplained sudden deaths, may also be a warning sign. Around a fifth of people with Brugada syndrome also experience atrial fibrillation \u2013 a heart condition that causes an irregular and abnormally fast heart rate. Having a fever (high temperature) is thought to increase the risk of symptoms appearing, or aggravate existing symptoms. How can it be fatal?  Sometimes, the abnormal heart rhythm persists, leading to ventricular fibrillation (a rapid, uncoordinated series of heart contractions). Most of the time, this doesn't revert to normal heart rhythm without being corrected electrically, and usually causes the heart to stop pumping.  Brugada syndrome is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young, otherwise healthy people, and may not be diagnosed because there's no visible abnormality. It may explain some cases of sudden infant death syndrome, which is a major cause of death in babies younger than one. Sadly, most deaths from Brugada syndrome happen without any warning sign of the disorder. Who's affected?  Brugada syndrome typically affects young and middle-aged males who are otherwise healthy, although women can also be affected. It's also more common in young men of Japanese and South East Asian descent. Read more about South Asian health. Men are more likely than women to show signs of it, possibly because of the sex hormone testosterone, which is thought to play a role. What is the underlying cause of Brugada syndrome?  The heart of someone with Brugada syndrome is structurally normal, but there are problems with electrical activity. To properly understand the underlying cause, it's important to know how the heart cells work. On the surface of each heart muscle cell are tiny pores, or ion channels. These open and close to let electrically charged sodium, calcium and potassium atoms (ions) flow into and out of the cells. This passage of ions generates the heart's electrical activity. An electrical signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom, causing the heart to contract and pump blood. More information on how the heart works can be found at the bottom of this page. Genetic mutation There are many different genetic mutations that have been linked to Brugada syndrome. The SCN5A gene is most often involved, but only in around a third of cases. This particular gene provides instructions for making a sodium channel that transports positively charged sodium ions into heart muscle cells. The mutation in this gene affects the proteins that make up the sodium channels, so they don't work as well. There's a reduced flow of sodium ions into the heart cells, which alters the way the heart beats. Only one copy of the altered gene in each cell is needed to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has just one parent with the condition. Not all people with Brugada syndrome have these common gene mutations and there isn't always a family history of it. Other genes may be involved and there can be many factors contributing to the development of symptoms, including medicines and imbalances of salts in the body. How is it diagnosed?  If your GP thinks you have Brugada syndrome after assessing your symptoms, they may ask you to have an electrocardiogram (ECG) and refer you to a heart specialist (cardiologist). This should usually be a cardiologist who specialises in heart rhythm and genetic heart problems. ECG An ECG is a test that records the rhythm and electrical activity of your heart. Every time your heart beats, it produces tiny electrical signals, which an ECG machine traces onto paper. Small stickers, called electrodes, are stuck onto your arms, legs and chest and connected by wires to the ECG machine. If Brugada syndrome is suspected, you'll probably have a simple and safe test known as an ajmaline or flecainide challenge, to confirm your diagnosis. Ajmaline and flecainide are antiarrhythmic medicines (that correct abnormal heart rhythms), which block sodium channels. The medicine is given through a vein in your arm, and an ECG records how your heart responds to it. If given to someone with Brugada syndrome, it can reveal the abnormal ECG pattern characteristic of the syndrome. Other antiarrhythmic medicines, such as propafenone or procainamide, can also reveal an irregular ECG result and lead to a diagnosis of Brugada syndrome. If the test is negative, your doctor will consider your individual risk of Brugada syndrome and advise if further tests are needed, but you'll probably be able to go home the same day. You may need to have an echocardiography and\/or MRI scan to rule out other heart problems and causes of arrhythmia, and blood tests to measure blood potassium and calcium levels. Genetic testing Genetic testing may also be carried out to identify the defective SCN5A gene that may be causing Brugada syndrome. You and your family may be offered genetic testing if Brugada syndrome is diagnosed in a relative. Learn more about genetic testing. How is it treated?  The only proven effective treatment for Brugada syndrome is having an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) fitted. An ICD is similar to a pacemaker. If the ICD senses your heart is beating at a potentially dangerous abnormal rate, it can deliver treatment, such as an electrical shock, to help return your heart to a normal rhythm and pumping correctly. An ICD won't prevent the arrhythmia, but it can treat them if they happen and help prevent sudden cardiac death. Find out how an ICD is fitted. There are currently no medicines recommended to treat Brugada syndrome. A few simple measures can help to prevent heart rhythm disturbances \u2013 for example, avoiding high temperatures (fever) with paracetamol and treating illnesses such as diarrhoea, which can affect the balance of salts in the body. Information about you If you have Brugada syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. How the heart works The heart has two upper chambers (the left and right atria) and two lower chambers (the left and right ventricles). The atria and ventricles have walls of muscle. A heartbeat happens when this muscle suddenly contracts (tightens) so that the chambers become smaller and the blood inside is squeezed out. The control of the heartbeat starts with a small clump of cells in the right atrium, called the sinoatrial node (the heart's natural pacemaker). This sends out electrical impulses through the atrial muscle to another clump of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node, found between the atria and ventricles. The impulse continues through the AV node and down the fibres that conduct the electrical impulse into the muscle of the ventricles. The AV node determines the rate of contraction of the ventricles. The pulse we can feel when we hold our wrist is the result of the contraction of the ventricles.

They can be very painful, but will normally improve within about three to six weeks. If you think you've injured your ribs, you'll often be able to look after yourself at home. Ribs can't be easily splinted or supported like other bones, so they're usually left to heal naturally. Broken and bruised ribs are generally treated in the same way, so it's not usually necessary to have an X-ray to determine what your exact injury is. You generally only need to seek medical advice if things get worse or don't improve, or if you were injured during a serious accident. See When to see a doctor, below, for more information. How can I tell if I've injured my ribs? A broken or bruised rib will feel very painful, particularly when you breathe in. You may feel you can only take shallow breaths, but it's important you try to breathe normally to help clear mucus from your lungs and prevent chest infections. You may also have some swelling or tenderness in your chest and bruising to the skin. Caring for your injury at home In most cases, you can take care of broken or bruised ribs at home. While your injury heals, pain relief is very important, as it will hurt every time you breathe in or cough. Taking shallow breaths and not coughing to avoid pain will only put you at risk of a chest infection. You can look after yourself by: regularly taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen (aspirin shouldn't be given to children aged under 16) \u2013 follow the dosage instructions on the packet holding an ice pack to your chest regularly during the first few days to reduce the pain and swelling \u2013 a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel will also work resting periodically \u2013 take time off work if you need to, especially if your work involves physical labour or the pain is severe keeping mobile between rest periods \u2013 walking around and moving your shoulders occasionally can help with your breathing and help clear any mucus from your lungs holding a pillow against your chest if you need to cough carrying out breathing exercises \u2013 take 10 slow, deep breaths every hour, letting your lungs inflate fully each time, to help keep your lungs clear Don't wrap a bandage tightly around your chest, as this will stop your lungs expanding properly. Try to avoid lying down or staying still for long periods. It may help to sleep more upright for the first few nights. Avoid straining and lifting heavy objects until you're feeling better, as you may injure yourself further and take longer to recover. If you smoke, stopping may also help your recovery. Get help to stop smoking. When to see a doctor See your GP if your pain hasn't started to improve within a few weeks. They can prescribe stronger painkillers if necessary and refer you to hospital if they feel you need further treatment. Seek medical help immediately if you develop any signs of a more serious problem, such as: increasing shortness of breath increasing chest pain pain in your tummy or shoulder coughing up blood  coughing up yellow or green mucus a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above The above symptoms may indicate a chest infection or may mean a broken rib has damaged your lung, causing the lung to collapse (pneumothorax) or injuring another organ, such as the liver or spleen. Go straight to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department for an assessment if your injury was the result of a serious accident, such as a vehicle collision.

What are bruises? Bruises are bluish or purple-coloured patches that appear on the skin when tiny blood vessels, called capillaries, break or burst underneath. The blood from the capillaries leaks into the soft tissue under your skin, causing the discolouration. Over time, this fades through shades of yellow or green \u2013 usually around two weeks. Bruises often feel tender or swollen at first. What about dark skin and bruising? You can still bruise if you've got dark skin, but they may show up more on fair skin. What causes bruising? Bruising is caused by internal bleeding (under the skin) and occurs when a person has injured themselves. Some people are naturally more likely to bruise than others \u2013 for example, elderly people may bruise more easily because their skin is thinner and the tissue underneath is more fragile.  If you suddenly get lots of bruises, or start to bruise for no obvious reason, tell your GP. Unusual bruising is sometimes a symptom of illness, such as a problem with the way your blood clots.  How can I reduce bruising? Treat bruises on your skin by limiting the bleeding. You can do this by cooling the area with a cold compress (a flannel or cloth soaked in cold water) or an ice pack wrapped in a towel. To make an ice pack, place ice cubes or a packet of frozen vegetables in a plastic bag and wrap them in a towel. Hold this over the area for at least 10 minutes. Do not put the ice pack straight onto your skin as this will be too cold and could hurt.   Most bruises will disappear after around two weeks. If the bruise is still there after two weeks, see your GP. Internal bruising Bruises don't just happen under the skin \u2013 they can also happen deeper in your tissues, organs and bones. While the bleeding isn't visible, the bruises can cause swelling and pain.

People sometimes grind their teeth without it causing any symptoms or problems. But regular, persistent teeth grinding can cause jaw pain and discomfort and wear down your teeth. It can also cause headaches and earache. Read more about the symptoms of bruxism. Most cases of teeth grinding (nearly 80%) occur subconsciously during sleep. It's usually associated with contributing factors, such as stress or anxiety. Bruxism also affects people when they're awake, although this is more likely to be clenching the teeth and jaw, rather than grinding their teeth. Most people do it subconsciously while concentrating or when they're in stressful situations. Many people with bruxism find it will come and go. It's likely to be worse during stressful periods. What causes bruxism? Bruxism almost always occurs in association with other factors. About 70% of bruxism cases that occur during sleep are thought be related to stress and anxiety. There's also an association between bruxism and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). OSA is a sleep disorder where your breathing is interrupted during sleep. How bruxism and OSA affect each other isn't currently fully understood. Teeth grinding can also be caused by taking antipsychotic and antidepressant medication, particularly a type of antidepressant known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Your lifestyle can also have an effect. For example, regularly drinking alcohol, smoking and using recreational drugs such as ecstasy and cocaine increases your risk of bruxism. Doctors sometimes refer to teeth grinding caused by an underlying condition as primary bruxism. Teeth grinding associated with a medication, condition or lifestyle factors is often known as secondary bruxism. Read more about the causes of bruxism. Treating bruxism There are a number of possible treatments for teeth grinding, but only a few have been shown to be effective. Behavioural therapies and the use of mouth guards or mouth splints can be effective in managing the symptoms associated with bruxism. Mouth guards and mouth splints work in the same way by reducing the sensation of clenching or grinding teeth, and also help prevent any wear on the teeth. Other treatments, such as muscle-relaxation exercises and sleep hygiene, may also help manage your symptoms. If you grind your teeth while you're asleep, you may need to wear a mouth guard or mouth splint to protect your teeth from further damage. If you have an anxiety or stress-related problem, a course of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be recommended. The aim of CBT is to help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and how you act. It may be possible to break the habit of teeth grinding using habit-reversal techniques. Making some simple lifestyle changes, such as giving up smoking (if you smoke), reducing your alcohol consumption and managing stress may also help. Read more about treating bruxism. Bruxism is the medical term used to describe teeth grinding and jaw clenching  Who's affected by bruxism? Teeth grinding affects more than six million people in the UK. But the severity of the symptoms and the frequency of grinding varies. It can occur in both children and adults, although it is most common in adults between the ages of 25 and 44.

You will only ever be asked to pay one charge for each complete course of treatment, even if you need to visit your dentist more than once to finish it. If you are referred to another dentist for another, separate course of treatment, you can expect a second charge. Some minor treatments are free.  NHS dental charges Band 1 course of treatment \u2013 £19.70 This covers examinations, diagnosis (including radiographs), advice on how to prevent future problems, scale and polish if clinically necessary, and preventative care (e.g. applications of fluoride varnish or fissure sealant). This band also covers emergency care in a primary care dental practice such as pain relief or a temporary filling. Band 2 course of treatment \u2013 £53.90 This covers everything listed in Band 1, plus any further treatment such as fillings, root canal work or if your dentist needs to take out one or more of your teeth. Band 3 course of treatment \u2013 £233.70 This covers everything listed in Bands 1 and 2, plus crowns, dentures, bridges and other laboratory work. Read the section Understanding NHS dental charges for more detailed information.   Who is entitled to free dental care? You do not have to pay for NHS dental treatment if, when the treatment starts, you are: aged under 18 under 19 and receiving full-time education pregnant or have had a baby in the previous 12 months staying in an NHS hospital and your treatment is carried out by the hospital dentist an NHS hospital dental service outpatient (however, you may have to pay for your dentures or bridges). You do not have to pay if, during the course of treatment, you or your partner, receive: Income Support Income-related Employment and Support Allowance Income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance Pension Credit guarantee credit Universal Credit and meet the criteria or you are named on or entitled to a valid NHS tax credit exemption certificate \u2013 if you don't have a certificate, you can show your award notice; you qualify if you get Child Tax Credits, Working Tax Credits with a disability element (or both) and have income for tax credit purposes of £15,276 or less you are named on a valid HC2 certificate Find out more about the NHS Low Income Scheme (LIS).   Partial help If your name is on a valid HC3 certificate, you may not have to pay for all your treatment. Checks are made on free and reduced cost treatment claims. If you say you have the right to free treatment when you do not, you may incur a penalty charge.  Note You will not be exempt from paying because you receive: Incapacity Benefit, contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance, contribution-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance, Disability Living Allowance, Council Tax Benefit, Housing Benefit or Pension Credit savings credit, when paid on their own. Medical conditions do not exempt patients from payment for dental treatment. You will be asked to show your dentist written proof that you do not have to pay for all or part of your NHS treatment. You will also be asked to sign a form to confirm that you do not have to pay. I am on a low income, how can I get help with NHS charges? If you are on a low income you may be eligible to receive financial help through the NHS Low Income Scheme. To apply for an HC2 certificate, you should complete form HC1, which is available from Jobcentre Plus offices or most NHS hospitals. Your doctor, dentist or optician may be able to give you one, too. You can also get an HC1 form by calling 0845 610 1112. Whether you qualify for help is based on a comparison between your weekly income and assessed requirements at the time the claim is made. For more information about requirements visit NHS: help with health costs. You will qualify for a full-help HC2 certificate (which includes free NHS prescriptions) if your income is less than or equal to your requirements, or your income is greater than your requirements by no more than half the current English prescription charge. You will qualify for a limited-help HC3 certificate if your income is greater than your requirements by more than half the current English prescription charge. The HC3 certificate shows how much you have to pay towards your health costs. Certificates are usually valid for periods of between six months and five years, depending on your circumstances. Find out more about the NHS Low Income Scheme (LIS). Exemption for pregnant women Pregnant women and those who have had a baby in the last 12 months get free NHS dental treatment. You may have to show proof such as a maternity exemption certificate (MatEx), a maternity certificate (MATB1) or your baby's birth certificate. However, if you have given birth more than 12 months ago you will not be entitled to free NHS dental treatment. Please note that your MatEx alone only gives exemption from NHS prescriptions. How do I claim for help with NHS dental charges? Tell your dental practice you want NHS treatment when you make an appointment, and fill out the form you are given when you arrive. If you do not have to pay, put a cross in the appropriate box. If you have a valid HC2 certificate or tax credit exemption certificate, write in the certificate number. If you have a valid HC3 certificate, write in the certificate number and the maximum your certificate says you can pay. You will pay either what appears on the certificate or the actual charge, whichever is the least. You will be asked to show proof of your entitlement to help with dental costs. If you are not sure you are entitled to help, then you must pay. You can claim a refund, but make sure you keep all receipts. How can I claim a refund? Ask your dentist for the NHS receipt form FP64 or a receipt that shows the amount of the NHS charge and the date you paid. If you are claiming on the grounds of low income, complete form HC5 (D): Refund of NHS dental charges  (PDF, 60kb). It tells you where to send the completed form. If you want to claim a refund for another reason, for example, because you are pregnant, have had a baby in the previous 12 months, are aged under 18 or 18 and in full-time education, you will need to explain why you are claiming a refund. Enclose your receipt and make sure you include your full name and the address of your dentist, and write to: NHS Business Services Authority NHS Dental Services PO Box 3181 St Annes Road Eastbourne BN21 9PQ Note: refunds of charges for private dental treatment or sundry items such as toothbrushes cannot be made. Where a course of treatment is a mixture of NHS and private treatment a refund of the NHS charge only can be made.

It causes brain damage that worsens rapidly over time. Symptoms of CJD include: loss of intellect and memory change in personality loss of balance and co-ordination slurred speech vision problems and blindness abnormal jerking movements progressive loss of brain function and mobility Most people with CJD will die within a year of the symptoms starting, usually from infection. This is because the immobility caused by CJD can make people with the condition vulnerable to infection. Read more about the symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and diagnosing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. What causes CJD? CJD appears to be caused by an abnormal infectious protein called a prion. These prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells, resulting in the symptoms described above. While the abnormal prions are technically infectious, they're very different to viruses and bacteria. For example, prions aren't destroyed by the extremes of heat and radiation used to kill bacteria and viruses, and antibiotics or antiviral medicines have no effect on them. Read more about the causes of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Types of CJD There are four main types of CJD, which are described below. Sporadic CJD Sporadic CJD is the most common type. The precise cause of sporadic CJD is unclear, but it's been suggested that a normal brain protein changes abnormally ('misfolds') and turns into a prion. Most cases of sporadic CJD occur in adults aged between 45 and 75. On average, symptoms develop at age 60-65 years. Despite being the most common type of CJD, sporadic CJD is still very rare, affecting only one or two people in every million each year in the UK. In the UK during 2014, there were 90 recorded deaths from sporadic CJD. Variant CJD Variant CJD is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or 'mad cow disease'), a similar prion disease to CJD. Since the link between variant CJD and BSE was discovered in 1996, strict controls have proved very effective in preventing meat from infected cattle from entering the food chain (see preventing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease for more information). However, the average time it takes for the symptoms of variant CJD to occur after initial infection (the incubation period) is still unclear. The incubation period could be very long (over 10 years) in some people, so those exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced can still develop variant CJD. The prion that causes variant CJD can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, although this has only happened four times in the UK. There have been 177 recorded cases of variant CJD in the UK to date and there were no recorded deaths from the condition in the UK during 2014. Familial or inherited CJD Familial CJD is a very rare genetic condition where one of the genes a person inherits from their parent (the prion protein gene) carries a mutation that causes prions to form in their brain during adulthood, triggering the symptoms of CJD. It affects about 1 in every 9 million people in the UK. The symptoms of familial CJD usually first develop in the early 50s. In the UK during 2014, there were 10 deaths from familial CJD and similar inherited prion diseases. Iatrogenic CJD Iatrogenic CJD is where the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment. For example, a common cause of iatrogenic CJD in the past was growth hormone treatment using human pituitary growth hormones extracted from deceased individuals, some of whom were infected with CJD. Synthetic versions of human growth hormone have been used since 1985, so this is no longer a risk. Iatrogenic CJD can also occur if instruments used during brain surgery on a person with CJD aren't properly cleaned between each surgical procedure and are re-used on another person. However, increased awareness of these risks means iatrogenic CJD is now very rare. In the UK during 2014, there were just three deaths from iatrogenic CJD (caused by receiving human growth hormone before 1985). How CJD is treated There's currently no cure for CJD, so treatment aims to relieve symptoms and make the affected person feel as comfortable as possible. This can include using medication such as antidepressants to help with anxiety and depression, and painkillers to relieve pain. Some people will need nursing care and assistance with feeding. Read more about treating Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Information about you If you have CJD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Variant CJD compensation scheme In October 2001, the government announced a compensation scheme for UK victims of variant CJD. A trust fund was set up in April 2001 and payments of £25,000 were made available to most affected families.

It is often used interchangeably with the term \"proptosis\", which means the same thing. What causes exophthalmos? Exophthalmos can be caused by many different conditions. It's important that the underlying cause is identified so appropriate treatment can be given. Thyroid eye disease One of the main causes of exophthalmos in the UK is thyroid eye disease, also known as Graves' ophthalmopathy. This is an autoimmune condition that affects around one in every three people with an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) caused by Graves' disease. It is particularly common in women who are 30-50 years of age and people who smoke. An autoimmune condition is where the immune system (the body's defence against illness and infection) mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In the case of thyroid eye disease, the immune system attacks the muscles and fatty tissues around and behind the eye, causing them to become inflamed (swollen). Graves' disease is an autoimmune condition in which the thyroid is attacked, leading to an increase in the level of thyroid hormones in your blood. It's not clear exactly why thyroid eye disease sometimes occurs along with this condition. Thyroid eye disease can also occasionally affect people with an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) and, in rare cases, people with seemingly normal thyroid function. Other causes Exophthalmos can also have a number of other causes, but these are generally less common than thyroid eye disease. Other cause of exophthalmos can include: an injury to the eyes bleeding behind the eyes abnormally shaped blood vessels behind the eyes an infection of the tissue in the eye socket cancerous tumours \u2013 such as those caused by neuroblastoma and some soft tissue sarcomas Exophthalmos can also affect newborn babies if they are born with eye sockets that are shallower than normal. Other problems associated with exophthalmos Depending on what is causing your bulging eyes, you may also have other associated symptoms. For example, if exophthalmos is caused by a thyroid eye disease, your eyes may also be: inflamed, red and painful dry and \"gritty\" tearful sensitive to light (photophobia) You may also experience some double vision. In severe cases of exophthalmos, you may not be able to close your eyes properly. This can damage your corneas (the transparent tissue that covers the front of your eye) by causing them to dry out. If your corneas become very dry, an infection or ulcers (open sores) may develop. These could damage your vision if left untreated. There is also a small risk of the optic nerve (which transmits signals from the eye to the brain) becoming compressed if you have exophthalmos, which may affect your sight permanently if it is not treated quickly. Seeking medical advice It's important to see your GP or an optometrist (optician) if you notice that one or both of your eyes are protruding, as treatment is often more effective if it's started as soon as possible. If necessary, your GP or optometrist can refer you to an ophthalmologist (a specialist in diagnosing and treating eye conditions) for further assessment. The ophthalmologist will check how well you are able to move your eyes. They may also use an instrument called an exophthalmometer to measure how far your eyeball protrudes. If the ophthalmologist wants to examine your eye socket in more detail, a computerised tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be carried out. You may also have a blood test to assess how well your thyroid gland is working, and you may be referred for an assessment by an endocrinologist (a specialist in conditions affecting glands and hormones) if you are found to have abnormal thyroid hormone levels. Treating exophthalmos If exophthalmos is being caused by thyroid eye disease, the following treatments are often helpful: medication to correct the level of thyroid hormones in your blood \u2013 this will not necessarily improve the problems with your eyes, but may stop them getting worse corticosteroid medication given directly into a vein (intravenously) \u2013 this can help reduce the inflammation associated with the condition corrective surgery \u2013 this may be carried out to improve the appearance of your eyes once the inflammation is under control Other useful measures include stopping smoking, using artificial tears to reduce eye dryness and irritation, and wearing special lenses to correct double vision. In other cases, treatment will vary depending on the underlying cause of the condition. For example, treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and\/or surgery may be recommended if exophthalmos is caused by a tumour. Read more about treating exophthalmos. Outlook The outlook for exophthalmos can vary considerably. Many of the symptoms of thyroid eye disease tend to improve over time, although this can take a number of years, and there is a chance your eyes will continue to protrude if corrective surgery is not carried out. Some people with exophthalmos are left with long-term vision problems, such as double vision, but permanent visual impairment is rare if the condition is identified and treated promptly.

People who have bulimia try to control their weight by severely restricting the amount of food they eat, then binge eating and purging the food from their body by making themselves vomit or using laxatives.  As with other eating disorders, bulimia nervosa can be associated with: low self-esteem alcohol misuse depression self-harm Learn more about the causes of bulimia nervosa. Binge eating and purging Eating disorders are often associated with an abnormal attitude towards food or body image. Everyone has their own eating habits \u2013 for example, people with a food intolerance need to avoid eating certain foods to stay healthy. However, people suffering from eating disorders tend to use their eating habits and behaviours to cope with emotional distress, and often have an abnormal or unrealistic fear of food, calories and being fat. Because of this fear, people with bulimia nervosa tend to restrict their food intake. This results in periods of excessive eating and loss of control (binge eating), after which they make themselves vomit or use laxatives (purging). They purge themselves because they fear that the binging will cause them to gain weight, and usually feel guilty and ashamed of their behaviour. This is why these behaviours are usually done in secret. Such binge-purge cycles can be triggered by hunger or stress, or are a way to cope with emotional anxiety. Warning signs Signs of bulimia nervosa include an obsessive attitude towards food and eating, an overcritical attitude to their weight and shape, and frequent visits to the bathroom after eating, after which the person might appear flushed and have scarred knuckles (from forcing fingers down the throat to bring on vomiting). Read more about the symptoms and warning signs of bulimia. Bulimia can eventually lead to physical problems associated with poor nutrient intake, excessive vomiting or overuse of laxatives. Read more about these complications of bulimia. Who is affected by bulimia nervosa? As with all eating disorders, women are much more likely to develop bulimia than men. However, bulimia nervosa is becoming increasingly common in boys and men. There are an estimated 1.6 million Britons suffering from some form of eating disorder, and reports estimate that up to 25% may be male. Recent studies suggest that as many as 8% of women have bulimia at some stage in their life. The condition can occur at any age, but mainly affects women aged between 16 and 40 (on average, it starts around the age of 18 or 19). Bulimia nervosa can affect children, but this is extremely rare.  What to do If you have an eating disorder such as bulimia, the first step is to recognise that you have a problem. Then, you need to visit your GP for a medical check-up and advice on how to get treatment. If you think someone you know has bulimia nervosa, talk to them and try to persuade them to see their GP. There are also many support groups and charities you can approach for help, including: beat: beating eating disorders Mental Health Foundation  Anorexia and Bulimia Care MGEDT: Men Get Eating Disorders Too Read about diagnosing bulimia. The first step towards getting better is to recognise the problem and to have a genuine desire to get well. There is strong evidence that self-help books can be effective for many people with bulimia nervosa, especially if they ask a friend or family member to work through it with them. If this is not suitable or is unsuccessful, your GP can refer you for treatment to an eating disorder service, where you may be offered a structured programme of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Some people may also benefit from antidepressant medication (fluoxetine), as this can reduce the urges to binge and vomit. Read more about the treatment of bulimia.

People who binge eat consume very large quantities of food over a short period of time, even when they are not hungry. Binges are often planned in advance and can involve the person buying \"special\" binge foods. In rare cases, people describe themselves as being in a \"dazed state\" during a binge \u2013 particularly binges during the night \u2013 and they are not able to recall what they ate. People who binge eat feel they have no control over their eating. They often binge in private because they feel embarrassed, guilty or disgusted with their behaviour after they have finished eating. Episodes of binge eating sometimes alternate with periods where the person cuts down on the amount of food they eat. This can lead to a vicious cycle that is difficult to break \u2013 where blood sugar levels rise and fall rapidly, and false messages are sent to the brain, which result in cravings for food when your body doesn't need it. Who is affected Anyone can be affected by binge eating. While the condition is slightly more common in women than men, the numbers of men and women affected are more equal than in other eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa. The condition tends to first develop in young adults, although many people do not seek help until they are in their 30s or 40s. It\u2019s estimated that there is around a 1 in 30 to 1 in 50 chance of a person developing binge eating disorder at some point during their life. Getting help Many people will occasionally binge on food \u2013 this doesn't necessarily mean you have a binge eating disorder. However, you should see your GP if you binge regularly and excessively, particularly if the binges are having an effect on your physical and\/or mental health. Your GP can diagnose the condition and may be able to refer you to a specialist, such as a psychiatrist or a psychologist. Your GP will ask you about your eating habits and look for the following signs: you eat much faster than normal during a binge you eat until you feel uncomfortably full you eat a large amount of food when you are not hungry you eat alone or secretly due to being embarrassed about the amount of food you are consuming you have feelings of guilt, shame or disgust after binge eating People who regularly eat this way are likely to have a binge eating disorder. What causes binge eating? It's not clear what causes binge eating, but, like most eating disorders, it's seen as a way of coping with feelings of unhappiness and low self-esteem. Things that may increase your risk of developing problems with binge eating include: low self-esteem and a lack of confidence depression or anxiety feelings of stress, anger, boredom or loneliness dissatisfaction with your body and feeling under pressure to be thin stressful or traumatic events in your past a family history of eating disorders, which may be related to your genes differences in your brain or the level of hormones produced by your brain compared to people who don't binge eat Binge eating can sometimes develop following a strict diet, particularly if you skipped meals, cut certain foods out and didn't eat enough food. These are unhealthy ways to lose weight and may mean you're more likely to binge at another time.   How binge eating is treated Binge eating is treatable and most people eventually get better with appropriate help and support. The main treatments are: self-help programmes \u2013 this may be individually with a book or online course, or as part of a self-help support group guided self-help (self-help supervised by regular contacts with a professional) specialist group intervention individual (one-to-one) psychological therapy \u2013 such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) medication called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) These treatments can help you overcome the psychological issues associated with your binge eating, but they won't usually have a significant impact on your weight. If you are overweight, a healthcare professional may also draw up a weight loss plan to follow during treatment or after any psychological issues have been dealt with. Read more about treating binge eating. Risks of binge eating Binge eating can be associated with serious psychological problems, including depression and anxiety disorders. These feelings can be made worse over time while the person is still binge eating. A common physical effect of binge eating is weight gain, which can lead to obesity. This can put you at risk of a number of related physical health problems, some of which can be life-threatening. These include: high cholesterol and high blood pressure \u2013 which can increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease and stroke diabetes \u2013 a long-term condition that causes your blood sugar level to become too high osteoarthritis \u2013 a condition that causes pain and swelling in the joints some types of cancer \u2013 such as breast cancer and bowel cancer Therefore, it's important to seek help if you think you may have a binge eating problem, because you may need support to help you tackle both your psychological and physical problems. Binge eating and bulimia Although binge eating is similar to another eating disorder called bulimia, the two conditions are different. In people with bulimia, periods of binge eating are followed by attempts to purge (flush out) the food they have eaten \u2013 for example, by making themselves vomit or by taking laxatives. People who binge eat do not purge themselves to control their weight, but may try to limit weight gain by having periods of eating very little between binges.

A person with an eating disorder may focus excessively on their weight and shape, leading them to make unhealthy choices about food with damaging results to their health. Types of eating disorders Eating disorders include a range of conditions that can affect someone physically, psychologically and socially. The most common eating disorders are:  anorexia nervosa \u2013 when a person tries to keep their weight as low as possible; for example, by starving themselves or exercising excessively bulimia \u2013 when a person goes through periods of binge eating and is then deliberately sick or uses laxatives (medication to help empty the bowels) to try to control their weight binge eating disorder (BED) \u2013 when a person feels compelled to overeat large amounts of food in a short space of time Some people, particularly those who are young, may be diagnosed with an eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS). This means you have some, but not all, of the typical signs of eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia. What causes eating disorders? Eating disorders are often blamed on the social pressure to be thin, as young people in particular feel they should look a certain way. However, the causes are usually more complex. An eating disorder may be associated with biological, genetic or environmental factors combined with a particular event that triggers the disorder. There may also be other factors that maintain the illness.  Risk factors that can increase the likelihood of a person having an eating disorder include: having a family history of eating disorders, depression or substance misuse being criticised for their eating habits, body shape or weight being overly concerned with being slim, particularly if combined with pressure to be slim from society or for a job \u2013 for example, ballet dancers, models or athletes certain underlying characteristics \u2013 for example, having an obsessive personality, an anxiety disorder, low self-esteem or being a perfectionist particular experiences, such as sexual or emotional abuse or the death of someone special difficult relationships with family members or friends stressful situations \u2013 for example, problems at work, school or university Do I have an eating disorder? Doctors sometimes use a questionnaire to help identify people who may have an eating disorder. The questionnaire asks the following five questions: Do you make yourself sick because you feel uncomfortably full? Do you worry you have lost control over how much you eat? Have you recently lost more than one stone (six kilograms) in a three-month period? Do you believe yourself to be fat when others say you are too thin? Would you say food dominates your life? If you answer \"yes\" to two or more of these questions, you may have an eating disorder. Spotting an eating disorder in others It can often be very difficult to identify that a loved one or friend has developed an eating disorder. Warning signs to look out for include: missing meals complaining of being fat, even though they have a normal weight or are underweight repeatedly weighing themselves and looking at themselves in the mirror making repeated claims that they've already eaten, or they'll shortly be going out to eat somewhere else and avoiding eating at home cooking big or complicated meals for other people, but eating little or none of the food themselves only eating certain low-calorie foods in your presence, such as lettuce or celery feeling uncomfortable or refusing to eat in public places, such as at a restaurant the use of \"pro-anorexia\" websites It can be difficult to know what to do if you're concerned about a friend or family member. It's not unusual for someone with an eating disorder to be secretive and defensive about their eating and their weight, and they may deny being unwell. Read more about approaching and talking to your child about eating disorders and supporting someone with an eating disorder. You can also talk in confidence to an adviser from the eating disorders charity Beat by calling their helpline on 0345 634 1414. They also have a designated youth helpline on 0345 634 7650. Who's affected by eating disorders? A 2015 report commissioned by Beat estimates more than 725,000 people in the UK are affected by an eating disorder. Eating disorders tend to be more common in certain age groups, but they can affect people of any age. Around 1 in 250 women and 1 in 2,000 men will experience anorexia nervosa at some point. The condition usually develops around the age of 16 or 17. Bulimia is around two to three times more common than anorexia nervosa, and 90% of people with the condition are female. It usually develops around the age of 18 or 19. Binge eating affects males and females equally and usually appears later in life, between the ages of 30 and 40. As it's difficult to precisely define binge eating, it's not clear how widespread it is, but it's estimated to affect around 5% of the adult population. Treating eating disorders If an eating disorder isn't treated, it can have a negative impact on someone's job or schoolwork, and can disrupt relationships with family members and friends. The physical effects of an eating disorder can sometimes be fatal. Treatment for eating disorders is available, although recovery can take a long time. It's important that the person affected wants to get better, and the support of family and friends is invaluable. Treatment usually involves monitoring a person's physical health while helping them deal with the underlying psychological causes.

It's caused by a problem with the immune system, but usually goes away on its own within a few years. In the meantime, blisters can be controlled with medication. About 1 in 10,000 people are affected by the condition in the UK each year. What are the symptoms? Bullous pemphigoid typically starts with a red, itchy rash that looks a bit like dermatitis (a type of eczema) or hives. This tends to last several weeks or months. Groups of large, itchy blisters usually then appear on the red patches, just beneath the surface of the skin. They can be up to 5cm in diameter and full of fluid, with the thick skin of the blisters stretched tightly. The fluid inside is usually clear, but can turn cloudy or bloodstained. Blisters last a few days before healing without leaving a scar, but a cycle develops where more form. The rash and blisters are usually seen on the upper arms and thighs, sometimes spreading to body folds and the tummy. In severe cases, the blisters may cover most of the skin, including the inside of the mouth. However, some people have no symptoms or just have mild redness and irritation without blisters. Who is affected? The condition is usually seen in older people aged over 70. Rarely, it can affect children and younger adults.  Bullous pemphigoid is also slightly more common in women than men. What is the cause? Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune condition, which means the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. The person's immune system produces antibodies against the skin. These antibodies attack the basement membrane, which lies between the skin's top layer (epidermis) and the next layer (dermis), and holds the skin together. The skin layers start to separate and fluid builds up in between. It's not understood why autoimmune diseases like bullous pemphigoid happen, but it's thought something triggers the immune system to attack the body's own tissues. Certain medicines and sunburn have been known to act as a trigger. Symptoms usually come on unexpectedly. Bullous pemphigoid isn't: infectious caused by an allergy affected by diet or lifestyle How is it diagnosed? Your GP may suspect bullous pemphigoid just by looking at your skin. The diagnosis is then confirmed by taking a small sample of your affected skin (biopsy) and sending it to a laboratory to be inspected to see if the top layers of skin have separated. Special staining (immunofluorescence) may be used to show up the antibodies, and a blood sample may be taken and checked for the presence of pemphigoid antibodies. How is it treated? If you've been diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid, you'll probably be referred to a dermatologist (skin specialist) for treatment. The aim of treatment is to stop new blisters forming and heal the blisters that are already there. Your specialist may prescribe quite powerful medication with potentially severe side effects, so the smallest possible dose is used to minimise this. You'll usually be prescribed corticosteroids (either tablets or cream), sometimes alongside \"steroid-sparing\" medication that allows doctors to reduce the dose of steroids. You may also be prescribed an antibiotic. Corticosteroids Corticosteroids, or steroids, are an anti-inflammatory medicine prescribed for a wide range of conditions.   If the affected area of skin is only small, you may be prescribed steroid cream to rub into the area. For larger areas of blisters, you may be given steroid tablets. If the blisters are severe, you may be given a high dose to start with to get the condition under control and stop the blisters appearing. This may take several weeks. The dose is then gradually reduced, and you'll either come off the steroids or be kept on a low dose for a long time. To use the lowest possible effective dose of steroids, your doctor may give you \"steroid-sparing\" medicine to take alongside, which is described below. Read more about steroid medicines, including the side effects. Tablets to suppress your immune system You may be prescribed azathioprine or methotrexate medicine to take alongside steroids. These work by suppressing your production of antibodies. The idea is that side effects will be less troublesome if low doses of two different tablets (steroids and immunosuppressants) are used instead of one high dose of steroids. This is known as steroid sparing. Looking after your skin Blisters should be left intact, if possible, to reduce your risk of infection. However, if they're particularly large and in a difficult place \u2013 such as the sole of your foot \u2013 they may be carefully pierced with a sterile needle to release the fluid. The skin of the blister should be left. If blisters do break, they heal quickly. Outlook It's not possible to cure the condition with treatment, but it usually goes away on its own within five to six years. In the meantime, medication is effective in keeping the blisters under control. Regular follow-up appointments are usually necessary in the meantime so any side effects of the medication can be monitored, and to make sure the symptoms are under control. Information about you If you have bullous pemphigoid, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

The main sign of a bunion is the big toe pointing towards the other toes on the same foot, which may force the foot bone attached to it (the first metatarsal) to stick outwards. Other symptoms may include: a swollen, bony bump on the outside edge of your foot pain and swelling over your big toe joint that's made worse by pressure from wearing shoes hard, callused and red skin caused by your big toe and second toe overlapping sore skin over the top of the bunion changes to the shape of your foot, making it difficult to find shoes that fit These symptoms can sometimes get worse if the bunion is left untreated, so it's best to see a GP. They'll ask you about your symptoms and examine your foot. In some cases, an X-ray may be recommended to assess the severity of your bunion. Anyone can develop a bunion, but they're more common in women than men. This may be because of the style of footwear that women wear. What causes bunions? The exact cause of bunions is unknown, but they tend to run in families. Wearing badly fitting shoes is thought to make bunions worse. It's also thought that bunions are more likely to occur in people with unusually flexible joints, which is why bunions sometimes occur in children. In some cases, certain health conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout, may also be responsible. Read more about the causes of bunions. Treating bunions There are a number of treatment options for bunions. Non-surgical treatments are usually tried first, including painkillers, orthotics (insoles) and bunion pads. However, these can only help to reduce the symptoms of bunions, such as pain. They don't improve the appearance of your foot. Surgery may be considered if your symptoms are severe and don't respond to non-surgical treatments. The type of surgery will depend on the level of deformity, the severity of your symptoms, your age, and any other associated medical conditions. Read more about treating bunions.  Complications If bunions aren't treated, they can lead to further problems. For example, they can cause arthritis in your big toe and push your second toe out of place. Problems can also develop after bunion surgery. While surgery is usually effective (symptoms are improved in 85% of cases), bunions can sometimes return. In less than 10% of cases, complications occur after bunion surgery. These will depend on the type of surgery you have and can include: stiffness in your toe joints a delay or failure of the bone to heal, or the bone healing in the wrong position pain under the ball of your foot damage to the nerves in your foot prolonged swelling and continued pain the need for further surgery Read more about the complications of bunions. Preventing bunions The best way to reduce your chances of developing bunions is to wear shoes that fit properly. Shoes that are too tight or have high heels can force your toes together. Bunions are rare in populations that don\u2019t wear shoes. Make sure your shoes are the correct size and that there's enough room to move your toes freely. It's best to avoid wearing shoes with high heels or pointy toes.

Both are treated in the same way. A burn is caused by dry heat \u2013 by an iron or fire, for example. A scald is caused by something wet, such as hot water or steam. Burns can be very painful and may cause: red or peeling skin blisters  swelling white or charred skin The amount of pain you feel isn't always related to how serious the burn is. Even a very serious burn may be relatively painless. Treating burns and scalds To treat a burn, follow the first aid advice below: immediately get the person away from the heat source to stop the burning cool the burn with cool or lukewarm running water for 20 minutes \u2013 don't use ice, iced water, or any creams or greasy substances such as butter remove any clothing or jewellery that's near the burnt area of skin, including babies' nappies - but don't move anything that's stuck to the skin make sure the person keeps warm \u2013 by using a blanket, for example, but take care not to rub it against the burnt area cover the burn by placing a layer of cling film over it \u2013 a clean plastic bag could also be used for burns on your hand use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat any pain if the face or eyes are burnt, sit up as much as possible, rather than lying down - this helps to reduce swelling The British Red Cross website has a video about first aid for burns. Read more about treating burns and scalds. When to get medical attention Depending on how serious a burn is, it may be possible to treat it at home. For minor burns, keep the burn clean and don't burst any blisters that form. More serious burns require professional medical attention. You should go to a hospital A&E department for: all chemical and electrical burns large or deep burns \u2013 any burn bigger than your hand burns that cause white or charred skin \u2013 any size burns on the face, hands, arms, feet, legs or genitals that cause blisters If someone has breathed in smoke or fumes, they should also seek medical attention. Some symptoms may be delayed and can include: coughing a sore throat difficulty breathing facial burns People at greater risk from the effects of burns, such as children under five years old and pregnant women, should also get medical attention after a burn or scald. The size and depth of the burn will be assessed and the affected area cleaned before a dressing is applied. In severe cases, skin graft surgery may be recommended. Read more about: recovering from burns and scalds  complications of burns and scalds Types of burn Burns are assessed by how seriously your skin is damaged and which layers of skin are affected. Your skin has three layers: the epidermis \u2013 the outer layer of skin the dermis \u2013 the layer of tissue just beneath, which contains blood capillaries, nerve endings, sweat glands and hair follicles  the subcutaneous fat, or subcutis \u2013 the deeper layer of fat and tissue There are four main types of burn, which tend to have a different appearance and different symptoms: superficial epidermal burn \u2013 where the epidermis is damaged; your skin will be red, slightly swollen and painful, but not blistered superficial dermal burn \u2013 where the epidermis and part of the dermis are damaged; your skin will be pale pink and painful, and there may be small blisters deep dermal or partial thickness burn \u2013 where the epidermis and the dermis are damaged: this type of burn makes your skin turn red and blotchy; your skin may be dry or moist, and become swollen and blistered, and it may be very painful or painless full thickness burn \u2013 where all three layers of skin (the epidermis, dermis and subcutis) are damaged; the skin is often burnt away and the tissue underneath may appear pale or blackened, while the remaining skin will be dry and white, brown or black with no blisters, and the texture of the skin may also be leathery or waxy Preventing burns and scalds Many severe burns and scalds affect babies and young children. Examples of things you can do to help reduce the likelihood of your child having a serious accident at home include: keeping your child out of the kitchen whenever possible testing the temperature of bath water using your elbow before you put your baby or toddler in the bath keeping matches, lighters and lit candles out of young children's sight and reach keeping hot drinks well away from young children Read more about preventing burns and scalds. Further advice If you need advice about a burn or scald, you can: call NHS 111 go to a minor injuries unit (MIU) go to an NHS walk-in centre call or see your GP Use the services directory to find minor injury units and walk-in centres near you.

A bursa is a fluid-filled sac which forms under the skin, usually over the joints, and acts as a cushion between the tendons and bones. The main symptoms of bursitis are pain, swelling and tenderness in the affected area. Any bursa can become inflamed, but bursitis most commonly occurs in the: shoulder elbow  knee (known as housemaid's knee) hip Other areas affected can include the ankle, foot and Achilles tendon (the large tendon that attaches the heel bone to the calf muscle).  What causes bursitis? A bursa can become inflamed through injury or repetitive movement. Your risk of developing bursitis is increased if you regularly take part in physical activities that involve a lot of repetitive movement, for example running (bursitis in the ankle) or playing darts (bursitis in the elbow). People who spend a lot of time kneeling, such as carpet fitters and gardeners, also have an increased risk of developing bursitis in their knee. Less commonly, bursitis can develop as a result of an infection or as a complication of certain conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis. Read more about the causes of bursitis. Treating bursitis Most cases of bursitis can be treated at home. Resting the affected area, using an ice pack (a frozen bag of vegetables wrapped in a tea towel works well) to reduce inflammation, and taking painkillers such as aspirin, paracetamol and ibuprofen will help relieve your symptoms and speed up your recovery. The pain usually improves within a few weeks, but the swelling may take longer to completely disappear. See your GP if your symptoms do not improve after two weeks. Read more about treating bursitis. Preventing bursitis Taking precautions, such as wearing knee pads when kneeling and warming up properly before exercise, may help reduce your risk of getting bursitis.

They act as cushions between two surfaces that rub against each other, such as bones, muscles, joints and tendons.  Each bursa is lined with special cells called synovial cells. The cells produce a liquid that lubricates the body's moving parts and helps reduce friction.
