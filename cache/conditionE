It's not usually serious and most people get better within a few days without treatment. In most cases of food poisoning, the food is contaminated by bacteria, such as salmonella or Escherichia coli (E. coli), or a virus, such as the norovirus. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of food poisoning usually begin within one to two days of eating contaminated food, although they may start at any point between a few hours and several weeks later. The main symptoms include: feeling sick (nausea) vomiting diarrhoea, which may contain blood or mucus stomach cramps and abdominal (tummy) pain a lack of energy and weakness loss of appetite a high temperature (fever) aching muscles chills In most cases, these symptoms will pass in a few days and you will make a full recovery. What to do Most people with food poisoning recover at home and don't need any specific treatment, although there are some situations where you should see your GP for advice (see below). Until you feel better, you should rest and drink fluids to prevent dehydration. Try to drink plenty of water, even if you can only sip it. Eat when you feel up to it, but try small, light meals at first and stick to bland foods \u2013 such as toast, crackers, bananas and rice \u2013 until you begin to feel better. Oral rehydration solutions (ORS), which are available from pharmacies, are recommended for more vulnerable people, such as the elderly and those with another health condition. Read more about treating food poisoning. When to see your GP You should contact your GP if: your symptoms are severe \u2013 for example, if you're unable to keep down any fluids because you are vomiting repeatedly your symptoms don't start to improve after a few days you have symptoms of severe dehydration, such as confusion, a rapid heartbeat, sunken eyes and passing little or no urine you're pregnant you're over 60 your baby or young child has suspected food poisoning you have a long-term underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), heart valve disease, diabetes or kidney disease you have a weak immune system \u2013 for example, because of medication, cancer treatment or HIV In these situations, your GP may send off a stool sample for analysis and prescribe antibiotics, or they may refer you to hospital so you can be looked after more closely. How is food contaminated? Food can become contaminated at any stage during production, processing or cooking. For example, it can be contaminated by: not cooking food thoroughly (particularly meat) not correctly storing food that needs to be chilled at below 5C leaving cooked food for too long at warm temperatures not sufficiently reheating previously cooked food someone who is ill or who has dirty hands touching the food eating food that has passed its \"use by\" date the spread of bacteria between contaminated foods (cross-contamination) Foods particularly susceptible to contamination if not handled, stored or cooked properly include: raw meat and poultry raw eggs raw shellfish unpasteurised milk \"ready-to-eat\" foods, such as cooked sliced meats, pâté, soft cheeses and pre-packed sandwiches Read more about the causes of food poisoning and preventing food poisoning.

E. coli O157 is found in the gut and faeces of many animals, particularly cattle. It is an uncommon cause of gastroenteritis but can be caught by: Eating contaminated food (such as raw leafy vegetables or undercooked meat). Always wash all vegetables (including salad leaves) that will be eaten raw, unless they have been pre-prepared and are labelled \u2018ready to eat\u2019. Washing may reduce the risk of infection, but will not eliminate any risk of infection completely.  Touching infected animals or accidentally coming into contact with their faeces. Contact with people who have the illness, particularly if you do not wash your hands thoroughly after using the toilet or before handling food. Drinking water from inadequately treated water supplies. Swimming or playing in contaminated water, such as ponds or streams. Symptoms of E. coli O157 infection Symptoms include diarrhoea, stomach cramps and occasionally fever. About half of people with the infection will have bloody diarrhoea. People usually notice symptoms three to four days after they have been infected, but symptoms can start any time between one and 14 days afterwards. These symptoms can last up to two weeks. A small number of people with E. coli O157 infection go on to develop a serious condition called haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). This can sometimes lead to kidney failure and death, although this is rare. The risk of HUS is highest in children aged under five years. Some people become infected but don't develop symptoms. Find out more about gastroenteritis. Treatment and care at home There is no specific treatment for E. coli O157 infection. People who are infected can usually be cared for at home and most will get better without medical treatment. It is important to drink plenty of fluids, as diarrhoea can lead to dehydration. You should contact your GP or call NHS 111 as soon as possible if you or your child has bloody diarrhoea. Antibiotics are not recommended, and may increase the risk of complications. Anti-diarrhoea drugs such as loperamide (Imodium) are also not recommended as they may prolong your exposure to the toxin. Find out more about caring for a child with gastroenteritis and caring for an adult with gastroenteritis. How to prevent E. coli O157 from spreading at home Strict hygiene measures are essential to stop others getting infected. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap in running water and dry them completely. Use liquid soap and warm water if you can. Everyone must wash their hands after contact with an infected person, particularly after handling their clothes or bedding. Always wash hands after going to the toilet or changing babies\u2019 nappies, and before preparing or serving food or eating meals. Anyone who has been infected should avoid cooking or preparing food until 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared up. Do not share towels or nappy changing mats. Wash soiled clothing and bed linen separately from other clothes in a washing machine at the highest temperature possible (e.g. 60°C). Wipe down the outside of the washing machine with hot water and detergent after any heavily soiled load. After handling soiled bedclothes or clothing, wash your hands thoroughly. Clean toilet seats, toilet flush handles, basin taps, surfaces and toilet door handles at least daily, preferably more often, using hot water and detergent. Disinfection sprays and wipes or alcohol-based wipes may be used on toilet seats and other surfaces, but only after any visible soiling has been removed. Thick household bleach is highly effective. Dilute one part bleach to every 10 parts water for soiled surfaces and one part bleach to every 100 parts water for other hard surfaces. Ideally, use heavy-duty domestic rubber gloves and disposable cloths for cleaning. Dispose of cloths by placing them in a plastic bag, sealing the neck and placing in household waste. Thoroughly wash rubber gloves in hot water and detergent after use, then rinse and allow to dry. Do not clean soiled items in the kitchen. Deal with any spillage of faeces immediately. Clean the soiled area with hot water and detergent using heavy-duty domestic rubber gloves. Clean gloves (as above) and wash hands thoroughly. Returning to work or school Anyone who has had an E. coli O157 infection should stay away from work or school until they have been completely free of symptoms for 48 hours. Most people are no longer infectious after about a week, although some people, particularly children, may carry E. coli O157 for several months after they have got better. Some people need to take special care before returning to work or school: If you work in health or social care, or your work involves handling food, you should ask your local authority environmental health officers about when it is safe to return to work. This advice applies to both people who have been infected and those who live in the same household as someone who has. If you have a child under five years of age who has had E. coli, or lives with someone who has, you should talk to your GP about when it is safe for your child to return to school or nursery. Children under five years of age who have had an E. coli O157 infection should not swim in public swimming pools, or share paddling pools with others, until they have had test results showing that they are no longer an infection risk to others.

Anyone can develop a middle ear infection but infants between six and 15 months old are most commonly affected. It's estimated that around one in every four children experience at least one middle ear infection by the time they're 10 years old. Symptoms of a middle ear infection In most cases, the symptoms of a middle ear infection (otitis media) develop quickly and resolve in a few days. This is known as acute otitis media. The main symptoms include: earache a high temperature (fever) being sick a lack of energy slight hearing loss \u2013 if the middle ear becomes filled with fluid, hearing loss may be a sign of glue ear, also known as otitis media with effusion In some cases, a hole may develop in the eardrum (perforated eardrum) and pus may run out of the ear. The earache, which is caused by the build-up of fluid stretching the eardrum, then resolves. Signs in young children As babies are unable to communicate the source of their discomfort, it can be difficult to tell what's wrong with them. Signs that a young child might have an ear infection include: pulling, tugging or rubbing their ear irritability, poor feeding or restlessness at night coughing or a runny nose diarrhoea unresponsiveness to quiet sounds or other signs of difficulty hearing, such as inattentiveness loss of balance When to seek medical advice Most cases of otitis media pass within a few days, so there's usually no need to see your GP. However, see your GP if you or your child have: symptoms showing no sign of improvement after two or three days a lot of pain a discharge of pus or fluid from the ear \u2013 some people develop a persistent and painless ear discharge that lasts for many months, known as chronic suppurative otitis media an underlying health condition, such as cystic fibrosis or congenital heart disease, which could make complications more likely Read more about diagnosing middle ear infections. How middle ear infections are treated Most ear infections clear up within three to five days and don't need any specific treatment. If necessary, paracetamol or ibuprofen should be used to relieve pain and a high temperature. Make sure any painkillers you give to your child are appropriate for their age. Read more about giving your child painkillers. Antibiotics aren't routinely used to treat middle ear infections, although they may occasionally be prescribed if symptoms persist or are particularly severe. Read more about treating middle ear infections. What causes middle ear infections? Most middle ear infections occur when an infection such as a cold, leads to a build-up of mucus in the middle ear and causes the Eustachian tube (a thin tube that runs from the middle ear to the back of the nose) to become swollen or blocked. This mean mucus can't drain away properly, making it easier for an infection to spread into the middle ear. An enlarged adenoid (soft tissue at the back of the throat) can also block the Eustachian tube. The adenoid can be removed if it causes persistent or frequent ear infections. Read more about removing adenoids. Younger children are particularly vulnerable to middle ear infections as: the Eustachian tube is smaller in children than in adults a child's adenoids are relatively much larger than an adults Certain conditions can also increase the risk of middle ear infections, including: having a cleft palate \u2013 a type of birth defect where a child has a split in the roof of their mouth having Down's syndrome \u2013 a genetic condition that typically causes some level of learning disability and a characteristic range of physical features Can middle ear infections be prevented? It's not possible to prevent middle ear infections, but there are some things you can do that may reduce your child's risk of developing the condition. These include: make sure your child is up-to-date with their routine vaccinations \u2013 particularly the pneumococcal vaccine and the DTaP\/IPV\/Hib (5-in-1) vaccine avoid exposing your child to smoky environments (passive smoking) don't give your child a dummy once they're older than six to 12 months old don't feed your child while they're lying flat on their back if possible, feed your baby with breast milk rather than formula milk Avoiding contact with other children who are unwell may also help reduce your child's chances of catching an infection that could lead to a middle ear infection. Further problems Complications of middle ear infections are fairly rare, but can be serious if they do occur. Most complications are the result of the infection spreading to another part of the ear or head, including: the bones behind the ear (mastoiditis) the inner ear (labyrinthitis) the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) If complications do develop, they often need to be treated immediately with antibiotics in hospital.

Otitis externa is often referred to as \"swimmer's ear\" because repeated exposure to water can make the ear canal more vulnerable to inflammation. Symptoms of otitis externa include: ear pain, which can be severe itchiness in the ear canal a discharge of liquid or pus from the ear some degree of temporary hearing loss Usually only one ear is affected. With treatment, these symptoms should clear up within a few days. However, some cases can persist for several months or longer. Read more about the symptoms of otitis externa. When to see your GP You should see your GP if you may have otitis externa. Your GP will ask about your symptoms and whether you regularly use any items that are inserted into your ears, such as hearing aids or ear plugs. They may also examine inside your ear using an instrument called an otoscope. If you have recurring episodes of otitis externa that haven't responded to treatment, your GP may take a swab of the inside of your ear. This will be tested to help determine what type of infection you have, if any, so appropriate medication can be prescribed. What causes otitis externa? Most cases of otitis externa are caused by a bacterial infection, although the condition can also be caused by: irritation fungal infections allergies There are a number of things that can make you more likely to develop otitis externa, including: damaging the skin inside your ear regularly getting water in your ear Getting water in your ear is particularly significant, because this can cause you to scratch inside your ear, and the moisture also provides an ideal environment for bacteria to grow. Read more about the causes of otitis externa. Who is affected? Otitis externa is relatively common. It's estimated that around 1 in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their lives. The condition is slightly more common in women than men and is most often diagnosed in adults aged 45 to 75. People with certain long-term (chronic) conditions are at greater risk of developing the condition. These include: eczema asthma allergic rhinitis How otitis externa is treated Otitis externa sometimes gets better without treatment, but it can take several weeks. Your GP can prescribe ear drop medication that usually improves the symptoms within a few days. There are a number of different types of ear drops that may be used to treat otitis externa, but they all tend to be used several times a day for about a week.  Your GP may refer you to a specialist for further treatment and advice if symptoms are severe or they fail to respond to treatment. Read more about treating otitis externa. Preventing otitis externa To help reduce your chances of developing otitis externa, you should avoid inserting cotton wool buds and other things into your ears (including your fingers), as this can damage the sensitive skin in your ear canal. If you're a regular swimmer, consider using ear plugs when swimming or wearing a swimming cap to cover your ears and protect them from water. You should also try to avoid getting water, soap or shampoo into your ears when you have a shower or bath. Read more about preventing otitis externa. Complications Complications of otitis externa are uncommon, but some can be very serious. One rare complication of otitis externa is malignant otitis externa, which is where an infection spreads from the ear canal into the surrounding bone. This requires prompt treatment with antibiotics and sometimes surgery, as it can be fatal if left untreated. Read more about the complications of otitis externa.

Pinning back the ears is known as an otoplasty, or pinnaplasty. It's usually carried out on children and young teenagers, although adults may wish to have it done, too. An otoplasty isn't suitable for children younger than five as their ears will still be growing and developing.  Most people are happy with the results of an otoplasty, and generally it's a safe procedure. But it can be expensive and there are still risks to consider. Read on to find out: How much does it cost?  Where do I go?  What does it involve?  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems  More information  How much does it cost? In the UK, ear correction surgery costs about £2,500-£3,500, plus the cost of any consultations or follow-up care that may be needed. It would only be carried out on the NHS under exceptional circumstances \u2013 for example, in rare cases where a person's ears are causing them significant psychological distress.  Where do I go? If you're looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform ear correction surgery.  All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC. The CQC publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. Also, research the surgeon who is going to carry out the operation. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor's fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many ear operations they've performed where there have been complications what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? An otoplasty for an older child or adult can be done under local anaesthetic by either a plastic surgeon or an ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon. It generally involves: making one small cut (incision) behind the ear to expose the ear cartilage removing small pieces of cartilage if necessary  scoring and stitching the remaining structure into the desired shape and position Or, you may be offered a newer technique that involves scoring the cartilage through the ear skin using a needle. No incision is made, but there's not much good evidence about the long-term quality or safety of this method.  Read the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on incisionless otoplasty. An otoplasty usually takes one to two hours. If local anaesthetic is used, you are able to go home the same day. Recovery During the first few days after surgery, your ears may be sore and tender or numb. You may have a slight tingling sensation for a few weeks. You may need to wear a bandage around your head for the first few days to protect your ears from infection. You won't be able to wash your hair during this time. Some surgeons recommend wearing a head band at night for several weeks to protect the ears while you sleep. There may be some slight bruising, which can last about two weeks. You may want to delay returning to work or school until the bruising has disappeared.  Sometimes the stitches may come to the surface of the skin or cause the ear to feel tender. Pain and discomfort can be treated with over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. You need to avoid swimming and activities that put your ears at risk of injury \u2013 such as judo or rugby \u2013 for several weeks. Within 5 to 10 days: Stitches are removed (unless they were dissolvable stitches) and any bandage would probably come off. After a week or two: Most children would be able to return to school.  After eight weeks: Swimming should be OK. After 12 weeks: Contact sports should be OK. Side effects to expect After ear correction surgery, it's common to have: a small scar behind each ear slight bruising around the ears soreness, numbness or tingling in the ears These symptoms should fade over time. What could go wrong Ear correction surgery can occasionally result in: inflammation of the ear cartilage a blood clot forming in the skin of the ear stiff ears \u2013 it can take several months for them to become flexible again the ears no longer being symmetrical the surgery not being successful and the ears starting to protrude again Any type of operation also carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding infection where the cut was made an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are and how they would be treated if they occurred. What to do if you have problems  Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong, and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms. The surgeon who treated you is best placed to deal with any complications. If you've had ear correction surgery and you're not happy with the results or think the procedure wasn't carried out properly, you should take up the matter with your surgeon through the hospital or clinic where you were treated. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC).

Whether you're considering a less invasive procedure like Botox or full cosmetic surgery like breast implants, it's a good idea to do your research. You can start by looking up the procedure in the list of information leaflets on this page, or browsing the menu tabs. All cosmetic procedures carry some level of risk. Cosmetic surgery has greater risks than non-surgical procedures. It's important you choose a practitioner or surgeon who is competent to perform the procedure and has the appropriate insurance. Also, make sure you weigh up the costs, as it's unusual for cosmetic surgery to be available on the NHS. You should factor in any additional costs for aftercare and future surgery, and correcting anything that goes wrong. If you're sure you want to go ahead with surgery, you'll need to choose a surgeon and hospital for your procedure and follow the steps from there. Why has this guide been produced? In recent years there has been a sharp rise in the number of men and women opting for cosmetic surgery and less invasive procedures such as Botox and fillers. Worryingly, this comes at a time when an independent review in 2013 (PDF, 1.38Mb) highlighted serious concerns about the cosmetic procedures industry.  The review proposed much tighter and rigorous regulation for non-surgical cosmetic procedures, and made a number of other recommendations to ensure patient safety.  It also stressed the importance of having accurate information and advice available for patients. That's why this NHS Choices guide to cosmetic procedures has been created. This guide should help you understand the risks and effectiveness of different cosmetic procedures, and ultimately help you decide whether cosmetic surgery is right for you.  Making improvements The government welcomed the review (PDF, 1.9Mb) and accepted most of the recommendations to ensure patient safety. The Department of Health has been working with key organisations to implement these recommendations. Improvements are now being made. Doctors who carry out cosmetic procedures anywhere in the UK have been issued with new guidance by the General Medical Council (GMC) to make sure they provide the best possible care for patients. The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) has also developed professional standards for all surgeons who perform cosmetic surgery. And the RCS will soon be introducing a new cosmetic surgery certification system. This means you will be able to find a surgeon who meets RCS standards for the procedure you are interested in, if you're sure you want to go ahead.

It is usually carried out within the first three months of birth because this is when it is most likely to be effective. Ear splinting is only carried out in infants under six months old. After six months, the cartilage in the ear becomes too hard to be remodelled with splints and surgery is the only treatment option. Information on ear correction surgery, or otoplasty, is provided elsewhere (read about ear correction surgery). What does splinting involve? Ear splints are available in some GP surgeries.  It is a simple and painless procedure. Splinting involves resetting the soft cartilage and using small splints (supports) to keep the ear in the new position.  The splints are kept in place by small strips of tape. The baby's ear will be taped to the side of their head with a larger piece of tape. There may be slight skin irritation from the tape used to hold the splints in place, although this is rare. How long do the splints need to stay on? The length of time splinting is required depends on when treatment begins. The earlier splinting is started, the less time the splints will be needed. For example, if splinting starts when an infant is a few weeks old, it will only be needed for around two weeks. However, if splinting starts when your child is four or five months old, the splints will be needed for a few months. Is splinting effective? If carried out during the first four weeks of life (the neonatal period), ear splinting is usually very effective at correcting a child's protruding ears and preventing the need for surgery later in life.

It can be worrying, but it's usually only caused by a minor infection and will often get better in a few days without treatment. Earache can be a sharp, dull or burning ear pain that comes and goes or is constant. One or both ears may be affected. When to contact your GP It's not always necessary to see your GP if you or your child have earache. The pain will often improve in a few days and there are things you can do to help in the meantime. You should contact your GP or local out-of-hours service if:  you or your child also have other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever), vomiting, a severe sore throat, swelling around the ear, or discharge from the ear there is something stuck in your or your child's ear the earache doesn't improve within a few days What you can do at home You can use over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat the pain. Children under the age of 16 should not take aspirin. Placing a warm flannel against the affected ear may also help relieve the pain. Your pharmacist may be able to recommend over-the-counter eardrops for your earache, but let them know your symptoms and ask for their advice first. Eardrops or olive oil drops should not be used if the eardrum has burst, and they will not help an ear infection. If you or your child has an ear infection, you should avoid getting the affected ear wet. Common causes of earache The information below should not be used to self-diagnose your condition, but it may give you an idea as to what might be causing your earache. It does not include every possible cause, but outlines some of the most common reasons for earache. Ear infections If the cause of earache is an ear infection, there may be a watery or pus-like fluid coming out of the ear. Outer ear infections (infections of the tube connecting the outer ear and eardrum) and middle ear infections (infections of the parts of the ear behind the eardrum) are very common causes of earache. Many ear infections clear up on their own without treatment in a few days or weeks, but in some cases your GP may prescribe eardrops or antibiotics. Read more about treating outer ear infections and treating middle ear infections. Glue ear Glue ear (also known as otitis media with effusion, or OME) is a build-up of fluid deep inside the ear, which commonly causes some temporary hearing loss. The condition tends to be painless, but sometimes the pressure of this fluid can cause earache. Glue ear will often clear up on its own, although this can take a few months. If the problem is particularly persistent, a minor procedure to place small tubes called grommets in the ear may be recommended to help drain the fluid. Read more about treating glue ear. Damage to the ear Earache can sometimes result from injury to the inside of the ear \u2013 for example, by scraping earwax from the ear canal using a cotton bud, or poking a cotton bud too far into your ear, which can puncture the eardrum. The ear canal is very sensitive and can easily become damaged. The ear should heal on its own without treatment, but it can take up to two months for a perforated eardrum to heal. If you have a perforated eardrum, eardrops shouldn't be used. Earwax or an object in the ear A build-up of earwax or an object stuck inside the ear can sometimes cause earache. If there is something in your or your child's ear that seems be causing pain, don't attempt to remove it yourself, as you may only push it further inside and you may damage the eardrum. If you have a build-up of earwax in your ear, your pharmacist will be able to recommend eardrops to soften it so it falls out naturally. In some cases, your GP will need to remove the wax (once softened with eardrops) by flushing the ear with water. This is known as ear irrigation. If there is an object in the ear, your GP may need to refer you or your child to a specialist to have it removed. Throat infections If you find it painful to swallow and you have a sore throat, your earache could be a symptom of a throat infection, such as tonsillitis or quinsy (an abscess on one side of the back of your throat, which can sometimes make it very difficult to swallow even fluids). Some types of tonsillitis will clear up after a few days without the need for antibiotics. But if you have quinsy, you will need to see your GP as soon as possible for treatment. You may have quinsy if your sore throat gets worse very quickly. A problem with your jaw Earache is occasionally caused by a problem with the joint of your jaw bone (where the jaw meets the skull). This is known as temporomandibular joint pain and can be caused by problems such as arthritis or teeth grinding. Jaw pain can often be treated with painkillers, warm or cold compresses, and trying not to clench your jaw and grind your teeth. A dental abscess A dental abscess is a collection of pus that can form in your teeth or gums as a result of a bacterial infection. The main symptom is pain in your affected tooth, which can be intense and throbbing, although the pain can sometimes spread to your ear. If you think you may have a dental abscess, make a dentist appointment as soon as possible. They may need to remove the abscess and drain the pus. Read more about treating dental abscesses.

It usually passes out of the ears harmlessly, but sometimes too much can build up and block the ears. A build-up of earwax is a common problem that can often be treated using eardrops bought from a pharmacy. If pharmacy treatment doesn't work, contact your GP surgery. They may suggest having your ears washed out. If these treatments don't help, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) department for specialised treatment.

Some people regularly get blocked ears because they naturally produce a lot of earwax. Other factors that can increase the risk of too much earwax include: producing naturally hard or dry earwax having narrow or hairy ear canals (the tube between the opening of the ear and the eardrum) being elderly, as earwax becomes drier with age bony growths in the outer part of the ear canal Earwax can also block your ear if you frequently insert objects into your ear canal, such as cotton buds, ear plugs or hearing aids. Symptoms of an earwax build-up A build-up of earwax in your ear can cause: earache hearing loss tinnitus (hearing sounds from inside your body) itchiness in or around the ear vertigo (a spinning sensation) ear infections These problems will usually improve once the excess earwax has been removed. What to do if you think your ear is blocked Don't try to remove a build-up of earwax yourself with your fingers, a cotton bud or any other object. This can damage your ear and push the wax further down. If the earwax is only causing minor problems, you can try buying some eardrops from a pharmacy. These can help soften the earwax so that it falls out naturally. There are several different types of eardrops you can use, including drops containing sodium bicarbonate, olive oil or almond oil. However, eardrops aren't suitable for everyone and some can irritate the skin. For example, eardrops shouldn't be used if you have a perforated eardrum (a hole or tear in your eardrum). Speak to your pharmacist about the most suitable product for you and make sure you read the leaflet that comes with it. When to see your GP Contact your GP surgery if you have particularly troublesome symptoms or eardrops haven't helped after three to five days. Your GP or practice nurse will look inside your ears to check if they're blocked and might carry out some simple hearing tests. They may suggest using eardrops for a bit longer, or they may carry out a minor procedure called ear irrigation to clean out your ear canal. If these treatments aren't suitable or don't help, your GP may refer you to the ENT department of your nearest hospital for more specialised treatments such as microsuction or an aural toilet. Treatments to remove earwax There are several different earwax removal treatments available. The main treatments are: eardrops \u2013 drops used several times a day for a few days to soften the earwax so that it falls out by itself ear irrigation \u2013 a quick and painless procedure where an electric pump is used to push water into your ear and wash the earwax out microsuction \u2013 a quick and painless procedure where a small device is used to suck the earwax out of your ear aural toilet \u2013 where a thin instrument with a small hoop at one end is used to clean your ear and scrape out the earwax Not all these treatments are suitable for everyone. Your pharmacist or doctor can let you know what treatments may work for you and they can tell you about any associated risks or side effects. Preventing an earwax build-up Some people are naturally prone to earwax building up in their ears and may need frequent treatment to remove it when it becomes a problem. It's not clear if there's anything you can do to stop earwax blocking your ears, although some doctors recommend using eardrops regularly to keep your earwax soft. Don't try to scrape out the earwax with your finger or an object inserted into your ear, as this this can make the problem worse. Speak to your doctor for advice if earwax builds up in your ears regularly.

A person with an eating disorder may focus excessively on their weight and shape, leading them to make unhealthy choices about food with damaging results to their health. Types of eating disorders Eating disorders include a range of conditions that can affect someone physically, psychologically and socially. The most common eating disorders are:  anorexia nervosa \u2013 when a person tries to keep their weight as low as possible; for example, by starving themselves or exercising excessively bulimia \u2013 when a person goes through periods of binge eating and is then deliberately sick or uses laxatives (medication to help empty the bowels) to try to control their weight binge eating disorder (BED) \u2013 when a person feels compelled to overeat large amounts of food in a short space of time Some people, particularly those who are young, may be diagnosed with an eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS). This means you have some, but not all, of the typical signs of eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia. What causes eating disorders? Eating disorders are often blamed on the social pressure to be thin, as young people in particular feel they should look a certain way. However, the causes are usually more complex. An eating disorder may be associated with biological, genetic or environmental factors combined with a particular event that triggers the disorder. There may also be other factors that maintain the illness.  Risk factors that can increase the likelihood of a person having an eating disorder include: having a family history of eating disorders, depression or substance misuse being criticised for their eating habits, body shape or weight being overly concerned with being slim, particularly if combined with pressure to be slim from society or for a job \u2013 for example, ballet dancers, models or athletes certain underlying characteristics \u2013 for example, having an obsessive personality, an anxiety disorder, low self-esteem or being a perfectionist particular experiences, such as sexual or emotional abuse or the death of someone special difficult relationships with family members or friends stressful situations \u2013 for example, problems at work, school or university Do I have an eating disorder? Doctors sometimes use a questionnaire to help identify people who may have an eating disorder. The questionnaire asks the following five questions: Do you make yourself sick because you feel uncomfortably full? Do you worry you have lost control over how much you eat? Have you recently lost more than one stone (six kilograms) in a three-month period? Do you believe yourself to be fat when others say you are too thin? Would you say food dominates your life? If you answer \"yes\" to two or more of these questions, you may have an eating disorder. Spotting an eating disorder in others It can often be very difficult to identify that a loved one or friend has developed an eating disorder. Warning signs to look out for include: missing meals complaining of being fat, even though they have a normal weight or are underweight repeatedly weighing themselves and looking at themselves in the mirror making repeated claims that they've already eaten, or they'll shortly be going out to eat somewhere else and avoiding eating at home cooking big or complicated meals for other people, but eating little or none of the food themselves only eating certain low-calorie foods in your presence, such as lettuce or celery feeling uncomfortable or refusing to eat in public places, such as at a restaurant the use of \"pro-anorexia\" websites It can be difficult to know what to do if you're concerned about a friend or family member. It's not unusual for someone with an eating disorder to be secretive and defensive about their eating and their weight, and they may deny being unwell. Read more about approaching and talking to your child about eating disorders and supporting someone with an eating disorder. You can also talk in confidence to an adviser from the eating disorders charity Beat by calling their helpline on 0345 634 1414. They also have a designated youth helpline on 0345 634 7650. Who's affected by eating disorders? A 2015 report commissioned by Beat estimates more than 725,000 people in the UK are affected by an eating disorder. Eating disorders tend to be more common in certain age groups, but they can affect people of any age. Around 1 in 250 women and 1 in 2,000 men will experience anorexia nervosa at some point. The condition usually develops around the age of 16 or 17. Bulimia is around two to three times more common than anorexia nervosa, and 90% of people with the condition are female. It usually develops around the age of 18 or 19. Binge eating affects males and females equally and usually appears later in life, between the ages of 30 and 40. As it's difficult to precisely define binge eating, it's not clear how widespread it is, but it's estimated to affect around 5% of the adult population. Treating eating disorders If an eating disorder isn't treated, it can have a negative impact on someone's job or schoolwork, and can disrupt relationships with family members and friends. The physical effects of an eating disorder can sometimes be fatal. Treatment for eating disorders is available, although recovery can take a long time. It's important that the person affected wants to get better, and the support of family and friends is invaluable. Treatment usually involves monitoring a person's physical health while helping them deal with the underlying psychological causes. This may involve: using self-help manuals and books, possibly under guidance from a therapist or another healthcare professional cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013 therapy that focuses on changing how a person thinks about a situation, which in turn will affect how they act interpersonal psychotherapy \u2013 a talking therapy that focuses on relationship-based issues dietary counselling \u2013 a talking therapy to help a person maintain a healthy diet psychodynamic therapy or cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) \u2013 therapy that focuses on how a person's personality and life experiences influence their current thoughts, feelings, relationships and behaviour family therapy \u2013 therapy involving the family discussing how the eating disorder has affected them and their relationships medication \u2013 for example, a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be used to treat bulimia nervosa or binge eating There's a range of other healthcare services that can help, such as support and self-help groups, and personal and telephone counselling services.

People with anorexia usually do this by restricting the amount of food they eat, making themselves vomit, and exercising excessively.  The condition often develops out of an anxiety about body shape and weight that originates from a fear of being fat or a desire to be thin. Many people with anorexia have a distorted image of themselves, thinking they're fat when they're not. Anorexia most commonly affects girls and women, although it has become more common in boys and men in recent years. On average, the condition first develops at around the age of 16 to 17. Read more about the causes of anorexia. Signs and symptoms of anorexia People with anorexia often go to great lengths to hide their behaviour from family and friends by lying about what they've eaten or pretending to have eaten earlier. Signs someone may have anorexia or another eating disorder include: missing meals, eating very little, or avoiding eating any fatty foods obsessively counting calories in food  leaving the table immediately after eating so they can vomit taking appetite suppressants, laxatives, or diuretics (a type of medication that helps remove fluid from the body) repeatedly weighing themselves or checking their body in the mirror physical problems, such as feeling lightheaded or dizzy, hair loss, or dry skin Anorexia can also be associated with other psychological problems, such as depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, alcohol misuse, and self-harm. Read more about the symptoms of anorexia. Getting help People with anorexia often don't seek help, perhaps because they're afraid or don't recognise they have a problem. Many have hidden their condition for a long time \u2013 sometimes years. The most important first step is for someone with anorexia to realise they need help and want to get better. If you think someone you know has anorexia, try talking to them about your worries and encourage them to seek help. This can be a very difficult conversation because they may be defensive and refuse to accept they have a problem. However, it's important not to criticise or pressure them as this can make things worse. You may want to seek advice from an eating disorder support group such as Beat about the best way to raise the subject. If you think you may have anorexia, try to seek help as soon as possible. You could start by talking to a person you trust, such as a member of your family or a friend, and perhaps ask them to go with you to see your GP. Read more about supporting someone with an eating disorder and advice for parents of a child with an eating disorder. Treating anorexia Before anorexia can be treated, a physical, psychological and social needs assessment will need to be carried out by a GP or an eating disorders specialist. This will help them work out a suitable care plan. In most cases, treatment will involve a combination of psychological therapy and individually tailored advice on eating and nutrition to help gain weight safely. A range of different healthcare professionals will usually be involved in your care, such as GPs, psychiatrists, specialist nurses and dietitians. Most people are able to be treated on an outpatient basis, which means you can go home between appointments. More serious cases are treated in hospital or specialist eating disorder clinics. Read more about diagnosing anorexia and treating anorexia. Outlook It can take several years of treatment to fully recover from anorexia, and relapses are common. For example, a woman may relapse if she tries to lose weight gained during pregnancy. Around half of people with anorexia will continue to have some level of eating problem despite treatment. If anorexia remains unsuccessfully treated for a long time, a number of other serious problems can develop. These can include fragile bones (osteoporosis), infertility, an irregular heartbeat, and other heart problems. Despite being an uncommon condition, anorexia is one of the leading causes of mental health-related deaths. This can be because of the effects of malnutrition or as a result of suicide.

People who binge eat consume very large quantities of food over a short period of time, even when they are not hungry. Binges are often planned in advance and can involve the person buying \"special\" binge foods. In rare cases, people describe themselves as being in a \"dazed state\" during a binge \u2013 particularly binges during the night \u2013 and they are not able to recall what they ate. People who binge eat feel they have no control over their eating. They often binge in private because they feel embarrassed, guilty or disgusted with their behaviour after they have finished eating. Episodes of binge eating sometimes alternate with periods where the person cuts down on the amount of food they eat. This can lead to a vicious cycle that is difficult to break \u2013 where blood sugar levels rise and fall rapidly, and false messages are sent to the brain, which result in cravings for food when your body doesn't need it. Who is affected Anyone can be affected by binge eating. While the condition is slightly more common in women than men, the numbers of men and women affected are more equal than in other eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa. The condition tends to first develop in young adults, although many people do not seek help until they are in their 30s or 40s. It\u2019s estimated that there is around a 1 in 30 to 1 in 50 chance of a person developing binge eating disorder at some point during their life. Getting help Many people will occasionally binge on food \u2013 this doesn't necessarily mean you have a binge eating disorder. However, you should see your GP if you binge regularly and excessively, particularly if the binges are having an effect on your physical and\/or mental health. Your GP can diagnose the condition and may be able to refer you to a specialist, such as a psychiatrist or a psychologist. Your GP will ask you about your eating habits and look for the following signs: you eat much faster than normal during a binge you eat until you feel uncomfortably full you eat a large amount of food when you are not hungry you eat alone or secretly due to being embarrassed about the amount of food you are consuming you have feelings of guilt, shame or disgust after binge eating People who regularly eat this way are likely to have a binge eating disorder. What causes binge eating? It's not clear what causes binge eating, but, like most eating disorders, it's seen as a way of coping with feelings of unhappiness and low self-esteem. Things that may increase your risk of developing problems with binge eating include: low self-esteem and a lack of confidence depression or anxiety feelings of stress, anger, boredom or loneliness dissatisfaction with your body and feeling under pressure to be thin stressful or traumatic events in your past a family history of eating disorders, which may be related to your genes differences in your brain or the level of hormones produced by your brain compared to people who don't binge eat Binge eating can sometimes develop following a strict diet, particularly if you skipped meals, cut certain foods out and didn't eat enough food. These are unhealthy ways to lose weight and may mean you're more likely to binge at another time.   How binge eating is treated Binge eating is treatable and most people eventually get better with appropriate help and support. The main treatments are: self-help programmes \u2013 this may be individually with a book or online course, or as part of a self-help support group guided self-help (self-help supervised by regular contacts with a professional) specialist group intervention individual (one-to-one) psychological therapy \u2013 such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) medication called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) These treatments can help you overcome the psychological issues associated with your binge eating, but they won't usually have a significant impact on your weight. If you are overweight, a healthcare professional may also draw up a weight loss plan to follow during treatment or after any psychological issues have been dealt with. Read more about treating binge eating. Risks of binge eating Binge eating can be associated with serious psychological problems, including depression and anxiety disorders. These feelings can be made worse over time while the person is still binge eating. A common physical effect of binge eating is weight gain, which can lead to obesity. This can put you at risk of a number of related physical health problems, some of which can be life-threatening. These include: high cholesterol and high blood pressure \u2013 which can increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease and stroke diabetes \u2013 a long-term condition that causes your blood sugar level to become too high osteoarthritis \u2013 a condition that causes pain and swelling in the joints some types of cancer \u2013 such as breast cancer and bowel cancer Therefore, it's important to seek help if you think you may have a binge eating problem, because you may need support to help you tackle both your psychological and physical problems. Binge eating and bulimia Although binge eating is similar to another eating disorder called bulimia, the two conditions are different. In people with bulimia, periods of binge eating are followed by attempts to purge (flush out) the food they have eaten \u2013 for example, by making themselves vomit or by taking laxatives. People who binge eat do not purge themselves to control their weight, but may try to limit weight gain by having periods of eating very little between binges.

People who have bulimia try to control their weight by severely restricting the amount of food they eat, then binge eating and purging the food from their body by making themselves vomit or using laxatives.  As with other eating disorders, bulimia nervosa can be associated with: low self-esteem alcohol misuse depression self-harm Learn more about the causes of bulimia nervosa. Binge eating and purging Eating disorders are often associated with an abnormal attitude towards food or body image. Everyone has their own eating habits \u2013 for example, people with a food intolerance need to avoid eating certain foods to stay healthy. However, people suffering from eating disorders tend to use their eating habits and behaviours to cope with emotional distress, and often have an abnormal or unrealistic fear of food, calories and being fat. Because of this fear, people with bulimia nervosa tend to restrict their food intake. This results in periods of excessive eating and loss of control (binge eating), after which they make themselves vomit or use laxatives (purging). They purge themselves because they fear that the binging will cause them to gain weight, and usually feel guilty and ashamed of their behaviour. This is why these behaviours are usually done in secret. Such binge-purge cycles can be triggered by hunger or stress, or are a way to cope with emotional anxiety. Warning signs Signs of bulimia nervosa include an obsessive attitude towards food and eating, an overcritical attitude to their weight and shape, and frequent visits to the bathroom after eating, after which the person might appear flushed and have scarred knuckles (from forcing fingers down the throat to bring on vomiting). Read more about the symptoms and warning signs of bulimia. Bulimia can eventually lead to physical problems associated with poor nutrient intake, excessive vomiting or overuse of laxatives. Read more about these complications of bulimia. Who is affected by bulimia nervosa? As with all eating disorders, women are much more likely to develop bulimia than men. However, bulimia nervosa is becoming increasingly common in boys and men. There are an estimated 1.6 million Britons suffering from some form of eating disorder, and reports estimate that up to 25% may be male. Recent studies suggest that as many as 8% of women have bulimia at some stage in their life. The condition can occur at any age, but mainly affects women aged between 16 and 40 (on average, it starts around the age of 18 or 19). Bulimia nervosa can affect children, but this is extremely rare.  What to do If you have an eating disorder such as bulimia, the first step is to recognise that you have a problem. Then, you need to visit your GP for a medical check-up and advice on how to get treatment. If you think someone you know has bulimia nervosa, talk to them and try to persuade them to see their GP. There are also many support groups and charities you can approach for help, including: beat: beating eating disorders Mental Health Foundation  Anorexia and Bulimia Care MGEDT: Men Get Eating Disorders Too Read about diagnosing bulimia. The first step towards getting better is to recognise the problem and to have a genuine desire to get well. There is strong evidence that self-help books can be effective for many people with bulimia nervosa, especially if they ask a friend or family member to work through it with them. If this is not suitable or is unsuccessful, your GP can refer you for treatment to an eating disorder service, where you may be offered a structured programme of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Some people may also benefit from antidepressant medication (fluoxetine), as this can reduce the urges to binge and vomit. Read more about the treatment of bulimia.

But for people living in countries outside Africa, it continues to be a very low threat. The current outbreak of the Ebola virus mainly affects three countries in West Africa: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Around 27,000 cases and more than 11,000 deaths have been reported by the World Health Organization. This is the largest known outbreak of Ebola. Experts studying the virus believe it is highly unlikely the disease would spread within the UK. To understand why, read Why is the risk low for people in the UK? What are the symptoms, and what should I do if I think I'm infected? A person infected with Ebola virus will typically develop a fever, headache, joint and muscle pain, a sore throat, and intense muscle weakness. These symptoms start suddenly, between two and 21 days after becoming infected. If you feel unwell with the above symptoms within 21 days of coming back from Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone, you should stay at home and immediately telephone 111 or 999 and explain that you have recently visited West Africa. These services will provide advice and arrange for you to be seen in a hospital if necessary so the cause of your illness can be determined. It's really important that medical services are expecting your arrival and calling 111 or 999 will ensure this happens. Read more about the symptoms of Ebola virus disease. How does Ebola spread among people? People can become infected with the Ebola virus if they come into contact with the blood, body fluids or organs of an infected person. Most people are infected by giving care to other infected people, either by directly touching the victim's body or by cleaning up body fluids (stools, urine or vomit) that carry infectious blood. Read more information about how Ebola spreads, and how the outbreak started. Who is at risk, and how can we prevent its spread? Anyone who cares for an infected person or handles their blood or fluid samples is at risk of becoming infected. Hospital workers, laboratory workers and family members are at greatest risk.  Strict infection control procedures and wearing protective clothing minimises this risk \u2013 see preventing the spread of Ebola virus for more information. Simply washing hands with soap and water can destroy the virus. How is Ebola virus disease treated? There's currently no licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola virus disease, although potential new vaccines and drug therapies are being developed and tested. Patients diagnosed with Ebola virus disease are placed in isolation in intensive care, where their blood oxygen levels and blood pressure are maintained at the right level and their body organs supported. Read more information about how Ebola virus disease is treated. Healthcare workers need to avoid contact with the bodily fluids of their infected patients by taking strict precautions. ZMapp is an experimental treatment that can be tried, although it has not yet been tested in humans for safety or effectiveness. The product is a combination of three different antibodies that bind to the protein of the Ebola virus. How is it diagnosed? It's difficult to know if a patient is infected with Ebola virus in the early stages as symptoms such as fever, headache and muscle pain are similar to those of many other diseases. But specialist infection clinicians will make expert judgements on what the most likely diagnosis is, based on the patient\u2019s history. If Ebola is considered a possibility on this basis, then a person would be tested for the disease. Samples of blood or body fluid can be sent to a laboratory to be tested for the presence of Ebola virus, and a diagnosis can be made rapidly. A person suspected of having Ebola would be isolated to minimise contact with other people while they are being tested. It is only if this test is positive that the case is considered to be \u2018confirmed\u2019. If the test is positive, they will be transferred to a hospital high-level isolation unit. If the result is negative, doctors will test for other diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and cholera. Why is the risk low for people in the UK? The likelihood of catching Ebola virus disease is considered very low unless you've travelled to a known infected area and had direct contact with a person with Ebola-like symptoms, or had contact with an infected animal or contaminated objects. Not easily transmitted While it is possible people infected with Ebola could arrive in the UK on a plane, the virus is not as easily transmitted as a respiratory virus such as influenza. Only infectious when symptoms start People infected with Ebola do not become infectious until they have developed symptoms, such as a fever. The disease then progresses very rapidly. This means infectious people do not walk around spreading the disease for a long period. It typically takes five to seven days for symptoms to develop after infection, so there is time to identify people who may have been exposed, put them under surveillance and, if they show symptoms, quarantine them. Effective infection control procedures In past outbreaks, infection control measures have been very effective in containing Ebola within the immediate area. The UK has a robust public health system with the trained staff and facilities necessary to contain cases of Ebola. Training and awareness  Public Health England has advised frontline medical practitioners to be alert to Ebola in those returning from affected areas.  Advice has been issued to the Border Force to identify possible cases of Ebola and there are procedures in place to provide care to the patient and to minimise public health risk to others. Flight crew are trained to respond swiftly to any passengers who develop symptoms during a flight from Africa. They will take measures to reduce transmission on board the plane. But this event is very unlikely, and so far there have been no documented cases of people catching the disease simply by being in the same plane as an Ebola victim.

Sensors attached to the skin are used to detect the electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats. These signals are recorded by a machine and are looked at by a doctor to see if they're unusual. An ECG may be requested by a heart specialist (cardiologist) or any doctor who thinks you might have a problem with your heart, including your GP. The test will usually be carried out at a hospital or clinic by a trained specialist called a cardiac physiologist, although it can sometimes be done at your GP surgery. Despite having a similar name, an ECG isn't the same as an echocardiogram, which is a scan of the heart. When an ECG is used An ECG is often used alongside other tests to help diagnose and monitor conditions affecting the heart. It can be used to investigate symptoms of a possible heart problem, such as chest pain, suddenly noticeable heartbeats (palpitations), dizziness and shortness of breath. An ECG can help detect: arrhythmias \u2013 where the heart beats too slowly, too quickly, or irregularly coronary heart disease \u2013 where the heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances heart attacks \u2013 where the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked cardiomyopathy \u2013 where the heart walls become thickened or enlarged A series of ECGs can also be taken over time to monitor a person already diagnosed with a heart condition or taking medication known to potentially affect the heart. How an ECG is carried out There are several different ways an ECG can be carried out. Generally, the test involves attaching a number of small, sticky sensors called electrodes to your arms, legs and chest. These are connected by wires to an ECG recording machine. You don't need to do anything special to prepare for the test. You can eat and drink as normal beforehand. Before the electrodes are attached, you'll usually need to remove your upper clothing, and sometimes your chest may need to be shaved or cleaned. Once the electrodes are in place, you may be offered a hospital gown to cover yourself. The test itself will normally only last a few minutes, and you can usually go home soon afterwards or return to the ward if you're already staying in hospital. Types of ECG There are three main types of ECG: a resting ECG \u2013 carried out while you're lying down in a comfortable position a stress or exercise ECG \u2013 carried out while you're using an exercise bike or treadmill an ambulatory ECG \u2013 the electrodes are connected to a small portable machine worn at your waist so your heart can be monitored at home for one or more days The type of ECG recommended for you will depend on your symptoms and the heart problem suspected. For example, an exercise ECG may be recommended if your symptoms are triggered by physical activity, whereas an ambulatory ECG may be more suitable if your symptoms are unpredictable and occur in random, short episodes. Getting your results An ECG recording machine will usually show your heart rhythm and electrical activity as a graph displayed electronically or printed on to paper. For an ambulatory ECG, the ECG machine will store the information about your heart electronically, which can be accessed by a doctor when the test is complete. It's not always possible for you to be given the results of your ECG immediately, as the recordings will have to be looked at by a specialist doctor to determine whether there are signs of a possible problem. Other tests may also need to be carried out before it's possible to tell you whether there's a problem. You may need to visit the hospital, clinic or your GP a few days later to discuss your results with a doctor. Are there any risks or side effects? An ECG is a quick, safe and painless test. No electricity is put into your body while it's carried out. There may be some slight discomfort when the electrodes are removed from your skin \u2013 similar to removing a sticking plaster \u2013 and some people may develop a mild rash where the electrodes were attached. There's a possibility the stress placed on your heart during an exercise ECG could cause you to experience problems such as chest pain, an irregular heartbeat, or even a heart attack in some cases, but you'll be monitored carefully during the test and it can be stopped if you start to feel unwell.

It's a type of ultrasound scan, which means a small probe is used to send out high-frequency sound waves that create echoes when they bounce off different parts of the body. These echoes are picked up by the probe and turned into a moving image that's displayed on a monitor while the scan is carried out. An echocardiogram may be requested by a heart specialist (cardiologist) or any doctor who thinks you might have a problem with your heart, including your GP. The test will usually be carried out at a hospital or clinic by a cardiologist or a trained specialist called a cardiac physiologist. Although it has a similar name, an echocardiogram isn't the same as an electrocardiogram (ECG), which is a test used to check your heart's rhythm and electrical activity. When an echocardiogram is used An echocardiogram can help diagnose and monitor certain heart conditions by checking the structure of the heart and surrounding blood vessels, analysing how blood flows through them, and assessing the pumping chambers of the heart. An echocardiogram can help detect: damage from a heart attack \u2013 where the supply of blood to the heart was suddenly blocked heart failure \u2013 where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure congenital heart disease \u2013 birth defects that affect the normal workings of the heart problems with the heart valves \u2013 problems affecting the valves that control the flow of blood within the heart cardiomyopathy \u2013 where the heart walls become thickened or enlarged endocarditis \u2013 an infection of the heart valves An echocardiogram can also help your doctors decide on the best treatment for these conditions. How an echocardiogram is carried out There are several different ways an echocardiogram can be carried out, but most people will have what's known as a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). This procedure is outlined below. You won't usually need to do anything to prepare for the test, unless you're having a transoesophageal echocardiogram. Transthoracic echocardiogram For a TTE, you'll be asked to remove any clothing covering your upper half before lying down on a bed. You may be offered a hospital gown to cover yourself during the test. When you're lying down, several small sticky sensors called electrodes will be attached to your chest. These will be connected to a machine that monitors your heart rhythm during the test. A lubricating gel will be applied to your chest or directly to the ultrasound probe. You'll be asked to lie on your left side and the probe will be moved across your chest. The probe is attached by a cable to a nearby machine that will display and record the images produced. You won't hear the sound waves produced by the probe, but you may hear a swishing noise during the scan. This is normal and is just the sound of the bloodflow through your heart being picked up by the probe. The whole procedure will usually take between 15 and 60 minutes, and you'll normally be able to go home shortly afterwards. Other types of echocardiogram There are also several other types of echocardiogram that can be carried out. These include: a transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) \u2013 where a small probe is passed down the throat into your gullet and stomach (your throat will be numbed with local anaesthetic spray and you'll be given a sedative to help you relax); you may need to avoid eating for several hours before this test a stress echocardiogram \u2013 an echocardiogram carried out during or just after a period of exercise on a treadmill or exercise bike, or after being given an injection of a medication that makes your heart work harder a contrast echocardiogram \u2013 where a harmless substance called a contrast agent is injected into your bloodstream before an echocardiogram is carried out; this substance shows up clearly on the scan and can help create a better image of your heart The type of echocardiogram you will have depends on the heart condition being assessed and how detailed the images need to be. For example, a stress echocardiogram may be recommended if your heart problem is triggered by physical activity, while the more detailed images produced by a TOE may be more useful in helping plan heart surgery. Getting your results In some cases, it may be possible for the person carrying out the scan to discuss the results with you soon after it's finished. However, the images from the scan will usually need to be analysed before the results are sent to the doctor who requested the test. Your doctor will then discuss the results with you during your next appointment. Are there any risks or side effects? A standard echocardiogram is a simple, painless and safe procedure. There are no side effects from the scan, although the lubricating gel may feel cold and you may experience some minor discomfort when the electrodes are removed from your skin at the end of the test. Unlike some other tests and scans, such as X-rays and computerised tomography (CT) scans, no radiation is used during an echocardiogram. However, there are some risks associated with the less common types of echocardiogram. You may find the TOE procedure uncomfortable and your throat may feel sore for a few hours afterwards. You won't be able to drive for 24 hours after the test as you may still feel drowsy from the sedative. There's also a small chance of the probe damaging your throat. During a stress echocardiogram, you may feel sick and dizzy and you may experience some chest pain. There's also a small chance of the procedure triggering an irregular heartbeat or heart attack, but you'll be monitored carefully during the test and it will be stopped if there are signs of any problems. Some people have a reaction to the contrast agent used during a contrast echocardiogram. This will often only cause mild symptoms such as itching, but in rare cases a serious allergic reaction can occur.

The fallopian tubes are the tubes connecting the ovaries to the womb. If an egg gets stuck in them, it won't develop into a baby and your health may be at risk if the pregnancy continues. Unfortunately, it's not possible to save the pregnancy. It usually has to be removed using medicine or an operation. In the UK, around 1 in every 80-90 pregnancies is ectopic. This is around 12,000 pregnancies a year. This page covers: Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy When to get medical advice When to get emergency help How an ectopic pregnancy is treated Help and support after an ectopic pregnancy Trying for another baby What can cause an ectopic pregnancy? Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy An ectopic pregnancy doesn't always cause symptoms and may only be detected during a routine pregnancy scan. If you do have symptoms, they tend to develop between the 4th and 12th week of pregnancy. Symptoms can include a combination of: a missed period and other signs of pregnancy  tummy pain low down on one side vaginal bleeding or a brown watery discharge pain in the tip of your shoulder discomfort when peeing or pooing However, these symptoms aren't necessarily a sign of a serious problem. They can sometimes be caused by other problems, such as a stomach bug. Read more about the symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy. When to get medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 if you have a combination of any of the above symptoms and you might be pregnant \u2013 even if you haven't had a positive pregnancy test. An ectopic pregnancy can be serious, so it's important to get advice right away. Your GP will ask about your symptoms and you'll usually need to do a pregnancy test to determine if you could have an ectopic pregnancy. You may be referred to a specialist early pregnancy clinic for further assessment, where an ultrasound scan and blood tests may be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. Read more about ectopic pregnancy tests. When to get emergency help Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately if you experience a combination of: a sharp, sudden and intense pain in your tummy feeling very dizzy or fainting feeling sick looking very pale These symptoms could mean that your fallopian tube has split open (ruptured). This is very serious and surgery to repair the fallopian tube needs to be carried out as soon as possible. A rupture can be life-threatening, but fortunately they're uncommon and treatable, if dealt with quickly. Deaths from ruptures are extremely rare in the UK. How an ectopic pregnancy is treated There are three main treatments for an ectopic pregnancy: expectant management \u2013 you're carefully monitored and one of the treatments below is used if the fertilised egg doesn't dissolve by itself medication \u2013 an injection of a powerful medicine called methotrexate is used to stop the pregnancy growing surgery \u2013 keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) performed under general anaesthetic is used to remove the fertilised egg, usually along with the affected fallopian tube You'll be told about the benefits and risks of each option. In many cases, a particular treatment will be recommended based on your symptoms and the results of the tests you have. Some treatments may reduce your chances of being able to conceive naturally in the future, although most women will still be able to get pregnant (see below). Talk to your doctor about this. Read more about treating an ectopic pregnancy. Help and support after an ectopic pregnancy Losing a pregnancy can be devastating and many women feel the same sense of grief as if they had lost a family member or partner. It's not uncommon for these feelings to last several months, although they usually improve with time. Make sure you give yourself and your partner time to grieve. If you or your partner are struggling to come to terms with your loss, you may benefit from professional support or counselling. Speak to your GP about this. Support groups for people who have been affected by loss of a pregnancy can also help. These include: The Ectopic Pregnancy Trust The Ectopic Pregnancy Foundation The Miscarriage Association Cruse Bereavement Care Read more about dealing with loss and find bereavement support services in your area. Trying for another baby You may want to try for another baby when you and your partner feel physically and emotionally ready. You'll probably be advised to wait until you've had at least two periods after treatment before trying again, to allow yourself to recover. If you were treated with methotrexate, it's usually recommended that you wait at least three months, because the medicine could harm your baby if you become pregnant during this time. Most women who have had an ectopic pregnancy will be able to get pregnant again, even if they've had a fallopian tube removed. Overall, 65% of women achieve a successful pregnancy within 18 months of an ectopic pregnancy. Occasionally, it may be necessary to use fertility treatment such as IVF. The chances of having another ectopic pregnancy are higher if you've had one before, but the risk is still small (around 10%). If you do become pregnant again, it's a good idea to let your GP know as soon as possible, so early scans can be carried out to check everything's OK. What can cause an ectopic pregnancy? In many cases, it's not clear why a woman has an ectopic pregnancy. Sometimes it happens when there's a problem with the fallopian tubes, such as them being narrow or blocked. The following are all associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy: pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) \u2013 inflammation of the female reproductive system, usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) previous ectopic pregnancy \u2013 the risk of having another ectopic pregnancy is around 10% previous surgery on your fallopian tubes \u2013 such as an unsuccessful female sterilisation procedure fertility treatment, such as IVF \u2013 taking medication to stimulate ovulation (the release of an egg) can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy becoming pregnant while using an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) for contraception \u2013 it's rare to get pregnant while using these, but if you do you're more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy smoking increasing age \u2013 the risk is highest for pregnant women who are aged 35-40 You can't always prevent an ectopic pregnancy, but you can reduce your risk by using a condom when not trying for a baby, to protect yourself from STIs, and by stopping smoking.  Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 03\/02\/2016 Next review due: 03\/02\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's not usually serious, but can be uncomfortable. Ectropion mainly affects the lower eyelid and can occur in one or both eyes. The drooping eyelid can disrupt the drainage of tears, which can make the eyes: sore, red and irritated water excessively feel very dry and gritty more vulnerable to bacterial infections, such as conjunctivitis In severe cases that aren't treated, it's possible to develop a corneal ulcer (a sore on the eye's surface) that could affect your vision. However, this is rare. Ectropion is different to entropion, which is where the eyelid turns inwards, towards the eye. When to seek medical advice Visit your GP if you think you have ectropion. They'll be able to diagnose the problem by examining your eye and can refer you to an eye specialist called an ophthalmologist for further assessment and treatment, if necessary. Contact your GP or NHS 111 immediately, or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if your eye is very red and painful, or you have other symptoms, such as reduced vision or sensitivity to light. This could be a sign of a more serious problem that requires urgent treatment. What causes ectropion? Most cases of ectropion are associated with ageing. They usually occur as the tissues and muscles of the eyelids become weaker as you get older. Less common causes of ectropion include: a problem with the nerves that control the eyelid \u2013 this is often seen in a type of facial paralysis called Bell\u2019s palsy a lump, cyst or tumour on the eyelid  damage to the skin around the eyelid as a result of an injury, a burn, a skin condition such as contact dermatitis, or previous surgery In rare cases, ectropion can be present from birth, if the muscles under the eyelid don't develop properly. Treating ectropion Treatment for ectropion depends on its severity and the underlying cause. Mild cases may not need any treatment. If it's only causing minor problems, your GP or eye specialist can advise you about ways to relieve your symptoms and look after your eyes at home. In more severe cases, an operation to correct the problem will probably be recommended. Looking after your eyes Your doctor may recommend using eye drops during the day and eye ointment at night to reduce irritation and keep your eye lubricated. Try not to wipe your eyes excessively, as this can pull on the eyelid and make the problem worse. If you need to wipe your eyes, it's best to do this gently and wipe upwards and inwards (towards your nose). If an operation is recommended, you may be advised to tape your eyelids closed at night with special skin tape as a temporary measure, to help protect your eyes while you wait to have surgery. Surgery Surgery for ectropion is a relatively minor procedure that takes up to 45 minutes and is usually carried out under local anaesthetic. It's normally performed on an outpatient basis, which means you won't need to stay in hospital overnight. Various different techniques can be used, depending on how severe your ectropion is and the underlying cause. Following surgery, a pad will be placed over your eye to protect it. This will need to remain in place for about a day. A course of antibiotic and steroid drops or ointment will usually be prescribed to help prevent infection and reduce inflammation.  You'll have a follow-up appointment a week or two after your operation. This is to check on the position of your eyelid and sometimes to remove any stitches.

Your GP or specialist can recommend suitable treatments. What causes discoid eczema?

It is also known as venous eczema, gravitational eczema and stasis eczema. Signs and symptoms Like all types of eczema, the affected skin becomes: itchy red and swollen dry and flaky  scaly or crusty There may be periods when these symptoms improve and periods when they become more severe. Your legs may become swollen, especially towards the end of the day or after long periods of standing. Varicose veins (swollen and enlarged veins) are often visible on the legs. Some people also have other symptoms, such as: brown discolouration of the skin red, tender and tight skin that can eventually become hardened (lipodermatosclerosis) small, white scars (atrophie blanche) pain eczema affecting other parts of the body Left untreated, leg ulcers can develop. These are long-lasting wounds that form where the skin has become damaged. When to seek medical advice See your GP if you have symptoms of varicose eczema. They will often be able to make a diagnosis simply by looking at the skin. Read more about diagnosing varicose eczema. What causes varicose eczema?  Varicose eczema is caused by increased pressure in the leg veins. When the small valves in the veins stop working properly, it's difficult for blood to be pushed against gravity and it can leak backwards. This increases the pressure in the veins, which can cause fluid to leak into the surrounding tissue. It is thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of the immune system reacting to this fluid. Varicose eczema is more common in people with varicose veins, as these are also often a sign that the leg veins aren\u2019t working properly. Read more about the causes of varicose eczema. How varicose eczema is treated Varicose eczema tends to be a long-term problem. However, treatments are available to help keep it under control. For most people, treatment involves a combination of: self-help measures \u2013 including ways to improve your circulation, such as keeping active and frequently raising your legs emollients \u2013 moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry) topical corticosteroids \u2013 ointments and creams applied to the skin to help treat the eczema and relieve symptoms compression stockings \u2013 specially designed stockings, usually worn every day, that steadily squeeze your legs and help to improve your circulation If these treatments don\u2019t help, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) in case there is another cause for your symptoms or if they are concerned you may also have a type of eczema called contact dermatitis. If you also have varicose veins, you may be referred to a vascular specialist (a doctor or surgeon specialising in conditions affecting the blood vessels) who can talk to you about the treatment options for varicose veins. Read more about treating varicose eczema. Other types of eczema Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin. Other types of eczema include: atopic eczema (also called atopic dermatitis) \u2013 the most common type of eczema contact dermatitis \u2013 a type of eczema that occurs when the body comes into contact with a particular substance discoid eczema \u2013 a type of eczema that occurs in circular or oval patches on the skin Page last reviewed: 20\/10\/2014 Next review due: 20\/10\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Each cell normally contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, which carry the genes you inherit from your parents, but a baby with Edwards' syndrome has three copies of chromosome number 18, instead of two. This disrupts the baby's normal development and, in many cases, causes them to be miscarried or stillborn. Babies with Edwards' syndrome will have grown slowly in the womb and will have a low birthweight, along with a number of other serious medical problems. Of those that survive to birth, around half will die within two weeks and only around one in every five will live at least three months. Around one in every 12 babies born with Edwards' syndrome survive beyond one year, and they will live with severe physical and mental disabilities. Some children do survive to early adulthood, but this is very rare. Edwards' syndrome affects around one in 3,000 to 6,000 live births. What are the features and symptoms? Babies with Edwards' syndrome can have a wide range of different problems. Physical signs of Edwards' syndrome include: a small, abnormally shaped head a small jaw and mouth long fingers that overlap, with underdeveloped thumbs and clenched fists low-set ears smooth \"rocker bottom\" feet (with a rounded base)  a cleft lip and palate (a gap or split in the upper lip and\/or the roof of the mouth) an exomphalos (where the intestines are held in a sac outside the tummy) Babies with Edwards' syndrome also typically have: heart and kidney problems feeding problems \u2013 leading to poor growth breathing problems hernias in the wall of their stomach (where internal tissues push through a weakness in the muscle wall) bone abnormalities \u2013 such as a curved spine frequent infections of the lungs and urinary system a severe learning disability How does Edwards' syndrome happen? Edwards' syndrome is rarely inherited and the condition is not caused by anything the parents have done. The development of three copies of chromosome 18 usually happens randomly during the formation of eggs and sperm. There is an error in the division of cells, and the extra chromosome is either in the egg cell produced by the mother or in the sperm cell produced by the father. As this happens randomly, it's extremely unlikely for parents to have more than one pregnancy affected by Edwards' syndrome. The chance of having a baby with Edwards' syndrome increases with the mother's age. Types of Edwards' syndrome There are two main types of Edwards' syndrome. Full form Approximately 94% of babies with Edwards' syndrome will have the full form, where every cell in their body has three copies of chromosome 18, instead of two. Most babies with this form will die before infancy. Mosaic trisomy 18 About 5% of babies with Edwards' syndrome will have the extra copy of chromosome 18 in only some of their body cells. This less severe form of the disease is known as mosaic trisomy 18. The severity of mosaic trisomy 18 depends on the type and number of cells that have the extra chromosome. Some babies may only be mildly affected, while some can be severely disabled. Around seven in every 10 babies born with mosaic trisomy will live for at least a year and, in rare cases, babies with the condition may survive into early adulthood. Testing for Edwards' syndrome during pregnancy Pregnant women are offered screening for Edwards\u2019 syndrome between 10 and 14 weeks of pregnancy to assess the chances of their baby having the condition. The screening test, known as the combined test, comprises a blood test plus a nuchal translucency ultrasound scan (nuchal translucency is a collection of fluid at the back of the baby's neck). This test also screens for Down\u2019s syndrome and Patau\u2019s syndrome. Read more about screening for Edwards\u2019 syndrome at 10-14 weeks. Later in pregnancy, usually when you are 18 to 21 weeks pregnant, you will also be offered a scan that looks for physical abnormalities and 11 rare conditions, including Edwards\u2019 syndrome. Read more about the mid-pregnancy scan. If the screening tests show that you have a higher risk of having a baby with Edwards' syndrome, you will be offered diagnostic tests to find out for certain if your baby has the condition. The diagnosis can be confirmed by carrying out chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. These are invasive tests performed during pregnancy to remove a sample of tissue or fluid so it can be tested for the presence of the extra copy of chromosome 18. A newer test has also been developed that can be performed by taking a sample of blood from the mother and testing the baby\u2019s DNA that is found within it. This is known as \"non-invasive prenatal diagnosis\" and is only available privately. Read more about screening tests in pregnancy. Is there any treatment? There is no cure for Edwards' syndrome and the symptoms can be very difficult to manage. You are likely to need help from a wide range of health professionals. Treatment will focus on immediately life-threatening issues, such as infections and heart problems. Your child may also need to be fed through a feeding tube, if feeding is a problem. If limb abnormalities affect your child's movements as they get older, they may benefit from supportive treatment, such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Depending on your child's specific problems, they may need specialist care in hospital or a hospice, or you may be able to look after them at home with appropriate support. Information about your child If your child has Edwards' syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Advice for carers Caring for a child with Edwards' syndrome is mentally and physically challenging. Most carers will need social and psychological support. The NHS Choices Care and support site provides lots of advice on how you can take time to look after yourself, including: keeping fit and healthy  getting a break from caring  getting legal support and advocacy  taking care of your wellbeing You can also visit the SOFT UK website for support and more information on Edwards' syndrome, and to contact other families affected by the condition.

During the test, small sensors are attached to the scalp to pick up the electrical signals produced when brain cells send messages to each other. These signals are recorded by a machine and are looked at by a doctor later to see if they're unusual. The EEG procedure is usually carried out by a highly trained specialist called a clinical neurophysiologist during a short visit to hospital. When an EEG is used An EEG can be used to help diagnose and monitor a number of conditions affecting the brain. It may help identify the cause of certain symptoms \u2013 such as seizures (fits) or memory problems \u2013 or find out more about a condition you've already been diagnosed with. The main use of an EEG is to detect and investigate epilepsy, a condition that causes repeated seizures. An EEG will help your doctor identify the type of epilepsy you have, what may be triggering your seizures, and how best to treat you. Less often, an EEG may be used to investigate other problems, such as dementia, head injuries, brain tumours, encephalitis (brain inflammation) and sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnoea. Preparing for an EEG Your appointment letter will mention anything you need to do to prepare for the test. Unless told otherwise, you can usually eat and drink beforehand and continue to take all your normal medication. To help the sensors stick to your scalp more easily, you should make sure your hair is clean and dry before arriving for your appointment and avoid using products such as hair gel and wax. You might want to bring a hairbrush or comb with you as your hair may be a bit messy when the test is finished. Some people bring a hat to cover their hair until they can wash it at home afterwards. How an EEG is carried out There are several different ways an EEG recording can be taken. The clinical neurophysiologist will explain the procedure to you and can answer any questions you have. You'll also be asked whether you give permission (consent) for the various parts of the test to be carried out. Before the test starts, your scalp will be cleaned and about 20 small sensors called electrodes will be attached using a special glue or paste. These are connected by wires to an EEG recording machine. Routine EEG recordings usually take 20 to 40 minutes, although a typical appointment will last about an hour, including some preparation time at the beginning and some time at the end. Other types of EEG recording may take longer. Types of EEG The main types of EEG are explained below. Routine EEG A routine EEG recording lasts for about 20 to 40 minutes. During the test, you'll be asked to rest quietly and open or close your eyes from time to time. In most cases, you'll also be asked to breathe in and out deeply (known as hyperventilation) for a few minutes. At the end of the procedure a flashing light may be placed nearby to see if this affects your brain activity. Sleep EEG or sleep-deprived EEG A sleep EEG is carried out while you're asleep. It may be used if a routine EEG doesn't give enough information, or to test for sleep disorders. In some cases, you may be asked to stay awake the night before the test to help ensure you can sleep while it's carried out. This is called a sleep-deprived EEG. Ambulatory EEG An ambulatory EEG is where brain activity is recorded throughout the day and night over a period of one or more days. The electrodes will be attached to a small portable EEG recorder that can be clipped on to your clothing. You can continue with most of your normal daily activities while the recording is being taken, although you'll need to avoid getting the equipment wet. Video telemetry Video telemetry, also known as video EEG, is a special type of EEG where you're filmed while a recording is taken. This can help provide more information about your brain activity. The test is usually carried out over a few days while staying in a purpose-built hospital suite. The EEG signals are transmitted wirelessly to a computer. The video is also recorded by the computer and kept under regular surveillance by trained staff. What happens after an EEG When the test is finished, the electrodes will be removed and your scalp will be cleaned. Your hair will probably still be a bit sticky and messy afterwards, so you may want to wash it when you get home. You can usually go home soon after the test is finished and can return to your normal activities. You might feel tired after the test, particularly if you had a sleep or sleep-deprived EEG, so you may want someone to pick you up from hospital. You won't normally get your results on the same day. The recordings will need to be analysed first and will be sent to the doctor who requested the test. They can discuss the results with you a few days or weeks later. Are there any risks or side effects? The EEG procedure is painless, comfortable and generally very safe. No electricity is put into your body while it's carried out. Apart from having messy hair and possibly feeling a bit tired, you won't normally experience any after effects. However, you may feel lightheaded and notice a tingling in your lips and fingers for a few minutes during the hyperventilation part of the test. Some people develop a mild rash where the electrodes were attached. There's a very small risk you could have a seizure while the test is carried out, but you'll be closely monitored and help will be on hand in case this happens.

The NHS Business Services Authority is continuing to provide the EHIC service as usual, and you can apply for and use your card as before. You can apply for or renew an EHIC using the official EHIC online application form. This is free of charge. Beware of unofficial websites, which may charge if you apply through them. Follow EHIC on Facebook  or Twitter for the latest updates from the NHS Business Services Authority and for answers to your questions. A valid European Health Insurance Card gives you the right to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland.  The EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home. Treatment should be provided on the same basis as it would to a resident of that country, either at a reduced cost or, in many cases, for free. For example, in some countries, patients are expected to directly contribute a percentage towards the cost of their state-provided treatment. This is known as a patient co-payment. If you receive treatment under this type of healthcare system, you are expected to pay the same co-payment charge as a patient from that country.  The EHIC also covers the treatment of pre-existing medical conditions and routine maternity care, provided the reason for your visit is not specifically to give birth or seek treatment. For more information about what is covered in each country, see our country-by-country guide. Download the EHIC smartphone app from the European Commission website so you can easily access the information while you are abroad. The EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. It will not cover any private medical healthcare or costs, such as mountain rescue in ski resorts, being flown back to the UK, or lost or stolen property. It is also not valid on cruises. It is therefore important to have both an EHIC and a valid private travel insurance policy in place before you travel. Some insurers now insist you hold an EHIC, and many will waive the excess if you have one. If you are travelling for the express purpose of obtaining medical treatment, read the section on seeking medical treatment in Europe.   Who can apply for a UK-issued EHIC? Residents of the United Kingdom Entitlement to an EHIC is based on insurability under EU law, and not on a person's nationality. This applies to all EEA countries. The UK operates a residency-based healthcare system, which means that insurability is generally determined by residency and not by the past or present payment of National Insurance contributions or UK taxes. If you are ordinarily resident in the UK and not insured by another EEA country, then you are likely to be considered to be insured by the UK under EU law and, therefore, will be entitled to a UK-issued EHIC. You will need to provide the necessary evidence when applying. There are certain circumstances where you may be entitled to a UK-issued EHIC despite living in another EEA country. Further details can be found in the 'Living in Europe' section below. If you are insured by another EEA country but live in the United Kingdom, you are not entitled to a UK-issued EHIC. You should contact the relevant authority in the country you are insured by and request an EHIC. Important: If your circumstances change, you may lose your entitlement to a UK-issued EHIC. If you then use your EHIC abroad, you may be liable for the full cost of treatment received. You may lose your entitlement to a UK-issued EHIC when you move abroad, take up work abroad, or change your residency status. Families Every family member requires an EHIC. You can make an application for yourself and on behalf of your partner and any dependent children under the age of 16. If you already have an EHIC, you must enter your own details first and apply for any additional cards when prompted. If you are under the age of 16, a parent or guardian will need to apply for you. Boarding school teaching staff can apply on behalf of any children in their care. You will need to give the following information for each person you are making an application for: full name date of birth National Insurance (NI) number or NHS Number (CHI number in Scotland, or Health and Care Number in Northern Ireland) Temporary NI numbers cannot be used to apply for an EHIC. A temporary NI number uses the prefix \"TN\", the person's date of birth, and \"M\" or \"F\" to denote gender \u2013 for example, TN131160M. Your card will normally arrive within seven days if you apply using the official EHIC website. Non-EEA nationals If you or a family member are not an EEA or Swiss national, you will have to provide further evidence that you are eligible. You will need to complete an EHIC application form (PDF, 425kb), attach a copy of your visa or UK residence permit, and post it to: NHS Business Services Authority European Health Insurance Card EHIC applications Bridge House 152 Pilgrim Street Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 6SN Living in Europe If you live in another EEA country or Switzerland, you will be entitled to a UK-issued EHIC if one of the following applies to you:  you receive a UK State Pension or exportable UK benefit and have a UK-issued S1 form (certificate of entitlement) registered in your country of residence you are a worker posted to work in another EEA country or Switzerland by your UK employer, or a frontier worker living in the EEA and working in the UK you are a family member of a posted worker or of someone working in the UK and you are not covered in your own right by the EEA country you reside in you are a student going to another EEA country or Switzerland to study For more detailed information, see the Moving abroad section or phone the EHIC enquiry line on 0300 330 1350.  If you are not eligible for a UK-issued EHIC, you should see if you are eligible for an EHIC in the country you are currently living in.  Residents of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are not eligible for an EHIC. How do I renew an EHIC for myself or family members? The EHIC is valid for up to five years. Check your EHIC is still valid before you travel. You can renew an EHIC up to six months before the expiry date, but any time left on the card will not be added to your new card. Renewing your card is free \u2013 if you are a UK resident, you can renew your EHIC online if none of your personal details have changed. Non- EEA nationals If you or a family member are not an EEA or Swiss national, you will have to provide further evidence that you are eligible. You will need to complete an EHIC application form (PDF, 425kb), attach a copy of your visa or UK residence permit, and post it to: NHS Business Services Authority European Health Insurance Card EHIC applications Bridge House 152 Pilgrim Street Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 6SN Living abroad If you live abroad and you: receive a UK State Pension or exportable UK benefit, you are a posted or frontier worker, or you are living in the EEA and are family member of someone working in the UK, then you need to apply to renew your EHIC by contacting the Overseas Healthcare Team: Overseas Healthcare Team Room MO601 Durham House Washington Tyne & Wear Newcastle upon Tyne NE38 7SF Tel: 0191 218 1999 Monday to Friday, 8am to 5pm Families If you need to renew some but not all EHIC cards in your family, enter the details of all family members, including those who still have valid cards. This will ensure the details of all members of the family remain linked. A warning message will be displayed for those whose cards cannot be renewed, and only those cards that have expired or are due to expire will be renewed this time. If you need to amend your personal details, you can only renew your EHIC online if you have your personal identification number (PIN), which is on your EHIC card. The PIN begins with \"UK\" \u2013 for example, UK123456 \u2013 and is found on the same line as your date of birth. It is a good reference number to have at hand, and makes it easier for the EHIC team to find your details on the system. If some of your details have changed since your card was issued but you don't have your PIN, you may not be able to renew your card online.  None of my details have changed You can renew your EHIC card online \u2013 enter all of your details. My name has changed You can only renew online if you have a PIN. If you don't have a PIN, contact the application line on 0300 330 1350 to renew your card. My address has changed If none of your other details have changed or you previously informed the EHIC team of your change of address, you can renew your card online. Enter your new address in the address field. Your renewed card(s) will be sent to this address. If you are unsure whether you have informed the EHIC team of any changes or there have been any other changes to your details, contact the enquiry line on 0300 330 1350. Alternatively, you can email nhsbsa.ehicenquiries@nhsbsa.nhs.uk or write to: EHIC Enquiries PO Box 1114 Newcastle upon Tyne NE99 2TL You will have to provide your full name, UK address, date of birth and your PIN, if you know it.  What is and isn't covered by the EHIC? Each country's health system is different and might not include all the things you would expect to get free of charge from the NHS. This means you may have to make a patient contribution to the cost of your care. For more information, see our county-by-country guide. Not covered The EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. It will not cover any private medical healthcare or costs, such as mountain rescue in ski resorts, being flown back to the UK, or lost or stolen property. This makes it important to have both an EHIC and a valid private travel insurance policy. Some insurers now insist you hold an EHIC, and many will waive the excess if you have one. The EHIC will not cover your medical expenses if you are going abroad specifically to have treatment (including giving birth). Read more about planned treatment abroad. You may not be able to use the card in some parts of the EEA, as state-provided healthcare may not be available. Covered The card provides you with the right to access state-provided healthcare on temporary stays at a reduced cost or, in many cases, for free. This includes treatment of a chronic or pre-existing medical condition that becomes necessary during your visit. It includes routine maternity care (not only because of illness or an accident), as long as you're not going abroad to give birth. However, if the birth happens unexpectedly, the EHIC will cover the cost of all medical treatment for mother and baby linked to the birth. The EHIC covers the provision of oxygen and kidney dialysis, although you will have to arrange and pre-book these treatments before you go on holiday. You can ask your GP or hospital for advice, but make sure you are not booked with a private healthcare provider, as these are not covered by the EHIC. The card also covers routine medical care for people with pre-existing conditions that need monitoring. Am I covered abroad even if I do not have my EHIC with me? If you travel to Europe without your EHIC but then need medical treatment during your visit, you can be issued with a Provisional Replacement Certificate (PRC) to prove your entitlement to the EHIC. You will need to apply for a PRC by calling the Overseas Healthcare Team on +44 (0)191 218 1999, Monday to Friday, 8am to 5pm. It's a good idea to save this number in your phone. Someone else can also do this on your behalf. The PRC will give you the same cover as an EHIC until you return home. If you need to request a PRC outside of the opening hours, you should call the Overseas Healthcare Team to request the PRC as soon as possible for the next working day. You will need to provide your name, address and date of birth. The PRC can be faxed or emailed to the establishment where you are receiving treatment. What happens if my card is lost or stolen? If you need to replace a lost or stolen EHIC, you should call the enquiry line on 0300 330 1350, Monday to Friday, 8am to 11am. A 24\/7 voice automated service is also available. Alternatively, you can email nhsbsa.ehicenquiries@nhsbsa.nhs.uk or write to: EHIC Enquiries PO Box 1114 Newcastle upon Tyne NE99 2TL You will need to provide your full name, UK address, date of birth, and your EHIC personal identification number (PIN), if you know it. If you are in Europe and in need of medical attention but your card was lost or stolen, you will need to apply for a Provisional Replacement Certificate (PRC). Someone else can also do this on your behalf. This will give you the same cover as an EHIC until you return home. The PRC can be faxed or emailed to the establishment where you are receiving treatment. Simply phone the Overseas Healthcare Team on +44 (0)191 218 1999, Monday to Friday, 8am to 5pm. It's a good idea to save this number on your phone. If you need to request a PRC outside opening hours, you should call the Overseas Healthcare Team to request the PRC as soon as possible for the next working day. You will need to provide your name, address and date of birth. Can I claim a refund? Your EHIC provides you with the right to access state-provided healthcare that becomes necessary during your trip, and you will be treated on the same basis as a resident of the country you are visiting. However, in some EEA countries you may be expected to pay your bill upfront and then   claim a refund afterwards. Remember to keep all receipts and any paperwork (make copies if necessary). You or your insurance company may need them if you're applying for a refund. Some countries also ask patients to pay contributions towards the costs of their care, such as for prescription costs, also known as a co-payment. This means that if you are visiting another EEA country where co-payments are required, you will also need to pay for this. This is often non-refundable in that country and since July 1 2014 is also non-refundable in the UK. However, you may still be able to claim reimbursements for any co-payments made before July 1 2014.

Connective tissues provide support in skin, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, internal organs and bones. There are several different types of EDS that may share some symptoms, including: an increased range of joint movement (joint hypermobility) stretchy skin fragile skin that breaks or bruises easily The different types of EDS are caused by faults in certain genes that make connective tissue weaker. Depending on the type of EDS, the faulty gene may have been inherited from one parent, or both parents. Sometimes the faulty gene isn\u2019t inherited, but occurs in the person for the first time. EDS can affect people in different ways. For some the condition is relatively mild, while for others their symptoms can be disabling. Some of the rare severe types can be life-threatening. This pages covers: Main types of EDS Getting medical advice Living with EDS How EDS is inherited Information about you Links to more information Main types of EDS EDS-hypermobile type is the most common type of EDS. Rarer types include classical EDS, vascular EDS and kyphoscoliotic EDS. EDS-hypermobile type EDS-hypermobile type (EDS-HT), also known as hypermobile EDS or EDS type III, is often thought to be the same as or very similar to another condition called joint hypermobility syndrome. People with EDS-HT may have: joint hypermobility loose, unstable joints that dislocate easily joint pain and clicking joints extreme tiredness (fatigue) skin that bruises easily digestive problems, such as heartburn and constipation dizziness and an increased heart rate after standing up problems with internal organs, such as mitral valve prolapse or organ prolapse problems with bladder control (stress incontinence) Currently, there are no tests to confirm whether someone has EDS-HT. The diagnosis is made based on a person's medical history and a physical examination. Classical EDS Classical EDS (previously EDS types I and II) is less common than hypermobile EDS and tends to affect the skin more. People with classical EDS may have: joint hypermobility loose, unstable joints that dislocate easily stretchy skin fragile skin that can split easily \u2013 especially over the forehead, knees, shins and elbows smooth, velvety skin that bruises easily wounds that are slow to heal and leave wide scars hernias and organ prolapse Vascular EDS Vascular EDS (previously EDS type IV) is a rare type of EDS and is often considered to be the most serious. It affects the blood vessels and internal organs, which can cause them to split open and lead to life-threatening bleeding. People with vascular EDS may have: skin that bruises very easily thin skin with visible small blood vessels, particularly on the upper chest and legs  fragile blood vessels that can bulge or tear, resulting in serious internal bleeding a risk of organ problems, such as the bowel tearing, the womb tearing (in late pregnancy) and partial collapse of the lung hypermobile fingers and toes, unusual facial features, (such as a thin nose and lips, large eyes and small earlobes), varicose veins and delayed wound healing Kyphoscoliotic EDS Kyphoscoliotic EDS (previously EDS type VI) is rare. People with kyphoscoliotic EDS may have: curvature of the spine \u2013 this starts in early childhood and often gets worse in the teenage years joint hypermobility loose, unstable joints that dislocate easily weak muscle tone from childhood (hypotonia) \u2013 this may cause a delay in sitting and walking, or difficulty walking if symptoms get worse fragile eyes that can easily be damaged soft, velvety skin that is stretchy, bruises easily and scars Getting medical advice See your GP if you have several troublesome symptoms of EDS. You don't usually need to worry if you only have a few symptoms and they're not causing any problems. Joint hypermobility, for example, is common in healthy people and is unlikely to be caused by EDS if you don't have any other symptoms. Your GP may refer you to a joint specialist (rheumatologist) if you have problems with your joints and they suspect EDS. If there's a possibility you may have one of the rare types of EDS, your GP can refer you to your local genetics service for an assessment. The local genetics specialist will ask about your medical history, family history, assess your symptoms and may carry out a genetic blood test to confirm the diagnosis. If further investigation is needed, your hospital doctor can refer you to a  specialist EDS diagnostic service based in Sheffield and London. Living with EDS There's no specific treatment for EDS, but with support and advice it's possible to manage many of the symptoms. Adapting your activities It's important to be careful about activities that put a lot of strain on your joints or put you at risk of injury. However, it's important not to be overprotective and avoid living an otherwise normal life. Advice will depend on which type of EDS you have and how it affects you. you may be advised to avoid some activities entirely, such as heavy lifting and contact sports for some activities, you may need to wear appropriate protection and be taught how to reduce the strain on your joints lower-risk activities, such as swimming or pilates, may be recommended to help you stay fit and healthy if fatigue is a problem, you can be taught ways to conserve your energy and pace your activities For more tips and advice on joint care, you can read about living with EDS on the Ehlers-Danlos Support UK website. Specialist support People with EDS may also benefit from support from a number of different healthcare professionals. For example: a physiotherapist can teach you exercises to help strengthen your joints, avoid injuries and manage pain an occupational therapist can help you manage daily activities and give advice on equipment that may help you counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be useful if you're struggling to cope with long-term pain for certain types of EDS, regular scans carried out in hospital can detect problems with internal organs genetic counselling can help you learn more about the cause of your condition, how it's inherited, and what the risks of passing it on to your children are (see below) Your GP or consultant can refer you to these services. How EDS is inherited EDS can be inherited, but in some cases it occurs by chance in someone without a family history of the condition. The two main ways that EDS is inherited are: autosomal dominant inheritance (hypermobile, classical and vascular EDS) \u2013 the faulty gene that causes EDS is passed on by one parent and there's a 50% risk of each of their children developing the condition autosomal recessive inheritance (kyphoscoliotic EDS) \u2013 the faulty gene is inherited from both parents and there's a 25% risk of each of their children developing the condition A person with EDS can only pass on the same type of EDS to their children. For example, the children of someone with hypermobile EDS can't inherit vascular EDS. The severity of the condition can vary within the same family. Information about you If you have EDS, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

The three main problems are: premature ejaculation  delayed ejaculation  retrograde ejaculation  These are described in more detail below. If you have a problem with ejaculation, visit your GP, who will discuss the problem with you and may examine you or refer you to a specialist. Premature ejaculation Premature ejaculation is the most common ejaculation problem. It's where the male ejaculates too quickly during sexual intercourse. A study looking at 500 couples from five different countries found the average time taken to ejaculate during intercourse was around five-and-a-half minutes. However, it's up to each couple to decide if they\u2019re happy with the time taken \u2013 there\u2019s no definition of how long sex should last. Occasional episodes of premature ejaculation are common and aren't a cause for concern. However, if you're finding that around half of your attempts at sex result in premature ejaculation, it might help to get treatment. Causes of premature ejaculation  Various psychological and physical factors can cause a man to suddenly experience premature ejaculation. Common physical causes include: prostate problems thyroid problems \u2013 an overactive or underactive thyroid gland   using recreational drugs Common psychological causes include: depression  stress  relationship problems anxiety about sexual performance (particularly at the start of a new relationship, or when a man has had previous problems with sexual performance) It's possible, but less common, for a man to have always experienced premature ejaculation since becoming sexually active. A number of possible causes for this are: Conditioning \u2013 it's possible that early sexual experiences can influence future sexual behaviour. For example, if a teenager conditions himself to ejaculate quickly to avoid being caught masturbating, it may later be difficult to break the habit. A traumatic sexual experience from childhood \u2013 this can range from being caught masturbating to sexual abuse. A strict upbringing and beliefs about sex. Biological reasons \u2013 some men may find their penis is extra sensitive. Treating premature ejaculation There are a number of things you can try yourself before seeking medical help. Measures you can try yourself It can sometimes help to: masturbate an hour or two before having sex use a thick condom to help decrease sensation take a deep breath to briefly shut down the ejaculatory reflex (an automatic reflex of the body during which ejaculation occurs) have sex with your partner on top (to allow them to pull away when you are close to ejaculating) take breaks during sex and think about something boring Couples therapy If you're in a long-term relationship, you may benefit from having couples therapy. During these sessions, the therapist will: encourage couples to explore any relationship issues they have, and give them advice about resolving them show the couple techniques that can help the man \"unlearn\" the habit of premature ejaculation (the two most popular techniques are the \"squeeze\" and \"stop-go\" techniques) In the squeeze technique, the woman masturbates the man, but stops before the point of ejaculation and squeezes the head of his penis for between 10 to 20 seconds. She then lets go and waits for another 30 seconds before resuming masturbation. This process is carried out several times before ejaculation is allowed to occur. The stop-go technique is similar, but the woman doesn\u2019t squeeze the penis. Once the man feels more confident about delaying ejaculation, the couple can begin to have sex, stopping and starting as required. These techniques may sound simple, but they require lots of practice. Antidepressants (SSRIs) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are designed to treat depression, but they also delay ejaculation. SSRIs used for this purpose include: paroxetine sertraline fluoxetine Some men may experience an improvement as soon as treatment begins. However, you'll usually need to take the medication for one to two weeks before you notice the full effects. Side effects of SSRIs are usually mild and should improve after two to three weeks. They include: fatigue feeling sick and being sick diarrhoea  excessive sweating Read more about the side effects of SSRIs. Dapoxetine An SSRI specifically designed to treat premature ejaculation, known as dapoxetine (Priligy), has now been licensed in the UK. Local NHS authorities can choose to prescribe it on the NHS. It acts much faster than the SSRIs mentioned above and can be used \"on demand\". You\u2019ll usually be advised to take it between one and three hours before sex, but not more than once a day. Your response to the treatment will then be reviewed after four weeks (or after six doses), and again every six months. Dapoxetine isn't suitable for all men diagnosed with premature ejaculation. For example, it is not recommended for some men with heart, kidney and liver problems. It can also interact with other medications, such as other antidepressants. Common side effects include: headaches dizziness feeling sick Topical anaesthetics and condoms The use of topical anaesthetics such as lidocaine or prilocaine can help but may be transferred and absorbed to the vagina, causing decreased sensation. Condoms can also be used and are effective, particularly when combined with local anaesthesia. Delayed ejaculation Delayed ejaculation (male orgasmic disorder) is classed as either: experiencing a significant delay before ejaculation being unable to ejaculate at all, even though the man wants to and his erection is normal You may have delayed ejaculation if: you experience a repeated and unwanted delay before ejaculation lasting for 30 to 60 minutes you're unable to ejaculate at least half the times you have sex Causes of delayed ejaculation Like premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation can be caused by psychological and physical factors. Possible psychological causes of delayed ejaculation are similar to those of premature ejaculation \u2013 for example, early sexual trauma, strict upbringing, relationship problems, stress or depression. Physical causes of delayed ejaculation include: diabetes (usually only type 1 diabetes) spinal cord injuries multiple sclerosis surgery to the bladder or prostate gland increasing age Many medicines are known to cause delayed ejaculation, including: antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) medications to treat high blood pressure, such as beta-blockers antipsychotics, used to treat episodes of psychosis  muscle relaxants such as balcofen, which is widely used to treat motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis powerful painkillers, such as methadone (which is also widely used to treat people addicted to heroin) Delayed ejaculation can suddenly start to happen after previously having no problems, or (less commonly) the man may have always experienced it. It can occur in all sexual situations, or only in certain situations. For example, you may be able to ejaculate normally when masturbating, but not during sex. When ejaculation only occurs in certain situations, there's usually a psychological cause. Treating delayed ejaculation Sex therapy Sex therapy is a form of counselling that uses a combination of psychotherapy and structured changes in your sex life. This can help to increase your feeling of enjoyment during sex, and help make ejaculation easier. Some clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) provide a sex therapy service on the NHS. Availability can vary widely depending on where you live. You can also pay privately. Prices per session are around £50 to £80. The College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists website provides information about private sex therapists and how to find a therapist in your local area. The relationship counselling service Relate also offers sex therapy at a number of its centres. You\u2019ll need to pay for each session.  During sex therapy, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to discuss any emotional or psychological issues related to your sexuality and relationship, in a non-judgemental way. Activities may also be recommended for you to try at home while you're having sex with your partner (you should never be asked to take part in any sexual activities during a session with the therapist). These may include: viewing erotic videos and magazines before having sex to increase the feeling of stimulation erotic fantasies and \"sex games\" to make your lovemaking more exciting using lubricating creams, or jellies, to make the physical act of sex more comfortable and relaxing using sexual aids, such as vibrators, to increase pleasure Read more information about what a sex therapist can do. Switching medication There are a number of medications that can be used if it's thought SSRIs are responsible for causing delayed ejaculation. These include: amantadine \u2013 originally designed to treat viral infections buproprion \u2013 usually prescribed to help people quit smoking yohimbine \u2013 originally designed to treat erectile dysfunction These help block some of the chemical effects of SSRIs that may contribute towards delayed ejaculation. Alcohol and drugs Alcohol misuse and drug use can be separate underlying causes of delayed ejaculation, so addressing these problems may help. Read more about getting help with alcohol misuse and drug use. Pseudoephedrine Pseudoephedrine tablets may be tried, but these will need to be prescribed \"off-label\". This means the medicine shows promise in treating delayed ejaculation but it hasn't been licensed for this particular use (pseudoephedrine is normally used as a decongestant).  Retrograde ejaculation Retrograde ejaculation is a rarer type of ejaculation problem. It happens when semen travels backwards into the bladder instead of through the urethra (the tube that urine passes through). The main symptoms of retrograde ejaculation include: producing no semen, or only a small amount, during ejaculation producing cloudy urine (because of the semen in it) when you first go to the toilet after having sex Men with retrograde ejaculation still experience the feeling of an orgasm and the condition doesn't pose a danger to health. However, it can affect the ability to father a child. Causes of retrograde ejaculation Retrograde ejaculation is caused by damage to the nerves or muscles that surround the neck of the bladder (the point where the urethra connects to the bladder). Usually when you ejaculate, semen is pushed out of your urethra. It is prevented from entering your bladder by the muscles around the neck of the bladder, which close tightly at the moment of orgasm. However, damage to the surrounding muscles or nerves can stop the bladder neck closing, causing the semen to move into the bladder rather than up through the urethra. Prostate gland surgery or bladder surgery is the most common cause of retrograde ejaculation. Other causes are diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and a class of medicines known as alpha blockers, which are often used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). Treating retrograde ejaculation Most men do not need treatment for retrograde ejaculation because they are still able to enjoy a healthy sex life and the condition does not have adverse effects on their health. But if treatment is required (usually because of wanting to father a child), there are options to try. For example, pseudoephedrine (commonly used as a decongestant) has proved effective in treating retrograde ejaculation caused by diabetes or surgery. If retrograde ejaculation is caused by using a certain medication, then normal ejaculation will usually return once medication is stopped. Speak to your GP before stopping any prescribed medication. However, if the retrograde ejaculation has been caused by significant muscle or nerve damage, treatment may not be possible. Men who want to have children can have sperm taken from their urine for use in artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). Involve your partner If you are having problems with your sex life and are seeking treatment, it is usually recommended you involve your partner as much as possible. Communicating your concerns can often go a long way to helping to resolve them. And in some cases your partner may also have their own problems that are contributing towards problems with your sex life. For example some women are unable to reach climax during \"normal\" intercourse and require manual or oral stimulation. Read more about why talking about sex is important. Blood in your semen Finding blood in your semen (haematospermia) can be alarming. However, in most cases it's not serious and will pass within a few days. The most likely cause is infection of your urethra (urethritis) or prostate (prostatitis). See your GP or visit your local genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinic if the symptoms persist, because the causes may be more serious. Read more about blood in the semen.

It can also cause an unpleasant crawling or creeping sensation in the feet, calves and thighs. The sensation is often worse in the evening or at night. Occasionally, the arms are affected too. Restless legs syndrome is also associated with involuntary jerking of the legs and arms, known as periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). Some people have the symptoms of restless legs syndrome occasionally, while others have them every day. The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. In severe cases, restless legs syndrome can be very distressing and disrupt a person's daily activities. What causes restless legs syndrome? In the majority of cases, there's no obvious cause of restless legs syndrome. This known as idiopathic or primary restless legs syndrome, and it can run in families. Some neurologists (specialists in treating conditions that affect the nervous system) believe the symptoms of restless legs syndrome may have something to do with how the body handles a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is involved in controlling muscle movement and may be responsible for the involuntary leg movements associated with restless legs syndrome. In some cases, restless legs syndrome is caused by an underlying health condition, such as iron deficiency anaemia or kidney failure. This is known as secondary restless legs syndrome. There's also a link between restless legs syndrome and pregnancy. About 1 in 5 pregnant women will experience symptoms in the last three months of their pregnancy, although it's not clear exactly why this is. In such cases, restless legs syndrome usually disappears after the woman has given birth. Read more about the causes of restless legs syndrome. Treating restless legs syndrome Mild cases of restless legs syndrome that aren't linked to an underlying health condition may not require any treatment, other than making a few lifestyle changes, such as: adopting good sleep habits \u2013 for example, following a regular bedtime ritual, sleeping regular hours, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine late at night quitting smoking if you smoke exercising regularly during the daytime If your symptoms are more severe, you may need medication to regulate the levels of dopamine and iron in your body. If restless legs syndrome is caused by iron deficiency anaemia, iron supplements may be all that's needed to treat the symptoms. Read more about treating restless legs syndrome. Who's affected by restless legs syndrome? As many as 1 in 10 people are affected by restless legs syndrome at some point in their life. Women are twice as likely to develop restless legs syndrome than men. It's also more common in middle age, although the symptoms can develop at any age, including childhood. Outlook The symptoms of restless legs syndrome will usually disappear if it's possible to address an underlying cause.  However, if the cause is unknown, the symptoms can sometimes get worse with time and severely affect the person's life. Restless legs syndrome isn't life threatening, but severe cases can severely disrupt sleep (causing insomnia) and trigger anxiety and depression. The charity Restless Leg Syndrome UK provides information and support for people affected by restless legs syndrome, and may be able to put you in touch with other people in your area affected by the condition.

It can often be managed with rest and over-the-counter painkillers. If your arm has suddenly started hurting but you don't think the cause is serious, try caring for it at home by: holding an ice pack (a pack of frozen peas in a tea towel works well) to your arm for 15-20 minutes every few hours for the first couple of days taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to relieve the pain and any inflammation resting the arm and keeping it raised for as long as possible (try resting it on cushions) to help reduce any swelling and pain See your GP if your arm pain doesn't improve after several days, or if there's increasing redness, swelling or pain. When to get immediate medical help See your GP immediately if: your arm pain is brought on by exercise and relieved with rest; it may be a sign of angina (restricted blood supply to the heart) you think you may have a broken arm (but aren't sure) your arm becomes red, hot and swollen over a period of a few hours, and you start to feel generally unwell and develop a high temperature; you may have an infection   Call 999 for an ambulance if: the pain has come on suddenly and your chest feels like it's being squeezed (you may be having a heart attack or stroke) you have obviously broken your arm (it looks the wrong shape) Read on to get a better idea of what might be wrong with your arm, but don't use this information to diagnose yourself \u2013 always see your GP for a proper diagnosis. Shoulder pain is covered separately. Common causes of arm pain The most common causes of arm pain are: a simple sprain tennis elbow or golfer's elbow bursitis a squashed or trapped nerve angina  repetitive strain injury (RSI) These are discussed below. Simple sprain If you think your pain has been caused by doing more activity than you're used to, you may have just sprained your arm. This means the arm tissues have been stretched, twisted or torn, but aren't permanently damaged. Read about sprains and strains. Avoid exercising the arm and care for it at home using painkillers and an ice pack (see the advice above) until the pain goes away. Tennis elbow or golfer's elbow Tennis elbow and golfer's elbow are conditions that cause pain around the outside or inside of the elbow. They often occur after strenuous overuse of the muscles and tendons near the elbow joint (for example, after playing tennis or golf). The pain caused by tennis elbow or golfer's elbow can last for several weeks or months, but will eventually get better. Bursitis Repetitive movement of the arm can cause a build-up of fluid over the elbow joint, known as olecranon bursitis (the olecranon is the bony tip of the elbow). This results in pain and swelling. Most cases of bursitis can be successfully treated with painkillers at home, but some cases will be complicated by infections and may need antibiotics (this is more common after sustaining a scratch or penetrating injury to the arm). The pain will usually improve within a few weeks, although the swelling may take longer to completely disappear. Squashed or trapped nerve Sometimes, the general \"wear and tear\" that occurs in the joints and bones of the spine as a person gets older can cause the nerves in the spinal cord to become squashed or trapped. This can cause pain that radiates from the neck to the arms, and sometimes also pins and needles. This type of wear and tear is known as spinal arthritis or cervical spondylosis. Arm pain caused by cervical spondylosis varies from person to person, but it's typical to have good days and bad days. In most cases, symptoms can be controlled using over-the-counter medication, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, and exercise.  Read more about treating cervical spondylosis. A trapped nerve can also occur in the arm itself. This can sometimes occur in the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome) or in the elbow (cubital tunnel syndrome). Pain and tingling in your arm and hand that isn't associated with neck pain may be caused by these conditions. Angina Angina is a heart condition caused when the blood supply to the muscles of the heart is restricted. It usually occurs when the arteries supplying the heart become hardened and narrowed. Angina usually causes a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest that can sometimes spread to the left arm, neck, jaw or back. The pain is usually triggered by physical activity or stress and often only lasts for a few minutes. However, sometimes angina may only be felt as pain in the arm. This is why it's important to see your GP as soon as possible if your arm pain comes on after exercise and is relieved with rest. Angina is a serious warning sign that you have an increased risk of more serious conditions, such as a heart attack or stroke. Learn more about the symptoms of angina. Repetitive strain injury Repetitive strain injury may be diagnosed if your arm or elbow pain seems to be caused by a repetitive task and then fades when the task is stopped. It often occurs in people who work with computers or carry out repetitive manual work. Sometimes, the pain is caused by an underlying problem, such as bursitis or tendonitis. Read more about repetitive strain injury. Less common causes of arm pain Less commonly, arm pain may be caused by one of the following conditions or injuries: de Quervain's tenosynovitis \u2013 inflammation of the tendons on the inside of the wrist (read about tendonitis and tenosynovitis) cervical rib \u2013 where you have an extra rib above your normal top rib, which may cause pain, tingling or numbness in the arm inflammation of the nerves in the arm (known as 'brachial and ulnar neuritis') \u2013 this may occur after shingles damage to the nerves connecting the spine and the arm (a 'brachial plexus injury') \u2013 this can be caused by over-stretching the arm or shoulder and most often occurs during contact sports or a motor vehicle accident arthritis of the elbow \u2013 which can cause the elbow joint to become inflamed (swollen, warm and painful) and feel stiff a broken arm, usually caused by a fall onto an outstretched arm Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 18\/09\/2015 Next review due: 18\/09\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Sensors attached to the skin are used to detect the electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats. These signals are recorded by a machine and are looked at by a doctor to see if they're unusual. An ECG may be requested by a heart specialist (cardiologist) or any doctor who thinks you might have a problem with your heart, including your GP. The test will usually be carried out at a hospital or clinic by a trained specialist called a cardiac physiologist, although it can sometimes be done at your GP surgery. Despite having a similar name, an ECG isn't the same as an echocardiogram, which is a scan of the heart. When an ECG is used An ECG is often used alongside other tests to help diagnose and monitor conditions affecting the heart. It can be used to investigate symptoms of a possible heart problem, such as chest pain, suddenly noticeable heartbeats (palpitations), dizziness and shortness of breath. An ECG can help detect: arrhythmias \u2013 where the heart beats too slowly, too quickly, or irregularly coronary heart disease \u2013 where the heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances heart attacks \u2013 where the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked cardiomyopathy \u2013 where the heart walls become thickened or enlarged A series of ECGs can also be taken over time to monitor a person already diagnosed with a heart condition or taking medication known to potentially affect the heart. How an ECG is carried out There are several different ways an ECG can be carried out. Generally, the test involves attaching a number of small, sticky sensors called electrodes to your arms, legs and chest. These are connected by wires to an ECG recording machine. You don't need to do anything special to prepare for the test. You can eat and drink as normal beforehand. Before the electrodes are attached, you'll usually need to remove your upper clothing, and sometimes your chest may need to be shaved or cleaned. Once the electrodes are in place, you may be offered a hospital gown to cover yourself. The test itself will normally only last a few minutes, and you can usually go home soon afterwards or return to the ward if you're already staying in hospital. Types of ECG There are three main types of ECG: a resting ECG \u2013 carried out while you're lying down in a comfortable position a stress or exercise ECG \u2013 carried out while you're using an exercise bike or treadmill an ambulatory ECG \u2013 the electrodes are connected to a small portable machine worn at your waist so your heart can be monitored at home for one or more days The type of ECG recommended for you will depend on your symptoms and the heart problem suspected. For example, an exercise ECG may be recommended if your symptoms are triggered by physical activity, whereas an ambulatory ECG may be more suitable if your symptoms are unpredictable and occur in random, short episodes. Getting your results An ECG recording machine will usually show your heart rhythm and electrical activity as a graph displayed electronically or printed on to paper. For an ambulatory ECG, the ECG machine will store the information about your heart electronically, which can be accessed by a doctor when the test is complete. It's not always possible for you to be given the results of your ECG immediately, as the recordings will have to be looked at by a specialist doctor to determine whether there are signs of a possible problem. Other tests may also need to be carried out before it's possible to tell you whether there's a problem. You may need to visit the hospital, clinic or your GP a few days later to discuss your results with a doctor. Are there any risks or side effects? An ECG is a quick, safe and painless test. No electricity is put into your body while it's carried out. There may be some slight discomfort when the electrodes are removed from your skin \u2013 similar to removing a sticking plaster \u2013 and some people may develop a mild rash where the electrodes were attached. There's a possibility the stress placed on your heart during an exercise ECG could cause you to experience problems such as chest pain, an irregular heartbeat, or even a heart attack in some cases, but you'll be monitored carefully during the test and it can be stopped if you start to feel unwell.

During the test, small sensors are attached to the scalp to pick up the electrical signals produced when brain cells send messages to each other. These signals are recorded by a machine and are looked at by a doctor later to see if they're unusual. The EEG procedure is usually carried out by a highly trained specialist called a clinical neurophysiologist during a short visit to hospital. When an EEG is used An EEG can be used to help diagnose and monitor a number of conditions affecting the brain. It may help identify the cause of certain symptoms \u2013 such as seizures (fits) or memory problems \u2013 or find out more about a condition you've already been diagnosed with. The main use of an EEG is to detect and investigate epilepsy, a condition that causes repeated seizures. An EEG will help your doctor identify the type of epilepsy you have, what may be triggering your seizures, and how best to treat you. Less often, an EEG may be used to investigate other problems, such as dementia, head injuries, brain tumours, encephalitis (brain inflammation) and sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnoea. Preparing for an EEG Your appointment letter will mention anything you need to do to prepare for the test. Unless told otherwise, you can usually eat and drink beforehand and continue to take all your normal medication. To help the sensors stick to your scalp more easily, you should make sure your hair is clean and dry before arriving for your appointment and avoid using products such as hair gel and wax. You might want to bring a hairbrush or comb with you as your hair may be a bit messy when the test is finished. Some people bring a hat to cover their hair until they can wash it at home afterwards. How an EEG is carried out There are several different ways an EEG recording can be taken. The clinical neurophysiologist will explain the procedure to you and can answer any questions you have. You'll also be asked whether you give permission (consent) for the various parts of the test to be carried out. Before the test starts, your scalp will be cleaned and about 20 small sensors called electrodes will be attached using a special glue or paste. These are connected by wires to an EEG recording machine. Routine EEG recordings usually take 20 to 40 minutes, although a typical appointment will last about an hour, including some preparation time at the beginning and some time at the end. Other types of EEG recording may take longer. Types of EEG The main types of EEG are explained below. Routine EEG A routine EEG recording lasts for about 20 to 40 minutes. During the test, you'll be asked to rest quietly and open or close your eyes from time to time. In most cases, you'll also be asked to breathe in and out deeply (known as hyperventilation) for a few minutes. At the end of the procedure a flashing light may be placed nearby to see if this affects your brain activity. Sleep EEG or sleep-deprived EEG A sleep EEG is carried out while you're asleep. It may be used if a routine EEG doesn't give enough information, or to test for sleep disorders. In some cases, you may be asked to stay awake the night before the test to help ensure you can sleep while it's carried out. This is called a sleep-deprived EEG. Ambulatory EEG An ambulatory EEG is where brain activity is recorded throughout the day and night over a period of one or more days. The electrodes will be attached to a small portable EEG recorder that can be clipped on to your clothing. You can continue with most of your normal daily activities while the recording is being taken, although you'll need to avoid getting the equipment wet. Video telemetry Video telemetry, also known as video EEG, is a special type of EEG where you're filmed while a recording is taken. This can help provide more information about your brain activity. The test is usually carried out over a few days while staying in a purpose-built hospital suite. The EEG signals are transmitted wirelessly to a computer. The video is also recorded by the computer and kept under regular surveillance by trained staff. What happens after an EEG When the test is finished, the electrodes will be removed and your scalp will be cleaned. Your hair will probably still be a bit sticky and messy afterwards, so you may want to wash it when you get home. You can usually go home soon after the test is finished and can return to your normal activities. You might feel tired after the test, particularly if you had a sleep or sleep-deprived EEG, so you may want someone to pick you up from hospital. You won't normally get your results on the same day. The recordings will need to be analysed first and will be sent to the doctor who requested the test. They can discuss the results with you a few days or weeks later. Are there any risks or side effects? The EEG procedure is painless, comfortable and generally very safe. No electricity is put into your body while it's carried out. Apart from having messy hair and possibly feeling a bit tired, you won't normally experience any after effects. However, you may feel lightheaded and notice a tingling in your lips and fingers for a few minutes during the hyperventilation part of the test. Some people develop a mild rash where the electrodes were attached. There's a very small risk you could have a seizure while the test is carried out, but you'll be closely monitored and help will be on hand in case this happens.

Electrolytes are salts and minerals, such as sodium, potassium, chloride and bicarbonate, which are found in the blood. They can conduct electrical impulses in the body. The test is sometimes carried out during a routine physical examination, or it may be used as part of a more comprehensive set of tests. For example, your electrolyte level may be checked if you're prescribed certain medications, such as diuretics or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are often used to treat high blood pressure. As well as checking levels of electrolytes in the blood, an electrolyte panel (a group of specific blood tests) can also be used to find out whether there's an acid-base imbalance (a normal arterial blood pH range is 7.35 to 7.45). An electrolyte test can also be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment for an imbalance that affects the functioning of an organ. Treatment for an electrolyte imbalance will depend on which electrolyte is out of balance and by how much. For example, if you have a sodium imbalance you may be advised to lower your salt intake (if sodium is too high) or reduce your fluid intake (if sodium is too low).

To function properly, the body's tissues and organs need oxygen, which is transported around the body in the bloodstream. If the blood supply to a major organ \u2013 such as the brain, heart or lungs \u2013 is blocked, the organ will lose some or all of its function. Two of the most serious conditions caused by an embolism are: stroke \u2013 where the supply of blood to the brain is interrupted or cut off pulmonary embolisms \u2013 when a foreign body blocks the artery transporting blood to the lungs What causes an embolism? A foreign body is any object or substance which shouldn't be in your blood. Foreign bodies that cause embolisms are known as emboli \u2013 a single emboli is called an embolus. Blood clots Blood contains natural clotting agents which help prevent excessive bleeding when you cut yourself. Certain health conditions \u2013 such as obesity, heart disease, cancer or pregnancy \u2013 can cause blood clots to form even where there's no bleeding. A clot can travel in the bloodstream before being deposited in an organ or limb. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot in the deep veins of your leg, is one of the main causes of pulmonary embolisms. Fat A fracture to a long bone, such as a thigh bone, can lead to fat particles within the bone being released into the bloodstream. They can also sometimes develop following severe burns or as a complication of bone surgery. Air Embolisms can also occur if air bubbles or other gases enter the bloodstream. Air embolisms are a particular concern for scuba divers. If a diver swims to the surface too quickly, the change in pressure can cause nitrogen bubbles to develop in their bloodstream. This can cause decompression sickness, which is often referred to as \"the bends\". Read more information about an air embolism. Cholesterol In people with severe atherosclerosis (narrowed arteries due to a build-up of cholesterol), small pieces of cholesterol can sometimes break away from the side of a blood vessel, resulting in an embolism. Amniotic fluid In rare cases, amniotic fluid \u2013 which surrounds and protects a baby inside the womb \u2013 can leak into the mother's blood vessels during labour, causing a blockage. This could lead to breathing problems, a drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness. Increased risk Your risk of an embolism is increased by: being overweight or obese \u2013 having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more being pregnant being 60 years old or over smoking having heart disease being immobile for long periods of time Treating embolisms How an embolism is treated will depend on: what caused the blockage the size of the blockage where in the body the blockage is A surgical procedure called an embolectomy is sometimes carried out to remove an obstruction. During this operation, the surgeon will make a cut in the affected artery and the foreign body causing the blockage will be sucked out in a process known as aspiration. Medication may be used to dissolve embolisms (thrombolysis) caused by blood clots. Anticoagulant medication, such as warfarin, heparin and low-dose aspirin, can help make the blood less sticky and stop further clots forming. Embolisms caused by air bubbles are usually treated in a hyperbaric chamber. The air pressure inside the chamber is higher than the normal air pressure outside, which helps reduce the size of the air bubbles inside the diver's body. Read more about treating air embolisms. Prevention It's not possible to prevent all embolisms, but you can take steps to significantly reduce your risk. These steps include: eating a healthy diet \u2013 low in fat, high in fibre and including whole grains and plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least five portions a day) limiting the amount of salt in your diet to no more than 6g (0.2oz or 1 teaspoon) a day losing weight if you're overweight or obese, using a combination of regular exercise and a calorie-controlled diet stopping smoking, if you smoke exercising for a minimum of 150 minutes a week Page last reviewed: 07\/01\/2015 Next review due: 07\/01\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: Emergency contraception (morning after pill, IUD) Emergency contraception can prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or if your contraceptive method has failed \u2013 for example, a condom has split or you've missed a pill. There are two types:  the emergency contraceptive pill (sometimes called the morning after pill) the IUD (intrauterine device, or coil) At a glance: emergency contraception   The emergency pill    The IUD as emergency contraception   Where to get emergency contraception   Contraception for the future There are two kinds of emergency contraceptive pill. Levonelle has to be taken within 72 hours (three days) of sex, and ellaOne has to be taken within 120 hours (five days) of sex. Both pills work by preventing or delaying ovulation (release of an egg). The IUD can be inserted into your uterus up to five days after unprotected sex, or up to five days after the earliest time you could have ovulated. It may stop an egg from being fertilised or implanting in your womb. Emergency contraception does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). At a glance: facts about emergency contraception Both types of emergency contraception are effective at preventing pregnancy if they are used soon after unprotected sex. Less than 1% of women who use the IUD get pregnant, whereas pregnancies after the emergency contraceptive pill are not as rare. It\u2019s thought that ellaOne is more effective than Levonelle. The sooner you take Levonelle or ellaOne, the more effective it will be. Levonelle or ellaOne can make you feel sick, dizzy or tired, or give you a headache, tender breasts or abdominal pain. Levonelle or ellaOne can make your period earlier or later than usual. If you\u2019re sick (vomit) within two hours of taking Levonelle, or three hours of taking ellaOne, seek medical advice as you will need to take another dose or have an IUD fitted. If you use the IUD as emergency contraception, it can be left in as your regular contraceptive method. If you use the IUD as a regular method of contraception, it can make your periods longer, heavier or more painful. You may feel some discomfort when the IUD is put in \u2013 painkillers can help to relieve this. There are no serious side effects of using emergency contraception. Emergency contraception does not cause an abortion. The emergency pill How the emergency pill works How effective the emergency pill is at preventing pregnancy How it affects your period  Who can use the emergency pill  During breastfeeding If you're already using the pill, patch, vaginal ring or injection Side effects of the emergency pill The emergency pill and other medicines Can I get the emergency pill in advance? How the emergency pill works Levonelle Levonelle contains levonorgestrel, a synthetic version of the natural hormone progesterone. In a woman\u2019s body, progesterone plays a role in ovulation and preparing the uterus for accepting a fertilised egg. It\u2019s not known exactly how Levonelle works, but it\u2019s thought to work primarily by preventing or delaying ovulation. It does not interfere with your regular method of contraception. ellaOne ellaOne contains ulipristal acetate, which stops progesterone working normally. It prevents pregnancy mainly by preventing or delaying ovulation.` Levonelle and ellaOne do not continue to protect you against pregnancy. This means that if you have unprotected sex at any time after taking the emergency pill you can become pregnant. Even if you are starting or continuing another method of hormonal contraception, it may not be effective immediately. You will need to use condoms or avoid sex until the contraception is working effectively. The time it takes for contraception to become effective depends on the emergency contraceptive pill and the method of hormonal contraception being started. Your doctor or nurse will tell you when you can start hormonal contraception and how long you will need to take additional precautions to prevent an unintended pregnancy. Levonelle and ellaOne are not intended to be used as a regular form of contraception. However, you can use emergency contraception more than once in a menstrual cycle if necessary. How effective is the emergency pill at preventing pregnancy? You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services some pharmacies  Find a clinic near you It can be difficult to know how many pregnancies the emergency pill prevents, because there is no way to know for sure how many women would have got pregnant if they did not take it. A study published in 2010 showed that of 1,696 women who received the emergency pill within 72 hours of sex, 37 became pregnant (1,659 did not). Of 203 women who took the emergency pill between 72 and 120 hours after unprotected sex, there were three pregnancies. Find out more about the research on the effectiveness of both emergency contraception pills. However, it's important to remember that the sooner you take emergency contraception after sex, the more effective it will be. How it affects your period After taking the emergency contraceptive pill, most women will have a normal period at the expected time. However, you may have your period later or earlier than normal. If your period is more than seven days late, or is unusually light or short, contact your GP as soon as possible to check for pregnancy. Who can use the emergency pill? Most women can use the emergency contraceptive pill. This includes women who cannot usually use hormonal contraception, such as the combined pill and contraceptive patch. Girls aged under 16 years old can also use the emergency contraceptive pill. Levonelle The WHO does not identify any medical condition that would mean a woman shouldn\u2019t use Levonelle. ellaOne The manufacturer of ellaOne advises that it should not be used by women who:  are allergic to any of the components of the drug have severe asthma that is treated with glucocorticoids (steroid) tablets have certain rare hereditary problems with lactose metabolism ellaOne may not be effective in women who are taking liver enzyme-inducing medication. For more information, read The emergency pill and other medicines. Breastfeeding Levonelle Levonelle can be taken while breastfeeding. Although small amounts of the hormones contained in the pill may pass into your breast milk, it is not thought to be harmful to your baby. ellaOne The safety of ellaOne during breastfeeding is not yet known.

The IUD as emergency contraception An intrauterine device (IUD) How the IUD works How effective the IUD is at preventing pregnancy Who can use the IUD During pregnancy and breastfeeding Side effects of using the IUD  The IUD and other medicines How the IUD works The intrauterine device (IUD) is a small, T-shaped contraceptive device made from plastic and copper. It\u2019s inserted into the uterus by a trained health professional. It may prevent an egg from implanting in your womb or being fertilised. If you\u2019ve had unprotected sex, the IUD can be inserted up to five days afterwards, or up to five days after the earliest time you could have ovulated, to prevent pregnancy. It\u2019s more effective at preventing pregnancy than the emergency pill, and it does not interact with any other medication. You can also choose to have the IUD left in as an ongoing method of contraception. How effective is the IUD at preventing pregnancy? There are several types of IUD. Newer ones have more copper and are more than 99% effective. Fewer than two women in 100 who use a newer IUD over five years will get pregnant. IUDs with less copper in them are less effective than this, but are still effective. The IUD is more effective than the emergency pill at preventing pregnancy after unprotected sex. Who can use the IUD? Most women can use an IUD, including women who have never been pregnant and those who are HIV positive. Your GP or clinician will ask about your medical history to check if an IUD is suitable for you. You should not use an IUD if you have: an untreated STI or a pelvic infection certain abnormalities of the womb or cervix any unexplained bleeding from your vagina \u2013 for example, between periods or after sex Women who have a heart condition should consult their GP or cardiologist before having an IUD fitted. Pregnancy and breastfeeding The IUD should not be inserted if there is a risk that you may already be pregnant. The IUD can be used safely if you\u2019re breastfeeding, but the risk of complications during insertion is slightly higher. What are the side effects of the IUD Complications after having an IUD fitted are rare, but can include pain, infection, damage to the womb or expulsion (the IUD coming out of your womb). If you use the IUD as an ongoing method of regular contraception, it may make your periods longer, heavier or more painful. The IUD and other medicines The emergency IUD will not react with any other medication. Where can I get emergency contraception? You can get the emergency contraceptive pill and the IUD for free from: a GP surgery that provides contraception (some GP surgeries may not provide the IUD) a contraception clinic  a sexual health clinic (find sexual health services near you) some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics some young people's clinics (call 0300 123 7123) You can also get the emergency contraceptive pill free from: most pharmacies (find pharmacies near you)  some NHS walk-in centres and minor injuries units some Accident & Emergency departments The doctor or nurse you see may ask for the following information: when you have had unprotected sex in your current menstrual cycle the date of the first day of your last period and the usual length of your cycle details of any contraceptive failure (such as how many pills you may have missed, and when) if you've used any medications that may affect your contraception You can buy the emergency contraceptive pill from most pharmacies if you're aged 16 or over and from some organisations such as bpas or Marie Stopes. The cost varies, but it will be around £30 to £35. Contraception for the future If you're not using a regular method of contraception, you might consider doing so in order to lower the risk of unintended pregnancy.

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: Emergency contraception (morning after pill, IUD) Emergency contraception can prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or if your contraceptive method has failed \u2013 for example, a condom has split or you've missed a pill. There are two types:  the emergency contraceptive pill (sometimes called the morning after pill) the IUD (intrauterine device, or coil) At a glance: emergency contraception   The emergency pill    The IUD as emergency contraception   Where to get emergency contraception   Contraception for the future There are two kinds of emergency contraceptive pill. Levonelle has to be taken within 72 hours (three days) of sex, and ellaOne has to be taken within 120 hours (five days) of sex. Both pills work by preventing or delaying ovulation (release of an egg). The IUD can be inserted into your uterus up to five days after unprotected sex, or up to five days after the earliest time you could have ovulated. It may stop an egg from being fertilised or implanting in your womb. Emergency contraception does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). At a glance: facts about emergency contraception Both types of emergency contraception are effective at preventing pregnancy if they are used soon after unprotected sex. Less than 1% of women who use the IUD get pregnant, whereas pregnancies after the emergency contraceptive pill are not as rare. It\u2019s thought that ellaOne is more effective than Levonelle. The sooner you take Levonelle or ellaOne, the more effective it will be. Levonelle or ellaOne can make you feel sick, dizzy or tired, or give you a headache, tender breasts or abdominal pain. Levonelle or ellaOne can make your period earlier or later than usual. If you\u2019re sick (vomit) within two hours of taking Levonelle, or three hours of taking ellaOne, seek medical advice as you will need to take another dose or have an IUD fitted. If you use the IUD as emergency contraception, it can be left in as your regular contraceptive method. If you use the IUD as a regular method of contraception, it can make your periods longer, heavier or more painful. You may feel some discomfort when the IUD is put in \u2013 painkillers can help to relieve this. There are no serious side effects of using emergency contraception. Emergency contraception does not cause an abortion. The emergency pill How the emergency pill works How effective the emergency pill is at preventing pregnancy How it affects your period  Who can use the emergency pill  During breastfeeding If you're already using the pill, patch, vaginal ring or injection Side effects of the emergency pill The emergency pill and other medicines Can I get the emergency pill in advance? How the emergency pill works Levonelle Levonelle contains levonorgestrel, a synthetic version of the natural hormone progesterone. In a woman\u2019s body, progesterone plays a role in ovulation and preparing the uterus for accepting a fertilised egg. It\u2019s not known exactly how Levonelle works, but it\u2019s thought to work primarily by preventing or delaying ovulation. It does not interfere with your regular method of contraception. ellaOne ellaOne contains ulipristal acetate, which stops progesterone working normally. It prevents pregnancy mainly by preventing or delaying ovulation.` Levonelle and ellaOne do not continue to protect you against pregnancy. This means that if you have unprotected sex at any time after taking the emergency pill you can become pregnant. Even if you are starting or continuing another method of hormonal contraception, it may not be effective immediately. You will need to use condoms or avoid sex until the contraception is working effectively. The time it takes for contraception to become effective depends on the emergency contraceptive pill and the method of hormonal contraception being started. Your doctor or nurse will tell you when you can start hormonal contraception and how long you will need to take additional precautions to prevent an unintended pregnancy. Levonelle and ellaOne are not intended to be used as a regular form of contraception. However, you can use emergency contraception more than once in a menstrual cycle if necessary. How effective is the emergency pill at preventing pregnancy? You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services some pharmacies  Find a clinic near you It can be difficult to know how many pregnancies the emergency pill prevents, because there is no way to know for sure how many women would have got pregnant if they did not take it. A study published in 2010 showed that of 1,696 women who received the emergency pill within 72 hours of sex, 37 became pregnant (1,659 did not). Of 203 women who took the emergency pill between 72 and 120 hours after unprotected sex, there were three pregnancies. Find out more about the research on the effectiveness of both emergency contraception pills. However, it's important to remember that the sooner you take emergency contraception after sex, the more effective it will be. How it affects your period After taking the emergency contraceptive pill, most women will have a normal period at the expected time. However, you may have your period later or earlier than normal. If your period is more than seven days late, or is unusually light or short, contact your GP as soon as possible to check for pregnancy. Who can use the emergency pill? Most women can use the emergency contraceptive pill. This includes women who cannot usually use hormonal contraception, such as the combined pill and contraceptive patch. Girls aged under 16 years old can also use the emergency contraceptive pill. Levonelle The WHO does not identify any medical condition that would mean a woman shouldn\u2019t use Levonelle. ellaOne The manufacturer of ellaOne advises that it should not be used by women who:  are allergic to any of the components of the drug have severe asthma that is treated with glucocorticoids (steroid) tablets have certain rare hereditary problems with lactose metabolism ellaOne may not be effective in women who are taking liver enzyme-inducing medication. For more information, read The emergency pill and other medicines. Breastfeeding Levonelle Levonelle can be taken while breastfeeding. Although small amounts of the hormones contained in the pill may pass into your breast milk, it is not thought to be harmful to your baby. ellaOne The safety of ellaOne during breastfeeding is not yet known. The manufacturer recommends that you do not breastfeed for one week after taking this pill. If you are already using the pill, patch, vaginal ring or contraceptive injection You may need to take the emergency pill if you: forgot to take some of your regular contraceptive pills, or did not use your contraceptive patch or vaginal ring correctly, or were late having your contraceptive implant or contraceptive injection If you have taken Levonelle, then you should:  take your next contraceptive pill, apply a new patch or insert a new ring within 12 hours of taking the emergency pill You should then continue taking your regular contraceptive pill as normal. You will need to use additional contraception, such as condoms, for: the next seven days if you use the patch, ring, combined pill (except Qlaira), implant or injection nine days for the combined pill Qlaira  the next two days if you use the progestogen-only pill If you have taken ellaOne, you will need to wait at least five days before taking your next contraceptive pill, applying a new patch or inserting a new ring. You should then use additional contraception, such as condoms, while waiting to restart your contraceptive method and then for: the next seven days if you use the patch, ring, combined pill (except Qlaira), implant or injection nine days for the combined pill Qlaira  the next two days if you use the progestogen-only pill What are the side effects of using the emergency pill?

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: IUD (intrauterine device) A woman can get pregnant if a man\u2019s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping eggs being produced. One method of contraception is the intrauterine device, or IUD (sometimes called a coil). At a glance: facts about the IUD   How the IUD works   Who can use the IUD   Advantages and disadvantages of the IUD   Risks of the IUD   Where you can get an IUD An IUD is a small T-shaped plastic and copper device that\u2019s inserted into your womb (uterus) by a specially trained doctor or nurse.  The IUD works by stopping the sperm and egg from surviving in the womb or fallopian tubes. It may also prevent a fertilised egg from implanting in the womb. The IUD is a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method. This means that once it's in place, you don't have to think about it each day or each time you have sex. There are several types and sizes of IUD. You can use an IUD whether or not you've had children.   At a glance: facts about the IUD There are different types of IUD, some with more copper than others. IUDs with more copper are more than 99% effective. This means that fewer than one in 100 women who use an IUD will get pregnant in one year. IUDs with less copper will be less effective.  An IUD works as soon as it's put in, and lasts for five to 10 years, depending on the type. It can be put in at any time during your menstrual cycle, as long as you're not pregnant. It can be removed at any time by a specially trained doctor or nurse and you'll quickly return to normal levels of fertility. Changes to your periods (for example, being heavier, longer or more painful) are common in the first three to six months after an IUD is put in, but they're likely to settle down after this. You might get spotting or bleeding between periods.  There's a very small chance of infection within 20 days of the IUD being fitted.  There's a risk that your body may expel the IUD. If you get pregnant, there's an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy (when the egg implants outside the womb). But because you're unlikely to get pregnant, the overall risk of ectopic pregnancy is lower than in women who don't use contraception.  Having the IUD put in can be uncomfortable. Ask the doctor or nurse about pain relief. An IUD may not be suitable for you if you've had previous pelvic infections. The IUD does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using condoms as well as the IUD, you'll help to protect yourself against STIs. How the IUD works How it prevents pregnancy Having an IUD fitted How to tell whether an IUD is still in place Removing an IUD How it prevents pregnancy The IUD is similar to the IUS (intrauterine system) but works in a different way. Instead of releasing the hormone progestogen like the IUS, the IUD releases copper. Copper changes the make-up of the fluids in the womb and fallopian tubes, stopping sperm surviving there. IUDs may also stop fertilised eggs from implanting in the womb. There are types and sizes of IUD to suit different women. IUDs need to be fitted by a trained doctor or nurse at your GP surgery, local contraception clinic or sexual health clinic. An IUD can stay in the womb for five to 10 years, depending on the type. If you're 40 or over when you have an IUD fitted, it can be left in until you reach the menopause or until you no longer need contraception. Having an IUD fitted An IUD can be fitted at any time during your menstrual cycle, as long as you are not pregnant. You'll be protected against pregnancy straight away. Before you have an IUD fitted, you will have an internal examination to find out the size and position of your womb. This is to make sure that the IUD can be put in the correct place. You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you You may also be tested for infections, such as STIs. It's best to do this before an IUD is fitted so that you can have treatment (if you need it) before the IUD is put in. Sometimes, you may be given antibiotics at the same time as the IUD is fitted. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to insert an IUD. The vagina is held open, like it is during a cervical screening (smear) test, and the IUD is inserted through the cervix and into the womb. The fitting process can be uncomfortable and sometimes painful. You may get cramps afterwards. You can ask for a local anaesthetic or painkillers before having the IUD fitted. An anaesthetic injection itself can be painful, so many women have the procedure without. You may get pain and bleeding for a few days after having an IUD fitted. Discuss this with your GP or nurse beforehand.   The IUD needs to be checked by a doctor after three to six weeks. Speak to your doctor or nurse if you have any problems before or after this first check or if you want the IUD removed. Speak to your doctor or nurse if you or your partner are at risk of getting an STI. This is because STIs can lead to an infection in the pelvis. See your GP or go back to the clinic where your IUD was fitted as soon as you can if you: have pain in your lower abdomen have a high temperature have a smelly discharge These may mean you have an infection. How to tell whether an IUD is still in place An IUD has two thin threads that hang down a little way from your womb into the top of your vagina. The doctor or nurse who fits your IUD will teach you how to feel for these threads and check that it is still in place. Check your IUD is in place a few times in the first month, and then after each period or at regular intervals.  It's very unlikely that your IUD will come out, but if you can't feel the threads, or if you think the IUD has moved, you may not be fully protected against getting pregnant. See your doctor or nurse straight away and use an extra method of contraception, such as condoms, until your IUD has been checked. If you've had sex recently, you may need to use emergency contraception. Your partner shouldn't be able to feel your IUD during sex. If he can feel the threads, get your doctor or nurse to check that your IUD is in place. They may be able to cut the threads to a shorter length. If you feel any pain during sex, go for a check-up. Removing an IUD An IUD can be removed at any time by a trained doctor or nurse. If you're not going to have another IUD put in and you don't want to get pregnant, use another method (such as condoms) for seven days before you have the IUD removed. This is to stop sperm getting into your body. Sperm can live for up to seven days in the body and could make you pregnant once the IUD is removed. As soon as an IUD is taken out, your normal fertility should return.  Who can use an IUD Most women can use an IUD. This includes women who have never been pregnant and those who are HIV positive. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your medical history to check if an IUD is the most suitable form of contraception for you. You should not use an IUD if you have: an untreated STI or a pelvic infection  problems with your womb or cervix  any unexplained bleeding from your vagina \u2013 for example, between periods or after sex Women who have had an ectopic pregnancy or recent abortion, or who have an artificial heart valve, must consult their GP or clinician before having an IUD fitted. You should not be fitted with an IUD if there's a chance that you are already pregnant or if you or your partner are at risk of catching STIs. If you or your partner are unsure, go to your GP or a sexual health clinic to be tested. Using an IUD after giving birth An IUD can usually be fitted four to six weeks after giving birth (vaginal or caesarean). You'll need to use alternative contraception from three weeks (21 days) after the birth until the IUD is fitted. In some cases, an IUD can be fitted within 48 hours of giving birth. An IUD is safe to use when you're breastfeeding and it won't affect your milk supply. Using an IUD after a miscarriage or abortion An IUD can be fitted straight away or within 48 hours after an abortion or miscarriage by an experienced doctor or nurse, as long as you were pregnant for less than 24 weeks. If you were pregnant for more than 24 weeks, you may have to wait a few weeks before having an IUD fitted.  Advantages and disadvantages of the IUD Although an IUD is an effective method of contraception, there are some things to consider before having one fitted. Advantages of the IUD Most women can use an IUD, including women who have never been pregnant. Once an IUD is fitted, it works straight away and lasts for up to 10 years or until it's removed. It doesn't interrupt sex. It can be used if you're breastfeeding. Your normal fertility returns as soon as the IUD is taken out It's not affected by other medicines. There's no evidence that having an IUD fitted will increase the risk of cancer of the cervix, endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the womb) or ovarian cancer. Some women experience changes in mood and libido, but these changes are very small. There is no evidence that the IUD affects weight. Disadvantages of the IUD Your periods may become heavier, longer or more painful, though this may improve after a few months.  An IUD doesn't protect against STIs, so you may have to use condoms as well. If you get an STI while you have an IUD, it could lead to a pelvic infection if not treated. The most common reasons that women stop using an IUD are vaginal bleeding and pain. Risks of the IUD Complications after having an IUD fitted are rare. Most will appear within the first year after fitting. Damage to the womb In fewer than one in 1,000 cases, an IUD can perforate (make a hole in) the womb or neck of the womb (cervix) when it's put in. This can cause pain in the lower abdomen, but doesn't usually cause any other symptoms. If the doctor or nurse fitting your IUD is experienced, the risk of this is very low. If perforation occurs, you may need surgery to remove the IUD. Contact your GP straight away if you feel a lot of pain after having an IUD fitted as perforations should be treated immediately. Pelvic infections Pelvic infections can occur in the first 20 days after the IUD is fitted. The risk of infection is very small. Fewer than one in 100 women who are at low risk of STIs will get a pelvic infection. Rejection Occasionally, the IUD is rejected (expelled) by the womb or can move (this is called displacement). This is more likely to happen soon after it has been fitted, although this is uncommon. Your doctor or nurse will teach you how to check that your IUD is in place. Ectopic pregnancy If the IUD fails and you become pregnant, your IUD should be removed as soon as possible if you're going to continue with the pregnancy. There's a small increased risk of ectopic pregnancy if a woman becomes pregnant while using an IUD. Where to get an IUD Most types of contraception are available free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics sexual health clinics \u2013 these offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people\u2019s services (call the sexual health line on 0300 123 7123 for details) Find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching your postcode or town. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacists won't tell your parents or carer, as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.   Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 12\/01\/2015 Next review due: 12\/01\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

They are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. Types of emollients Emollients are available as: moisturising creams, ointments, lotions and sprays bath oils and shower products soap substitutes They are available in tubes, tubs and larger pump dispensers, and can either be bought over the counter from your pharmacy or be prescribed by your GP, nurse or health visitor. If you or your children need to use an emollient regularly, it's a good idea to keep some in small pots or tubes at home, school or work. Leave-on products There are a variety of emollients that can be applied to the skin to help with specific problems. For example: occlusive emollient creams and ointments \u2013 these create a film over the skin to prevent water evaporating humectant-containing emollients \u2013 these contain additives such as urea glycerol, popylene glycol and lactic acid to attract and hold water in the top layer of skin antipruritic emollients \u2013 these contain ingredients to help treat itching antiseptic emollients \u2013 these contain ingredients to prevent infection The best emollient is the one that suits your skin condition. You should be given the opportunity to try a variety of emollients. Soap substitutes (emollient wash products) The everyday use of soaps, shampoos and shower gels can remove the surface layer of natural oils on your skin. This can make your skin dry and further aggravate long-term skin conditions such as eczema. Soap substitutes are one type of emollient that can be used instead of soap for handwashing and bathing. Although soap substitutes do not produce foam like normal soap, they are just as effective at cleaning the skin. Many of these leave-on products can also be used as a wash product. How they help Emollients work by: helping skin retain water moisturising dry skin easing itching reducing scaling softening cracks protecting the skin helping other creams and ointments to be absorbed into the skin How to use them Soap substitutes (emollient wash products) Mix a small amount of soap substitute in the palm of your hand (about half to one teaspoonful) with a little warm water, and spread it over damp or dry skin. Rinse and pat the skin dry, but do not rub. If you are using a soap substitute as well as other treatments, apply the soap substitute first. Allow 30 minutes after using a soap substitute before applying the other treatments. The soap substitute can be rubbed into the skin and showered or washed off in the bath. Although aqueous cream is often prescribed, it should not be used. There are better emollients available, as some people may have a reaction to aqueous cream used as an emollient. It also has a high water content, making it less effective than other products as a leave-on emollient. However, if your skin stings after using the emollient wash products and does not settle down after rinsing, speak to your GP or pharmacist about an alternative soap substitute. Bath additives Emollient bath additives can be added to lukewarm bath water to help prevent the loss of moisture from your skin. They can make surfaces slippery, so always use a non-slip mat and be careful when getting yourself or your child out of the bath. Some bath oils contain an antiseptic, which can help prevent infection. But these products should only be used occasionally, unless the infection is recurrent or widespread. Never use more than the recommended amount of bath additive. It may cause skin irritation if the concentration is too high, particularly when used with antiseptic bath oils. Creams and ointments Emollient creams are less greasy than emollient ointments. They are easy to spread, absorb easily into the skin and are good for use during the daytime. They can also be used on weeping eczema. Emollient ointments are most suitable for very dry, thick skin and are not suitable for use on weeping eczema. Find one that is best suited to your or your child's skin. Occasionally, emollient creams may sting when they are first applied to very dry skin. This usually settles down after a few days of treatment. If it persists, it may be caused by a reaction to a preservative in the cream. If this occurs, talk to your GP or pharmacist about possible alternative emollients, such as an emollient ointment. Emollients can be used to replace lost moisture whenever your skin feels dry or tight. They are very safe and you can't overuse them because they don't get absorbed through your skin into your body. You may need to try a variety of different emollients before you find one that is best suited to you or your child. For example, you may decide to use a cream-based emollient during the day and an ointment base at night. When to apply them Emollients can be applied as often as recommended by the manufacturer to keep the skin well moisturised and in good condition.  It's especially important to regularly apply an emollient to your hands and face because they are exposed to the elements more than any other part of your body. Certain activities, such as swimming or gardening, can irritate the skin, so it may help to apply an emollient beforehand.  For babies, it is a good idea to protect their hands and cheeks with an emollient before meal times to stop them getting sore from food and drinks. Emollients are best applied after washing your hands, taking a bath or showering because this is when the skin is moist. The emollient should ideally be applied to the skin at least three or four times a day. Whether you are prone to dry skin or not, it's a good idea to use an emollient cream or ointment after washing or bathing because this is when your skin is most in need of moisture. The emollient should be applied as soon as you have patted your skin dry to ensure it is properly absorbed. Possible reactions to emollients Possible reactions to emollients can include: irritant reactions \u2013 such as an overheating, burning sensation or stinging, usually caused by a reaction to a certain ingredient contained in the cream or lotion folliculitis \u2013 some emollients can occasionally cause hair follicles to become blocked and inflamed (folliculitis) and cause boils facial rashes \u2013 some facial emollients may cause rashes on the face that can aggravate acne If you experience painful stinging that continues, try a different emollient or speak to your local pharmacist for advice. You may be able to help prevent folliculitis by applying emollients gently and in the same direction your hair grows. Safety advice when using emollients if you are using paraffin-based emollients, keep away from fire, flames and cigarettes \u2013 dressings and clothing soaked with the ointment can be easily ignited if you keep your emollients in a pot or tub, use a clean spoon or spatula to remove the product \u2013 this reduces the risk of infections from contaminated pots take care when using emollients in a bath, shower or on a tiled floor as there's a risk of slipping \u2013 protect the floor with a towel or sheet, wash your bath or shower afterwards with hot water and washing up liquid, then dry with a kitchen towel avoid using aqueous cream \u2013 recent evidence has shown it can cause burning, stinging, itching and redness, especially in children with atopic eczema Read more information about the safety of aqueous cream on the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) website. Treating skin conditions It's important to use emollients even when your skin condition is not flaring up and to make sure you don't run out. After applying emollients, allow 30 minutes before using topical corticosteroids or other treatments applied to the skin. This avoids diluting their effect, spreading them to areas that don't need treating, and increasing the risk of side effects on normal skin. Emollients are commonly used to treat dry skin conditions such as: eczema \u2013 a long-term skin condition that causes the skin to become reddened, dry, itchy and cracked (read more about treating eczema) psoriasis \u2013 a long-term skin condition that causes red, flaky patches of skin covered with silvery scales (read more about treating psoriasis) ichthyosis \u2013 a long-term condition that results in persistently thick, dry, \"fish-scale\" skin If you have a dry skin condition such as eczema, psoriasis or ichthyosis, use a medicated emollient, even when your skin feels better, to help prevent patches of inflammation and flare-ups. This is because dry skin is more prone to infection. Video: emollients Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

People with COPD have difficulties breathing, primarily due to the narrowing of their airways, this is called airflow obstruction. Typical symptoms of COPD include: increasing breathlessness when active a persistent cough with phlegm frequent chest infections Read more about the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Why does COPD happen? The main cause of COPD is smoking. The likelihood of developing COPD increases the more you smoke and the longer you've been smoking. This is because smoking irritates and inflames the lungs, which results in scarring. Over many years, the inflammation leads to permanent changes in the lung. The walls of the airways thicken and more mucus is produced. Damage to the delicate walls of the air sacs in the lungs causes emphysema and the lungs lose their normal elasticity. The smaller airways also become scarred and narrowed. These changes cause the symptoms of breathlessness, cough and phlegm associated with COPD. Some cases of COPD are caused by fumes, dust, air pollution and genetic disorders, but these are rarer. Read more about the causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Who is affected? COPD is one of the most common respiratory diseases in the UK. It usually only starts to affect people over the age of 35, although most people are not diagnosed until they are in their 50s. It is thought there are more than 3 million people living with the disease in the UK, of which only about 900,000 have been diagnosed. This is because many people who develop symptoms of COPD do not get medical help because they often dismiss their symptoms as a \u2018smoker\u2019s cough\u2019. COPD affects more men than women, although rates in women are increasing. Diagnosis It is important that COPD is diagnosed as early as possible so treatment can be used to try to slow down the deterioration of your lungs. You should see your GP if you have any of the symptoms mentioned above. COPD is usually diagnosed after a consultation with your doctor, which may be followed by breathing tests. Read more about diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Treating COPD Although the damage that has already occurred to your lungs cannot be reversed, you can slow down the progression of the disease. Stopping smoking is particularly effective at doing this. Treatments for COPD usually involve relieving the symptoms with medication, for example by using an inhaler to make breathing easier. Pulmonary rehabilitation may also help increase the amount of exercise you are capable of doing. Surgery is only an option for a small number of people with COPD. Read more about treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Living with COPD COPD can affect your life in many ways, but help is available to reduce its impact. Simple steps such as living in a healthy way, being as active as possible, learning breathing techniques, and taking your medication can help you to reduce the symptoms of COPD. Financial support and advice about relationships and end of life care is also available for people with COPD. Read more about living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Want to know more? British Lung Foundation: COPD Can COPD be prevented? Although COPD causes about 25,000 deaths a year in the UK, severe COPD can usually be prevented by making changes to your lifestyle. If you smoke, stopping is the single most effective way to reduce your risk of getting the condition. Research has shown you are up to four times more likely to succeed in giving up smoking if you use NHS support along with stop-smoking medicines such as patches or gum. Ask your doctor about this, call the NHS Smoking Helpline on 0300 123 1044 or go to the NHS Smokefree website. Also avoid exposure to tobacco smoke as much as possible. Want to know more?

They can form if a bacterial infection is left untreated, or if it fails to fully respond to treatment. The term 'empyema' is most commonly used to refer to pus-filled pockets that develop in the pleural space. This is the slim space between the outside of the lungs and the inside of the chest cavity. Empyema is a serious condition which requires treatment. It can cause fever, chest pains, breathlessness and coughing up mucus \u2013 see What are the symptoms?  Although it can occasionally be life-threatening, it's not a common condition, as most bacterial infections are effectively treated with antibiotics before they get to this stage.  What causes empyema? The lungs and inside of the chest cavity are lined with a smooth layer called the pleura. These layers are almost in contact, but separated by a thin space \u2013 the pleural space \u2013 filled with a small amount of lubricant called pleural fluid. The pleural fluid can sometimes build up and become infected, so that a collection of pus forms. This can thicken and cause areas of the pleura to stick together, creating pockets of pus. Empyema can worsen to become many more pockets of pus, with thick deposits coating the outer layer of the lungs. These deposits prevent the lungs expanding properly. Pneumonia and other possible causes The most common cause of empyema is pneumonia caused by a bacterial infection of the lungs. An empyema can form when pneumonia fails to fully respond to treatment in a straightforward way. Other possible causes are: Bronchiectasis, a long-term condition where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened, leading to a build-up of mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. A blood clot or other blockage preventing blood flow to the lungs, causing some of the lung tissue to die. This is known as a pulmonary infarction. Surgery to the chest (empyema is a rare complication). An endoscopy (empyema is a rare complication). A serious injury to the chest. An infection elsewhere in the body that has spread via the bloodstream. An infection caused by inhaled food, if you have swallowing problems (but this is rare). Tuberculosis (this is rare in the UK). You're more at risk of developing an empyema if you: have diabetes have a weakened immune system have acid reflux drink too much alcohol or take a lot of recreational drugs Both adults and children can be affected. What are the symptoms? An empyema can be distressing and uncomfortable. It can cause: a fever and night sweats a lack of energy difficulty breathing weight loss chest pain a cough, and coughing up mucus containing pus  How is it diagnosed? An empyema is usually suspected when a person with severe pneumonia does not improve with treatment, and they start to show some of the above symptoms. If the patient is coughing up mucus, a sample of this should be taken to be inspected under a microscope. The type of bacteria causing the infection is identified so the most effective antibiotics can be given. A blood sample will also be taken, to count the number of white blood cells and other markers of infection. An X-ray or ultrasound scan will show whether there is a collection of fluid building up around the lungs and how much there is. Often a CT scan may also be used to give a more detailed assessment. How is it treated? Antibiotics given via a drip Some patients will just need antibiotics given intravenously (directly into a vein through a drip). However, they may need to stay in hospital for a long period. Chest drain Some patients may need both antibiotics and a chest drain. A chest drain is a flexible plastic tube inserted through the chest wall and into the affected area, to drain it of fluid. The area where the tube is inserted is numbed, and the patient may also be given a light sedative before having the drain inserted. Painkillers are given to ease any pain while the chest drain is in. The chest tube usually stays in place until an X-ray or ultrasound scan shows all the fluid has drained from the chest and the lungs are fully expanded. Sometimes injections may be given through the chest drain to help clear the infected pockets of pus. The patient may need to stay in hospital until the tube is removed. Some patients may be able to go home with the chest tube still in place \u2013 in which case a specialist nurse will offer support and advice on how to manage this at home. The nurse will demonstrate how to position, empty and change the bag, until the family or patient feels confident to do this themselves. For more information, read this NHS factsheet on chest drains (PDF, 148kb). Surgery to remove the lung lining Surgery may be needed if the condition doesn't improve. This involves making an incision (cut) in the chest to access the lungs, and removing the thick layer coating the lungs, so they can expand properly again. This is only carried out if other treatments haven't worked. Your surgeon or specialist will explain the benefits and risks of the procedure. Read more about lung surgery. Stoma A chest drain is not suitable for all patients. Some will instead opt to have an opening made in their chest, known as a stoma. A special bag is placed over the stoma to collect the fluid that leaks from the empyema. This is worn on the body, and may be more discreet and interfere less with your lifestyle than a chest drain. However, with modern treatments getting a stoma is uncommon.

It usually begins with flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, headache and joint pain. More serious symptoms may then develop over the next few hours or days, including: changes in mental state, such as confusion, drowsiness or disorientation seizures (fits) changes in personality and behaviour Flu-like symptoms that rapidly get worse and affect mental state should be treated as a medical emergency. Dial 999 immediately to request an ambulance. Read more about the symptoms of encephalitis. What causes encephalitis? There are several different types of encephalitis and each type has a different cause. The most common types of encephalitis are: infectious \u2013 inflammation occurs as a direct result of an infection, which is often viral post-infectious \u2013 inflammation is caused by the immune system reacting to a previous infection, and can occur days, weeks or months after the initial infection autoimmune \u2013 inflammation is caused by the immune system reacting to a non-infectious cause, such as a tumour   chronic \u2013 inflammation develops slowly over many months and can be due to a condition such as HIV; in some cases, there's no obvious cause There are also several types of encephalitis spread by mosquitoes, such as Japanese encephalitis, and ticks, such as tick-borne encephalitis. Encephalitis can also be caused by rabies. Read more about the causes of encephalitis. In the UK, all types of encephalitis are relatively rare. The Encephalitis Society estimates that there are 4,000 case of encephalitis in the UK each year. Anyone can be affected by encephalitis, but the very young and the very old are most at risk, because their immune systems tend to be weaker. Treating encephalitis Encephalitis needs urgent treatment, usually in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU). The earlier it's diagnosed, the more successful treatment is. Treatment depends on the type of encephalitis you have, but may include: anti-viral medication steroid injections immunosuppressants (medicines that stop the immune system attacking healthy tissue) Read more about diagnosing encephalitis and treating encephalitis. Complications Some people make a full recovery after having encephalitis. However, for many it can lead to permanent brain damage and complications, including: memory loss  epilepsy personality and behavioural changes problems with attention, concentration, planning and problem solving   fatigue (extreme tiredness) Overall, about 10% of encephalitis cases are fatal. Read more about the complications of encephalitis. Preventing encephalitis It's not always possible to prevent encephalitis. This is because it can be a rare complication of a relatively common infection. The most effective way to reduce your risk of getting encephalitis is to ensure you have the MMR vaccine (for measles, mumps and rubella). Practicing good hygiene \u2013 for example, regularly washing your hands with soap and warm water can help to reduce your risk of developing common infections. Other vaccinations Vaccinations are also available for Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis and encephalitis caused by rabies. These types of encephalitis are rare in the UK, but more widespread in certain parts of the world. For example, rabies tends to be more common in Africa, Japanese encephalitis is more common in Asia, and the risk areas for tick-borne encephalitis are the forests of central, eastern and northern Europe. You should discuss these specific vaccinations with your GP before travelling. Read more about the Japanese encephalitis vaccination, preventing tick-borne encephalitis and the rabies vaccination.

It's most common in rural areas throughout South East Asia, the Pacific islands and the Far East, but is very rare in travellers. The virus is found in pigs and birds, and is passed to mosquitoes when they bite infected animals. It's more common in rural areas where there are pig farms and rice fields. It can't be spread from person to person. There's currently no cure for Japanese encephalitis. Treatment involves supporting the functions of the body as it tries to fight off the infection. This usually requires the person being admitted to hospital, so they can be given fluids, oxygen and medication to treat any symptoms. Symptoms Most people infected by the Japanese encephalitis virus have either no symptoms, or mild, short-lived symptoms, which are often mistaken for flu. However, around 1 in every 250 people who become infected with Japanese encephalitis develop more severe symptoms, as the infection spreads to the brain. This usually happens 5-15 days after infection and symptoms can include: high temperature (fever) seizures (fits) stiff neck confusion inability to speak uncontrollable shaking of body parts (tremor) muscle weakness or paralysis Up to one in every three people who develop these more serious symptoms will die as a result of the infection. In those who survive, these symptoms tend to slowly improve. However, it can take several months to make a full recovery and up to half of those who do survive are left with permanent brain damage. This can lead to long-term problems such as tremors and muscle twitches, personality changes, muscle weakness, learning difficulties and paralysis in one or more limbs. When to seek medical advice You should seek immediate medical advice if you have any of the symptoms of Japanese encephalitis and have recently visited, or are still in, an area where the infection is found. GOV.UK has information about who to contact when you need immediate medical help abroad. If you're already back in the UK, see your GP. Your GP or the healthcare professional treating you will ask about your symptoms, where you've been travelling, what you did on your trip and what vaccinations you've had. If necessary, they may carry out a blood test to see if you have an infection. How common is Japanese encephalitis? It's very rare for travellers visiting risk areas to be affected by Japanese encephalitis. It's estimated that less than one in a million travellers develop Japanese encephalitis in any given year. There hasn't been a reported case in a traveller returning to the UK for more than 10 years. The people most at risk are those who live and work in rural areas where the condition is widespread. Around 75% of cases involve children under the age of 15. Find out more about the causes of Japanese encephalitis and the countries and activities which have a higher risk of catching the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates there are around 68,000 cases of Japanese encephalitis worldwide each year. Preventing Japanese encephalitis The best way to prevent Japanese encephalitis is to be vaccinated against the infection before you visit a part of the world where there's a risk of catching it. The risk is greater if you're planning to visit rural areas or go hiking or camping. The vaccine, which is usually only available privately, gives protection against Japanese encephalitis in more than 9 out of 10 people who receive it. Even if you've been vaccinated, you should still take precautions to reduce your risk of being bitten by an infected mosquito, such as: sleeping in rooms with close-fitting gauze over the windows and doors \u2013 if you're sleeping outside, use mosquito nets that have been impregnated with an insecticide covering up with long-sleeved tops, trousers and socks applying a good-quality insect repellent to exposed areas of skin Read more about preventing Japanese encephalitis. Accessing healthcare abroad It's a good idea to keep a list of important telephone numbers with you when travelling abroad. These should include numbers for: local emergency services a representative of the travel company you booked your visit with your travel insurer the British consulate or embassy in the area you are visiting \u2013 GOV.UK has a directory of British consulates and embassies Read more about accessing healthcare abroad.

It's a rare infection that's only acquired abroad in certain European and Asian countries (see 'Risk areas' below). Initial symptoms of TBE are similar to flu and can include: a high temperature (fever) a headache  tiredness  muscle pain These symptoms usually last for up to eight days, after which point most people make a full recovery. However, some people go on to develop more serious symptoms caused by the virus spreading to the protective layer of tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) or the brain itself (encephalitis). These 'second-stage' symptoms can include: changes in mental state, such as confusion, drowsiness or disorientation seizures (fits) sensitivity to bright light (photophobia) being unable to speak paralysis (inability to move certain body parts) If TBE reaches this stage, you'll usually need to be admitted to hospital. These symptoms tend to get slowly better over a few weeks, but it may take several months or years to make a full recovery and there's a risk you could experience long-term complications (see below). Around one in every 100 cases of TBE is fatal. Read more about the symptoms of tick-borne encephalitis. When to seek medical help Contact your GP if you've returned from an area of the world known to have cases of TBE (see below), and you start to experience flu-like symptoms. You should seek medical advice as soon as possible if you've been bitten by a tick while in a risk area and you haven't been vaccinated against TBE, or if you develop a rash or fever after being bitten. The advanced stages of TBE need emergency treatment in hospital. Call 999 (or the equivalent number where you're staying) immediately and ask for an ambulance if you have flu-like symptoms that are getting rapidly worse and affecting your mental state. Risk areas The TBE virus isn't present in the UK, so there's no risk of infection within the UK. However, cases of infection can occur among travellers returning from countries within Europe and Asia where TBE-infected ticks are found. Infected ticks are mainly found in rural areas of central, northern and eastern Europe. There are also two sub-types of TBE found in eastern Russia and in some countries in East Asia, particularly forested regions of China and Japan. Visit Travel Health Pro for a map showing the areas where infected ticks are found. How the infection is spread Ticks are found in forests, woods, grasslands, riverside meadows, marshes, brushwood and scrublands. They usually live in the undergrowth, where they can easily get onto people's clothes or skin. You can become infected with TBE if you're bitten by an infected tick. The virus is present in the tick\u2019s saliva, which also contains a natural anaesthetic so you may not notice you've been bitten. You can be bitten by an infected tick at any time of year, but tick activity is at its highest during the Spring and early Summer.  Drinking unpasteurised milk and eating unpasteurised dairy products from infected animals, particularly goats, can expose you to the TBE virus. However, this is rare. How common is tick-borne encephalitis? Very few cases of TBE have been reported in the UK, with just nine cases diagnosed in 2013\/14. However, TBE is fairly common in areas where infected ticks are found, so it's important to take steps to reduce your risk of infection (see below). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 10,000 and 12,000 cases of TBE are reported worldwide each year. However, the actual number of cases is thought to be much higher than this because it's likely that many cases aren't reported. How tick-borne encephalitis is treated If a doctor thinks you may have TBE, they'll carry out a blood test or lumbar puncture (where a sample of spinal fluid is removed) to confirm whether you're infected. There's currently no cure for TBE, so treatment aims to help relieve symptoms until the infection passes. If you only experience the initial symptoms of TBE, no treatment is required other than taking painkillers, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, to help relieve your symptoms. You'll usually be admitted to hospital if you develop second-stage symptoms. In hospital you'll receive fluids into a vein (intravenous fluids), help with breathing and nursing care.  Read more about treating viral meningitis and treating encephalitis. Possible complications If you develop second-stage symptoms of TBE caused by the infection spreading to the brain, there's a risk you could experience long-term (and possibly permanent) complications, such as: memory problems problems concentrating and a short attention span behavioural changes, such as becoming more impulsive and having poor judgement These types of long-term effects occur in more than one in 10 people who develop symptoms of TBE. Read more about the complications of tick-borne encephalitis. Preventing tick-borne encephalitis The best way to prevent TBE is to be vaccinated against the infection before you travel if you're going to be working or travelling in a part of the world where there's a risk of TBE, particularly if you're planning to visit rural areas or go hiking or camping. The vaccine, which is only available privately, provides protection against TBE in around nine out of every 10 people who receive it. Even if you've been vaccinated, you should still take precautions to reduce your risk of being bitten by an infected tick. For example, you should: wear long-sleeved tops and trousers tucked into your socks apply insect repellent containing DEET to exposed skin regularly check for ticks \u2013 common places to find them are around the hair line, behind the ears, on or around the elbows, the backs of the knees, the groin and the armpits Read more about preventing tick-borne encephalitis. Ticks in the UK You should also be aware that tick bites can spread other illnesses, such as Lyme disease, which you can get after being bitten by a tick in the UK. Therefore, follow the advice above to avoid tick bites when you and your family are in areas of the UK where ticks are commonly found.  Accessing healthcare abroad It's a good idea to keep a list of important telephone numbers with you when travelling abroad. These should include numbers for: the local emergency services a representative of the travel company you booked your visit with your travel insurer the British consulate or embassy in the area you're visiting \u2013 GOV.UK has a directory of British consulates and embassies You should also apply for a free European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before travelling to Europe because it may give you access to reduced-cost medical treatment.

The soiling usually happens during the day, when the child is awake and active. Although parents may find it frustrating, encopresis is very rarely thought to be caused by a child misbehaving. They usually can't help it and some children may not even realise they've had an accident. Children who have this problem may feel ashamed, guilty, frustrated or angry, and may act secretively to try to hide the problem.   If your child is aged four or older and soiling their clothes, or if they're constipated and reluctant to pass stools, see your GP. In the meantime, you can read on to learn the likely cause of your child's problems and how you can help them. Why is my child doing this? Most children who soil their pants are severely constipated. They may ignore the urge to go to the toilet and \"hold on\" to avoid the pain of passing stools. This leads to faecal impaction \u2013 when a large, solid stool becomes stuck in their rectum (back passage) and begins to stretch and weaken the surrounding muscle walls. Watery stools then leak out from around this blockage. At first, you may just notice streaks in your child's underwear and assume they aren't wiping properly, but it usually gets worse and can lead to entire bowel movements in their underwear. Children who don't get enough fibre and fluids in their diet may be at risk of becoming constipated. However, a poor diet alone is rarely the cause of childhood constipation. Constipation may also be related to a lack of toilet training or toilet training at too early an age. Constantly intervening when your child is using the toilet may make them feel anxious about it and reluctant to go, which only makes the problem worse.  For more information, read about the causes of constipation.  How would my GP diagnose and treat it? Your GP may want to physically examine your child to see if they have faecal impaction. This normally just involves feeling your child's tummy.  Sometimes an X-ray is needed to see how much stool is in your child's bowel and to see if their bowel is enlarged as a result.  If your child has faecal impaction, the first step is to prescribe laxatives to rid their bowel of the hard, retained stools and to prevent further constipation. Your child will also need to follow a balanced diet and be encouraged to pass stools regularly. These treatments are described in more detail below. Medication Your GP may prescribe an osmotic laxative such as macrogol, which is a sachet of powder you dissolve in water for your child to drink. This increases the amount of fluid in your child's bowel to soften their impacted stools and stimulate their body to push them out. Your doctor or nurse will explain how many sachets your child needs to take each day and how much water to add to the powder. Once the powder has been mixed with the water, you may add fruit juice or squash to improve the taste. To start with, your child will be on a higher dose to clear their bowel (disimpaction), then a reducing dose to maintain regular emptying of the bowel. Your doctor will tell you when to stop the medication, but this will be after the dosage has been gradually reduced. If you stop the laxatives abruptly or before your doctor recommends, the bowel may not have recovered to its usual size and function, and your child may become constipated again. Some children may need to continue taking laxatives for several years, and a few children for longer, to completely cure their constipation. The treatment to get rid of impacted stools may initially increase your child's soiling and tummy pain, but it's important to follow the course your doctor has prescribed. There's no evidence to support the commonly held belief that using laxatives produces a \"lazy bowel\". Read more about Movicol, including its side effects. Diet tips Your child should have a well-balanced diet that includes lots of fibre \u2013 fruit, vegetables and wholegrain foods, such as wholemeal bread and pasta. They should also drink plenty of fluids. Read about 5 A DAY and your family. Children with chronic (long-term) constipation normally don't have anything physically wrong with them, but it can take time to correct the problem, so be patient. Healthy toilet habits Try to minimise stress or conflict associated with using the toilet. Establish a regular routine where, for example, they sit on the toilet for 5 to 10 minutes after breakfast and again after dinner every day. Be positive and encouraging about this routine. Also, encourage your child to go to the toilet as soon as they have an urge to go. It might help to make a diary of your child's bowel movements linked to a reward system.

Outbreaks of typhus tend to occur in developing countries and areas where there is poverty, homelessness, close human contact and poor sanitation. The Rickettsia bacteria that cause typhus are carried by body lice, ticks, mites and fleas. This page covers the main types: epidemic typhus (the most serious form) \u2013 this type occurs in Africa, South America and Asia, and is transmitted by body lice  endemic typhus (the milder form of the disease) \u2013 it occurs throughout the world and is transmitted by ticks, mites and fleas  scrub typhus (also called Tsutsugamushi fever) \u2013 this type is caught from mites infected with Orientia tsutsugamushi bacteria, which live in heavy scrub vegetation in parts of rural southeast Asia, Oceania and northern Australia Typhus is generally not a problem in the UK. But you may become infected abroad if you catch Rickettsia-infected lice from infested people or bedding (in budget accommodation or on a sleeper train, for example), or if you are bitten by a Rickettsia-infected tick, mite or flea. How do you catch epidemic typhus? Epidemic typhus is passed from human to human by body lice. These are not the same as head lice or pubic lice, which are a nuisance, but don't transmit disease. The body lice become infected with Rickettsia prowazekii bacteria when they feed on the blood of an infected person. If you catch these infected body lice (for example, by using a louse-infested blanket), their infected faeces will be deposited on your skin as they feed on your blood. You only need to scratch a bite to rub the contaminated lice faeces into the tiny wound on your skin to become infected. Less commonly, you can catch epidemic typhus by breathing infected dried body louse faeces in airborne dust. How do you catch endemic typhus? Endemic typhus is transmitted by ticks, mites and fleas infected with Rickettsia bacteria. These animal carriers of typhus may live in thick scrub vegetation or on small mammals or rodents, such as rats. What are the symptoms? The symptoms of epidemic, endemic and scrub typhus are similar. Typically, someone with typhus will start to feel unwell 10 to 14 days after becoming infected. A sudden, severe headache is often the first symptom. Other symptoms may include: a fever \u2013 where body temperature rises above 38.9C\/102F for up to two weeks a pink or red rash that starts on the chest and spreads to the arms, hands, legs and feet \u2013 but not the face, palms and soles nausea and vomiting abdominal pain and diarrhoea joint and muscle pain \u2013 backache is common a cough In addition, the person with typhus is often mentally dazed or delirious \u2013 the word \"typhus\" comes from the Greek word meaning \"a cloud\". They may become deaf or have ringing in the ears (tinnitus). These symptoms usually last around two weeks. How is typhus diagnosed and treated? Anyone who is unwell shortly after visiting a high-risk country should see their GP, who will listen to your symptoms and take note of the countries you have recently visited. You will also be physically examined and have a number of tests \u2013 for example, a blood test to rule out other diseases such as malaria. If there is a rash, the GP may take a skin biopsy (a small sample of skin from the rash) and send this to a laboratory for testing. A diagnosis of typhus is confirmed if the Rickettsia bacteria are identified in a blood or skin sample. But the patient may be started on antibiotics even before the results come back if typhus is suspected. If treated promptly with either doxycycline or tetracycline, most patients improve dramatically within 48 hours of treatment and make a full recovery. If the patient has epidemic typhus (the more serious type), they may need to take antibiotics through a drip in their arm (intravenously) while they are in hospital. What are the possible complications? If typhus is not diagnosed and treated promptly, there is a risk of developing complications, including: long-term hearing loss or tinnitus low blood pressure organ damage and kidney failure secondary bacterial infection, such as pneumonia seizures confusion drowsiness gangrene The patient may need to have hospital follow-up for some months after recovering from an attack of typhus to receive treatment for these long-term problems. Brill-Zinsser disease Some people who previously had epidemic typhus will develop a milder form of the disease years later called Brill-Zinsser disease. This tends to happen when the bacteria were not properly killed off the first time and lie dormant (inactive) in the body. The bacteria then reactivate at a later date when the person's immune system is weak. Brill-Zinsser disease will need treating again with antibiotics. Can typhus be prevented? There's currently no licensed vaccine for typhus. The best way to avoid becoming infected with typhus is to avoid areas or crowds where louse-borne typhus is a problem, and take care to avoid contact with ticks, mites and fleas. Wash and change your clothes regularly, and don't use any bedding or clothing that could be infested with body lice. If you're about to travel abroad to an area where typhus is a problem, talk to your doctor about taking weekly doses of doxycycline to prevent infection. This is especially effective against scrub typhus.

It's most commonly caused by bacteria entering the blood and travelling to the heart. Although the heart is usually well protected against infection, it may be easier for bacteria to bypass the immune system in people who have: a prosthetic (artificial) heart valve \u2013 valve replacement surgery is increasingly being used when people experience narrowing of one of their heart valves congenital heart disease \u2013 where a person is born with heart defects hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \u2013 where the heart muscle cells have enlarged and the walls of the heart chambers thicken damaged heart valves \u2013 because of infection or heart disease People who inject drugs are also more likely to develop endocarditis. Read more about the causes of endocarditis. Symptoms of endocarditis The initial symptoms of endocarditis are similar to the flu and include: a high temperature (fever) of 38C (101.4F) or above  chills headache joint and muscle pain Without treatment, the infection damages the valves of the heart and disrupts the normal flow of blood through the heart. This triggers a range of life-threatening complications, such as: heart failure \u2013 where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body to properly meet the body\u2019s demands stroke \u2013 where the supply of blood to the brain becomes disrupted Read more about the symptoms of endocarditis. Treating endocarditis Endocarditis is treated with a course of antibiotics given via a drip. You'll need to be admitted to hospital for this. Around one in five people also need surgery to repair or replace a damaged heart valve or drain away any abscesses that develop. Endocarditis is a serious illness, especially if complications develop. Even with the highest standard of medical care the risk of dying is around one in five. Early diagnosis and treatment is vital to improve the outlook for the condition. Read more about the treatment of endocarditis. Who's affected? Endocarditis is a rare condition in England, even in those with a higher risk. It's estimated to affect around one in every 3,000 people every year. Endocarditis is more common in older people, with half of all cases developing in people aged over 50. However, cases of endocarditis have been recorded in children, particularly those born with congenital heart disease. Twice as many men are affected as women. Although it may sound strange, rates of endocarditis are increasing because of advances in medical care. This is due to an increasing number of people being treated with valve replacement surgery or surgery to repair congenital heart disease.

It's also called uterine cancer and endometrial cancer. Abnormal vaginal bleeding is the most common symptom of womb cancer. If you have been through the menopause, any vaginal bleeding is considered abnormal. If you have not yet been through the menopause, unusual bleeding may include bleeding between your periods. You should see your GP as soon as possible if you experience any unusual vaginal bleeding. While it's unlikely to be caused by womb cancer, it's best to be sure. Your GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms. They will refer you to a specialist for further tests if they suspect you may have a serious problem, or if they are unsure about a diagnosis. Read more about the symptoms of womb cancer and diagnosing womb cancer. Types of womb cancer The vast majority of womb cancers begin in the cells that make up the lining of the womb (called the endometrium), which is why cancer of the womb is often called endometrial cancer. In rare cases, womb cancer can start in the muscles surrounding the womb. This type of cancer is called uterine sarcoma and may be treated in a different way from endometrial cancer. This article uses the term womb cancer, and mostly includes information about endometrial cancer. Read more information about soft tissue sarcomas. Womb cancer is separate from other cancers of the female reproductive system, such as ovarian cancer and cervical cancer. Why does womb cancer happen? It's not clear exactly what causes womb cancer, but certain things can increase your risk of developing the condition. A hormone imbalance is one of the most important risks for womb cancer. Specifically, your risk is increased if you have high levels of a hormone called oestrogen in your body. A number of things can cause this hormone imbalance, including obesity, diabetes, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT). There is also a small increase in the risk of womb cancer with long-term use of the breast cancer drug tamoxifen. It's not always possible to prevent womb cancer, but some things are thought to reduce your risk. This includes maintaining a healthy weight and the long-term use of some types of contraception. Read more about the causes of womb cancer and preventing womb cancer. How is womb cancer treated? The most common treatment for womb cancer is the surgical removal of the womb (hysterectomy). A hysterectomy can cure womb cancer in its early stages, but you will no longer be able to get pregnant. Surgery for womb cancer is also likely to include the removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Radiotherapy or chemotherapy are also sometimes used, often in conjunction with surgery. A type of hormone therapy may be used if you are yet to go through the menopause and would still like to have children. Even if your cancer is advanced and the chances of a cure are small, treatment can still help to relieve symptoms and prolong your life. Read more about treating womb cancer. Living with womb cancer Living with cancer is challenging and womb cancer can affect your life in specific ways. For example, your sex life may be affected if you have a hysterectomy. You may find it physically more difficult to have sex and have a reduced sex drive. You may find it beneficial to talk to other people about your condition, including family members, your partner, or other people with womb cancer. Read more about living with womb cancer. Who is affected? Womb cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer of the female reproductive system. It's the fourth most common cancer diagnosed in women after breast cancer, lung cancer, and cancer of the colon and rectum. In the UK, about 8,475 new cases of womb cancer are diagnosed each year. Womb cancer is more common in women who have been through the menopause, and most cases are diagnosed in women aged 40 to 74. Womb cancer accounts for about 3% of all cancers diagnosed in women.

These pieces of tissue can be found in many different areas of the body, including: the ovaries and fallopian tubes outside the womb the lining of the inside of the abdomen the bowel or bladder The condition is estimated to affect around 2 million women in the UK. Most of them are diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 40. Endometriosis is rare in women who have been through the menopause. Symptoms of endometriosis Endometriosis is a long-term (chronic) condition. Symptoms can vary significantly from person to person, and some women have no symptoms at all. The most common symptoms include: painful periods or heavy periods pain in the lower abdomen (tummy), pelvis or lower back pain during and after sex bleeding between periods difficulty getting pregnant Most women with endometriosis get pain in the area between their hips and the tops of their legs. Some women experience this pain all the time. Other symptoms may include: persistent exhaustion and tiredness discomfort when going to the toilet bleeding from your back passage (rectum) or blood in your poo coughing blood \u2013 in rare cases when the endometriosis tissue is in the lung How severe the symptoms are depends on where in your body the abnormal tissue is, rather than the amount of tissue you have. A small amount could be more painful than a large amount. What causes endometriosis? The causes of endometriosis aren't fully known, but there are several theories. The most widely accepted theory is the womb lining doesn't leave the body properly during a period and embeds itself on the organs of the pelvis. This is known as retrograde menstruation. However, this doesn't explain why the condition can occur in women who have had a hysterectomy. Read about the possible causes of endometriosis. Diagnosing endometriosis See your GP if you have symptoms of endometriosis so they can try to identify a cause. They may refer you to a gynaecologist, a specialist in problems affecting the female reproductive system. It can be difficult to diagnose endometriosis because the symptoms can vary considerably, and many other conditions can cause similar symptoms.  Your gynaecologist will ask about your symptoms, your periods and possibly your sexual activity. They may also carry out an internal pelvic exam or recommend an ultrasound scan to look for cysts in your ovaries that may have been caused by endometriosis. Laparoscopy Endometriosis can only be confirmed with a surgical examination called a laparoscopy. This is carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're put to sleep) and you can usually go home the same day. A thin tube with a light on the end (laparoscope) will be passed into your body through a small cut in your skin at your belly button. It has a tiny camera that transmits images to a video monitor so the specialist can see any endometriosis tissue. During the procedure, a small sample of tissue (biopsy) can be taken for laboratory testing, or other surgical instruments can be inserted to treat the endometriosis.  How endometriosis is treated The symptoms of endometriosis can often be managed with painkillers and hormone medication, which help prevent the condition interfering with your daily life. However, there's no known cure for endometriosis. Patches of endometriosis tissue can sometimes be surgically removed to improve symptoms and fertility. Endometriosis can be a difficult condition to deal with, both physically and emotionally. Charities such as Endometriosis SHE Trust UK and Endometriosis UK can offer advice and support to help you cope. Read more about treating endometriosis. Endometriosis and pregnancy One of the main complications of endometriosis is difficulty getting pregnant or not being able to get pregnant at all (infertility). Although surgery can't guarantee you'll be able to get pregnant, there's good evidence that removing endometriosis tissue with a laser or an electric current during keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery can improve your chances of having a successful pregnancy. If you have endometriosis and you do become pregnant, the condition is unlikely to put your pregnancy at risk. Pregnancy sometimes reduces the symptoms of endometriosis, although they often return once you've given birth and finished breastfeeding, and the menstrual cycle returns to normal.

Endoscope An endoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube that has a light source and a video camera at one end. Images of the inside of your body are relayed to a television screen. Endoscopes can be inserted into the body through a natural opening, such as the mouth and down the throat, or through the anus (via the bottom). Alternatively, an endoscope can be inserted through a small surgical cut made in the skin (known as keyhole surgery). What happens during an endoscopy? An endoscopy is normally carried out while a person is conscious. It is not usually painful, but can be uncomfortable, so a local anaesthetic or sedative (medication that has a calming effect) may be given to help you relax. The endoscope is carefully inserted into your body. Exactly where it enters your body will depend on the part of the body being examined. An endoscopy can take 60 minutes to carry out, depending on what it's being used for. It will usually be performed on an outpatient basis, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. Read more about how an endoscopy is performed. Risks An endoscopy is usually safe, and the risk of serious complications is low. Possible complications of an endoscopy include an infection in the part of the body that the endoscope is used to examine, and excessive bleeding. Read more about the risks of an endoscopy. Types of endoscope Some of the most commonly used types of endoscopes include: colonoscopes \u2013 used to examine your large intestine (colon) gastroscopes \u2013 used to examine your oesophagus and stomach endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) \u2013 used to check for gallstones broncoscopes \u2013 used to examine your lungs and airways Other types of endoscope include: arthroscopes \u2013 used to examine the joints hysteroscopes \u2013 used to examine the womb (uterus) in woman cystoscopes \u2013 used to examine the bladder An endoscopy can be used to investigate an area of the body if symptoms suggest there might be a problem. It can also be used to help perform some types of keyhole surgery (laparoscopy), such as removing the appendix or gallbladder. Read more about when an endoscopy is used. Is having an endoscopy painful? In the majority of cases, no. Most people will only experience some mild discomfort, similar to indigestion or having a sore throat.  The exception is keyhole surgery, such as a laparoscopy or an arthroscopy, which are performed under general anaesthetic (where you are asleep). Discuss any concerns with staff at the hospital or clinic. They may recommend that you are sedated so you are more relaxed during the procedure.

It's also sometimes referred to as an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.  The endoscope has a light and a camera at one end. The camera sends images of the inside of your oesophagus, stomach and duodenum to a monitor. Why a gastroscopy may be used  A gastroscopy can be used to: investigate problems such as difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) or persistent abdominal (tummy) pain diagnose conditions such as stomach ulcers or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) treat conditions such as bleeding ulcers, a blockage in the oesophagus, non-cancerous growths (polyps) or small cancerous tumours A gastroscopy used to check symptoms or confirm a diagnosis is known as a diagnostic gastroscopy. A gastroscopy used to treat a condition is known as a therapeutic gastroscopy. Read more about why a gastroscopy may be used. The gastroscopy procedure A gastroscopy often takes less than 15 minutes, although it may take longer if it's being used to treat a condition. It's usually carried out as an outpatient procedure, which means you won't have to spend the night in hospital. Before the procedure, your throat will be numbed with a local anaesthetic spray. You can also choose to have a sedative, if you prefer. This means you will still be awake, but will be drowsy and have reduced awareness about what's happening. The doctor carrying out the procedure will place the endoscope in the back of your mouth and ask you to swallow the first part of the tube. It will then be guided down your oesophagus and into your stomach. The procedure shouldn't be painful, but it may be unpleasant or uncomfortable at times.  Read more about how a gastroscopy is performed. What are the risks? A gastroscopy is a very safe procedure, but like all medical procedures it does carry a risk of complications. Possible complications that can occur include: a reaction to the sedative, which can cause problems with your breathing, heart rate and blood pressure internal bleeding tearing of the lining of your oesophagus, stomach or duodenum (perforation) However, serious problems are rare, occurring in less than 1 in every 1,000 cases.

Many hospitals (although not all) have an enhanced recovery programme in place, and it's now seen as standard practice following surgery. Sometimes referred to as rapid or accelerated recovery, enhanced recovery aims to ensure that patients: are as healthy as possible before receiving treatment receive the best possible care during their operation receive the best possible care while recovering Having an operation can be both physically and emotionally stressful. Enhanced recovery programmes try to get you back to full health as quickly as possible. Research has shown the earlier a person gets out of bed and starts walking, eating and drinking after having an operation, the shorter their recovery time will be. The enhanced recovery programme If you need to have an operation, ask whether there's an enhanced recovery programme in place at the hospital you're going to. As part of the enhanced recovery programme, you'll be able to play an active role in your care. You'll be able to choose what's best for you throughout your treatment with help and advice from your GP and healthcare team. Important points to consider before your operation include: eating well \u2013 your body will need energy for repair exercise \u2013 keeping physically active before your operation will help you recover quicker relaxation \u2013 try to relax and not worry about your operation smoking and alcohol \u2013 giving up or cutting down will help speed up your recovery and reduce your risk of developing complications Your GP will give you advice about getting into the best possible shape prior to surgery. They'll also identify and stabilise any health conditions you have that may affect the operation. At this stage, your GP should ensure you understand all the treatment options available to you, so you can make an informed decision about whether to proceed with surgery. Your overall experience should be improved due to high-quality care and, where possible, high-quality services, such as keyhole surgery. Following surgery, you'll also have access to rehabilitation services such as physiotherapy. This will help speed up your recovery and enable you to be discharged from hospital as soon as possible so you can return to normal life. Depending on your operation, you may be able to go home sooner than usually expected. It's therefore important to plan and prepare for your return home before you go into hospital. Read more about having an operation. Who can benefit from enhanced recovery? Enhanced recovery programmes are currently available for the following types of surgery: breast \u2013 such as removal of a breast due to breast cancer colorectal \u2013 such as removal of the rectum due to bowel cancer gynaecological \u2013 such as a hysterectomy (removal of the womb) musculoskeletal \u2013 such as a hip replacement or knee replacement urological \u2013 such as a prostatectomy (removal of the prostate gland) due to prostate cancer Finding out more Speak to your GP if you're considering having planned surgery. They'll advise you about whether enhanced recovery is suitable for you. Not all hospitals offer enhanced recovery programmes, but the number that do is growing all the time.

It's particularly common in men over 50 years of age and isn't usually a serious threat to health. Prostate gland The prostate is a small gland found only in men, located in the pelvis, between the penis and bladder. It's involved in the production of semen. The prostate produces a thick, white fluid that's made into a thinner liquid by a protein called prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The liquid is then mixed with sperm, produced by the testicles, to create semen. If the prostate becomes enlarged, it can place pressure on the bladder and urethra (the tube through which urine passes). This can affect how you pass urine and may cause: difficulty starting urination a frequent need to urinate difficulty fully emptying the bladder In some men, the symptoms are mild and don't require treatment. In others, the symptoms can be very troublesome and have a major impact on a person's quality of life. Read more about the symptoms of benign prostate enlargement. Many men worry that having an enlarged prostate means they have an increased risk of developing prostate cancer. This isn't the case. The risk of prostate cancer is no greater for men with an enlarged prostate than it is for men without an enlarged prostate. What causes benign prostate enlargement? The cause of prostate enlargement is unknown, but most experts agree that it's linked to hormonal changes that occur as a man gets older. Read more about the causes of benign prostate enlargement. How is benign prostate enlargement diagnosed? If your GP suspects that you have an enlarged prostate, you'll be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess your symptoms. Each question has five possible answers that carry a score, and your overall score indicates the severity of your symptoms. Your GP will also want to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms to prostate enlargement.  You may have a number of standard tests, such as urine tests, plus some more specific tests, such as a blood test that measures PSA. Read more about diagnosing benign prostate enlargement. Treating benign prostate enlargement Treatment for an enlarged prostate is determined by the severity of your symptoms. If you have mild to moderate symptoms, you won't receive any immediate medical treatment, but you'll have regular check-ups to carefully monitor your prostate. You'll probably also be advised to make lifestyle changes, such as limiting your caffeine and alcohol intake, and exercising regularly, to see if they improve your symptoms. As well as lifestyle changes, medication is usually recommended to treat moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement. Finasteride and dutasteride are medications that are commonly used. They block the effects of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the prostate gland, which can reduce the size of the prostate and improve associated symptoms. Alpha blockers may also be prescribed. They help to relax your bladder muscles, making it easier to pass urine. Tamsulosin and alfuzosin are two alpha blockers commonly used to treat benign prostate enlargement. Surgery is usually only recommended for moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement that have failed to respond to medication. Read more about treating benign prostate enlargement. Complications of benign prostate enlargement Benign prostate enlargement can sometimes lead to complications such as a urinary tract infection (UTI) or acute urinary retention. Serious complications are rare. Read more about the complications of benign prostate enlargement. How common is benign prostate enlargement? Benign prostate enlargement is a condition associated with ageing and is common in men over 50 years of age. Around 4 out of 10 men (40%) over 50, and 3 out of 4 men (75%) in their 70s have urinary symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate.

Threadworms are a common type of worm infection in the UK, particularly in children under the age of 10.   The worms are white and look like small pieces of thread. You may notice them around your child's bottom or in their poo. They don't always cause symptoms, but people often experience itchiness around their bottom or vagina. It can be worse at night and disturb sleep. Read more about the symptoms of threadworms. When to see your GP If you think you or your child may have threadworms, you can usually treat the infection yourself with medication available at pharmacies without a prescription. You only need to see your GP if you think you have threadworms and you're pregnant or breastfeeding, or if you think your child has threadworms and they're under two years old. In these circumstances, the recommended treatment is usually different. How threadworms are spread Threadworms lay their eggs around an infected person's anus (bottom), usually at night. Along with the eggs, the worm also secretes a mucus that causes itching. If the eggs get stuck on the person's fingertips when they scratch, they can be transferred to their mouth or on to surfaces and clothes. If other people touch an infected surface, they can then transfer the eggs to their mouth. Threadworm eggs can survive for up to two weeks before hatching. If the eggs hatch around the anus, the newborn worms can re-enter the bowel. Eggs that have been swallowed will hatch inside the intestine. After two weeks, the worms reach adult size and begin to reproduce, starting the cycle again. Read more about what causes threadworms. Treating threadworms If you or your child has threadworms, everyone in your household will need to be treated as there's a high risk of the infection spreading. This includes those who don't have any symptoms of an infection. For most people, treatment will involve taking a single dose of a medication called mebendazole to kill the worms. If necessary, another dose can be taken after two weeks. During treatment and for a few weeks afterwards, it's also important to follow strict hygiene measures to avoid spreading the threadworm eggs. This includes regularly vacuuming your house and thoroughly washing your bathroom and kitchen. If you're pregnant or breastfeeding, hygiene measures are usually recommended without medication. This is also often the case for young children.  Read more about treating threadworm infections. Preventing threadworms It's not always possible to prevent a threadworm infection, but you can significantly reduce your risk by always maintaining good hygiene and encouraging children to do the same. Children should wash their hands regularly, particularly after going to the toilet and before mealtimes. Kitchen and bathroom surfaces should be kept clean.   If your child is infected, encouraging them not to scratch the affected area around their anus or vagina will help prevent reinfection and reduce the risk of the infection spreading to others.

These organs are the uterus, vagina, bowel and bladder. Symptoms may include: a sensation of a bulge or something coming down or out of the vagina, which sometimes needs to be pushed back discomfort during sex problems passing urine \u2013 such as slow stream, a feeling of not emptying the bladder fully, needing to urinate more often and leaking a small amount of urine when you cough, sneeze or exercise (stress incontinence) Some women with a pelvic organ prolapse don't have any symptoms and the condition is only discovered during an internal examination for another reason, such as a cervical screening. When to see your GP Pelvic organ prolapse isn't life-threatening, but it can affect your quality of life. See your GP if you have any of the symptoms of a prolapse, or if you notice a lump in or around your vagina. Internal pelvic examination Your doctor will need to carry out an internal pelvic examination. They'll ask you to undress from the waist down and lie back on the examination bed, while they feel for any lumps in your pelvic area. Some women may put off going to their GP if they're embarrassed or worried about what the doctor may find. However, the examination is important, only takes a few minutes and is similar to having a smear test. Further tests If you have bladder symptoms, such as needing to rush to the toilet or leaking when you cough and sneeze, further tests may need to be carried out in hospital. For example, a small tube (catheter) may be inserted into your bladder to examine your bladder function and identify any leakage problems. This test is known as urodynamics. Your doctor will decide if further tests are needed before treating the prolapse. Types of prolapse If pelvic organ prolapse is confirmed, it will usually be staged to indicate how severe it is. Most often, a number system is used, ranging from one to four, with four indicating a severe prolapse. Pelvic organ prolapse can affect the front, top or back of the vagina. The main types of prolapse are: anterior prolapse (cystocele) \u2013 where the bladder bulges into the front wall of the vagina prolapse of the uterus and cervix or top of the vagina \u2013 which can be the result of previous treatment to remove the womb (hysterectomy) posterior wall prolapse (rectocoele or enterocoele) \u2013 when the bowel bulges forward into the back wall of the vagina It's possible to have more than one of these types of prolapse at the same time. Why does prolapse happen? Prolapse is caused by weakening of tissues that support the pelvic organs. Although there's rarely a single cause, the risk of developing pelvic organ prolapse can be increased by: your age \u2013 prolapse is more common as you get older childbirth, particularly if you had a long or difficult labour, or gave birth to multiple babies or a large baby \u2013 up to half of all women who have had children are affected by some degree of prolapse changes caused by the menopause \u2013 such as weakening of tissue and low levels of the hormone oestrogen being overweight, obese or having large fibroids (non-cancerous tumours in or around the womb) or pelvic cysts \u2013 which creates extra pressure in the pelvic area previous pelvic surgery \u2013 such as a hysterectomy or bladder repair repeated heavy lifting and manual work long-term coughing or sneezing \u2013 for example, if you smoke, have a lung condition or allergy excessive straining when going to the toilet because of long-term constipation Certain conditions can also cause the tissues in your body to become weak, making a prolapse more likely, including: joint hypermobility syndrome \u2013 where your joints are very loose Marfan syndrome \u2013 an inherited condition that affects the blood vessels, eyes and skeleton Ehlers-Danlos syndrome \u2013 a group of inherited conditions that affect collagen proteins in the body Can a prolapse be prevented? There are several things you can do to reduce your risk of prolapse, including: doing regular pelvic floor exercises maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if you're overweight eating a high-fibre diet with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, and wholegrain bread and cereal to avoid constipation and straining when going to the toilet avoiding heavy lifting If you smoke, stopping smoking may also help to reduce your risk of a prolapse. How is prolapse treated? Many women with prolapse don't need treatment, as the problem doesn't seriously interfere with their normal activities. Lifestyle changes such as weight loss and pelvic floor exercises are usually recommended in mild cases. If the symptoms require treatment, a prolapse may be treated effectively using a device inserted into the vagina, called a vaginal pessary. This helps to hold the prolapsed organ in place. Surgery may also be an option for some women. This usually involves giving support to the prolapsed organ. In some cases, complete removal of the womb (hysterectomy) is required, especially if the womb has prolapsed out. Most women experience a better quality of life after surgery, but there's a risk of problems remaining or even getting worse.

Contact your GP or NHS 111 immediately, or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if you also have pain in or around your eye or any loss of vision. The information below should give you an idea of what might be wrong, although it shouldn't be used to self-diagnose your condition. It covers possible causes for the following eyelid problems, plus specific advice about what to do. You can find out about: swollen eyelids or eyelid cysts   itchy, flaky or sticky eyelids  lumps on or around the eyelids  hooded or droopy upper eyelids  rolling outwards of the lower eyelids (ectropion)  rolling inwards of the eyelids (entropion)  yellow plaques on the eyelids  excessive blinking or uncontrollable closure of the eyelids  Swollen eyelid or eyelid cyst It's quite common for the upper or lower eyelid to become swollen because of a meibomian cyst (also called a chalazion). This occurs when the glands in the eyelid become blocked. These cysts vary in size, from barely visible to the size of a grape. They usually take weeks to develop. They're not usually painful, but can become red and painful if infected. The cysts can come and go by themselves, although they may take a few months to get better. You can help them heal by holding a clean flannel warmed in hot water to the closed eye for five minutes, and repeating this three to four times a day for up to four weeks. Speak to your GP if you have a cyst that doesn't clear up after a month. They can refer you to have it drained through a small incision (cut). This is a simple procedure carried out under local anaesthetic (your eye area will be numbed). It takes just a few minutes and rarely leaves a scar. Also see your GP if the cyst becomes infected because you may need to take antibiotics to prevent a deep lid infection (cellulitis). Another common cause of a swelling on the eyelid is a stye. A stye is a minor infection of the base of an eyelash that usually clears up on its own in a week or two. Holding a warm flannel to it regularly may help it heal faster. Read more about treating styes. Other causes of lid swelling include an allergic reaction and shingles on the face and eye (usually with a rash), but these are less common. Itchy, flaky or sticky eyelids Itchy and flaky eyelids are usually caused by an inflamed eyelid edge (blepharitis) or dry eye. Your eyelids may also stick together and be difficult to open, particularly when you wake up. These conditions can be irritating, but are rarely serious. You can reduce the irritation by keeping the eyelids clean and using artificial tears if your eyes are dry. Read about treating blepharitis and treating dry eyes. Contact dermatitis is another possible cause of itchy or flaky eyelids. This is a type of eczema triggered when the skin comes into contact with something you are irritated by or allergic to, such as make-up. The condition usually clears up after you stop using the substance your skin is reacting to. Sticky eyelids along with red and watering eyes can be caused by conjunctivitis, which is when an infection, allergy or irritant causes the front of the eye to become inflamed. This can get better on its own, although your GP may be able to prescribe medication to treat the underlying cause. Read more about treating conjunctivitis. Lumps on or around the eyelids Just like anywhere else on the skin, lumps can occur on or around the eyelids. Many lumps are simple cysts or styes (see above). However, occasionally a lump can be a sign of a more serious condition such as skin cancer and may need to be removed. See your GP if you're worried about a lump on or around your eyelids. Most skin cancers are basal cell carcinomas, which very rarely spread to other parts of the body. These often appear as a red or pink lump containing small blood vessels, although they can be pearly-white or \"waxy\" looking. Sometimes they may bleed. Less commonly, the lump may be a squamous cell carcinoma, which is more serious as there\u2019s a small risk it could spread to other parts of the body. These usually look like an ulcer with a red base and a scaly and crusted surface. You may also lose eyelashes where the lump is growing. In rare cases, the lump could be a sign of a very serious type of skin cancer called melanoma that can spread to other parts of the body and can be very dangerous. A lump is more likely to be melanoma if it's an irregular shape, dark or changing in colour, and getting a lot bigger over time. Hooded or droopy upper eyelids As you get older, it's quite common to have excess skin above the upper eyelids that can overhang and block your vision. This is called dermatochalasis. If it affects your vision, surgery may be considered to remove the excess skin (blepharoplasty). However, this operation isn\u2019t routinely funded on the NHS so your doctor would need to submit a funding request for this to be considered. If the edge of your upper lid droops down over your eye, it's called ptosis. This is usually age-related and develops slowly. Surgery may be needed if the edge of the lid droops so much your vision is affected. In rare cases, ptosis isn't related to age and may be caused by serious conditions such as myasthenia gravis or a brain tumour. In these cases, it's likely there would be other symptoms too. See your GP immediately if ptosis comes on rapidly, over days or weeks, or if it's associated with other symptoms, such as a headache, loss of vision or a change in the size of the pupil (the black dot at the centre of the eye). Lower eyelid that rolls outwards (ectropion)  As you get older, one or both lower eyelids can sometimes droop away from the eye and turn outwards. This is known as an ectropion. The drooping eyelid can disrupt the normal production of tears, which can cause your eye to become dry, red and irritated. Treatment may not be needed in mild cases, although drops or ointment may help make your eye more comfortable. Sometimes a minor operation is needed to correct the position of the eyelid. Read more about treating ectropion. Eyelids that roll inwards (entropion) Entropion is where the eyelid rolls inwards. It usually affects the lower lids, but it can also affect the upper lids. Like ectropion, this is often age-related. Entropion usually causes an uncomfortable watery eye because the lashes irritate the front of the eye (cornea). If this is mild, using eyedrops may be enough to protect the eye and keep you comfortable. Severe entropion can be painful and cause vision loss by damaging the cornea. Occasionally, a corneal ulcer can form and become infected. Surgery may be needed to correct entropion if it's posing a risk to the health of your eye or is causing considerable discomfort. This is carried out under local anaesthetic. If you have entropion, you should discuss your treatment options with your GP. Consult your GP immediately if your eye becomes painful and red and your vision is affected. Yellow plaques on the eyelids Flat yellow patches (plaques) over the upper or lower eyelids are called xanthelasma.  Although these plaques are harmless, they indicate you have high cholesterol. See your GP because you may be at risk of developing cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks and strokes. Making changes to your diet and taking medication may be recommended to reduce your cholesterol level and reduce your risk of serious problems in the future, although these may not improve the plaques. If you're bothered by the appearance of the plaques, it may be possible for them to be surgically removed or treated with a laser. However, this isn't normally funded on the NHS. Excessive blinking or uncontrollable closure of the eyelids It's quite common and normal for the eyelid to flicker or twitch occasionally, particularly when you're tired. It's more unusual to have repeated spasms of excessive blinking and involuntary closure of one or both eyes. This is a type of dystonia (a movement disorder that causes muscle spasms and contractions) known as blepharospasm. Each spasm can last for a few seconds to a few minutes. The exact cause of blepharospasm is unknown. However, the blinking and closure can be triggered by bright light, stress or tiredness. Severe blepharospasm can be very disabling and embarrassing. However, an effective treatment is available. It involves having small injections of botulinum toxin (such as Botox) into the face to relax the muscles controlling the eyelids. In some cases, your GP may consider referring you to a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nerves) for further investigation.

The problem usually resolves in time. Bedwetting is common in young children but it gets less common as a child gets older. In the UK, it's estimated that about: 1 in 12 children wet the bed regularly at four and a half years old (regularly is defined as at least twice a week) 1 in 40 children wet the bed regularly at seven and a half years old 1 in 65 children wet the bed regularly at nine and a half years old About 1 in 100 people continue to wet the bed into adulthood. Bedwetting is slightly more common in boys than girls. When to see your GP Bedwetting is only really a problem if it begins to bother the children or parents. Only rarely will this be considered a problem in children under 5 years old. Many families first seek treatment when the bedwetting affects a child's social life (for example, preventing sleepovers). Medical treatments aren't usually recommended for children under five (although exceptions can be made if a child finds bedwetting particularly upsetting). If your child frequently wets the bed and finds it upsetting, speak to your GP for advice. Read more about the symptoms of bedwetting. Why does my child wet the bed?  There's usually no obvious reason why children wet the bed and it's not your child's fault. In many cases, the problem runs in families. Bedwetting could be caused by your child: producing more urine than their bladder can cope with having an overactive bladder, meaning it can only hold a small amount of urine being a very deep sleeper so they don't react to the signals telling their brain their bladder is full Constipation is frequently associated with bedwetting, especially in children who don't wet themselves every night. In these cases, bedwetting may happen during the night when the child has not had a poo during the day. Sometimes, treating constipation is all that's needed to treat bedwetting. Untreated constipation makes any treatment of bedwetting much harder. Occasionally, bedwetting can be triggered by emotional distress, such as being bullied or moving to a new school. In rare cases, bedwetting may be the symptom of an underlying health condition, such as type 1 diabetes. Read more about the causes of bedwetting and diagnosing bedwetting. Treating bedwetting The recommended plan is usually to try a few measures yourself first, such as limiting the amount of liquid your child drinks in the evening, and making sure they go to the toilet before going to sleep. Reassuring your child that everything is okay is also important. Don't tell them off or punish them for wetting the bed as this won't help and could make the problem worse. It's important for them to know they're not alone, and it will get better. If these measures alone don't help, a bedwetting alarm is often recommended. These are moisture-sensitive pads a child wears on their night clothes. An alarm sounds if the child begins to pee. Over time, the alarm should help train a child to wake once their bladder is full. If an alarm doesn't work or is unsuitable, medication called desmopressin or oxybutinin can be used.  Most children respond well to treatment, although bedwetting sometimes returns temporarily. Read more about treating bedwetting. ERIC Education and Resources for Improving Childhood Continence (ERIC) is a UK-based charity for people affected by bedwetting. The charity\u2019s website provides useful information and advice for both children and parents. ERIC also has a telephone helpline \u2013 0845 370 8008, open weekdays from 10am to 4pm. Bedwetting in adults About 1 in 100 people continue to wet the bed into adulthood, and some people only begin to wet the bed as an adult. This usually requires referral to a specialist such as an urologist (a specialist in treating conditions that affect the urinary system) or an incontinence adviser.

Inflammation is your immune system's response to tissue that has become injured or infected. Damaged cells release chemicals that cause blood vessels to leak fluid into the tissues, causing tissue swelling. If there's an infection, this helps isolate the invading germ.  In vasculitis, your immune system attacks the blood vessels by mistake. The trigger may be an infection, a medicine or another medical condition. Sometimes, however, the cause isn't clear. It leads to swollen blood vessel walls and narrowed blood vessels. Blood flow to tissues and organs is reduced or blocked. If the blood vessel wall becomes weak, bleeding can occur. Any blood vessel can become inflamed like this, from large arteries (\"arteritis\") to small blood vessels, in any place in the body. The larger the blood vessels affected, the more damage there may be. All these variables mean there are many possible types of vasculitis, each with different symptoms and potential complications. These are covered below (ordered by size of the affected blood vessels): Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) Polymyalgia rheumatica  Takayasu arteritis  Polyarteritis nodosa  Kawasaki disease Granulomatosis with polyangiitis  Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis  Microscopic polyangiitis Henoch\u2013Schönlein purpura  Less common types  These types of vasculitis are briefly explained below, with links taking you to more detailed information. Giant cell arteritis Giant cell arteritis is an age-related condition in which medium and large arteries, usually in the head and neck, become inflamed. It's sometimes called \"temporal arteritis\", because the arteries around the temples are often affected. Symptoms of giant cell arteritis include: aching and soreness around the temples jaw muscle pain while eating vision loss It tends to only affect adults over the age of 50, and the cause is unclear. The main treatment is steroid medication (usually prednisolone), which is given promptly when the diagnosis is suspected.  Read more about giant cell arteritis. Polymyalgia rheumatica  Polymyalgia rheumatica is another age-related condition closely related to giant cell arteritis. It causes pain, stiffness and inflammation in the muscles around the shoulders, neck and hips. It may also cause more general symptoms, such as a fever, extreme tiredness, loss of appetite, weight loss and depression. The condition is two to three times more common in women than men, and most people diagnosed with it are over 70 years old. The cause is unclear.  The main treatment is usually prednisolone (a steroid medication), which is usually used in lower doses than for giant cell arteritis.  Read more about polymyalgia rheumatica. Takayasu arteritis Takayasu arteritis is rare in the UK. The main artery from the heart is affected, along with the major arteries branching off this. These arteries gradually narrow over time, which reduces the blood supply to the limbs and other parts of the body. Treatment is usually steroid medication. Read information about Takayasu arteritis from Vasculitis UK. Polyarteritis nodosa Polyarteritis nodosa is a rare form of vasculitis, in which the medium or smaller arteries become damaged and inflamed. It particularly affects the arteries supplying the gut, kidneys and nerves. Sometimes, only part of the artery wall is affected, which becomes weak and may bulge, forming an aneurysm. If this leaks or ruptures, it can cause serious internal bleeding. Polyarteritis nodosa can also affect the whole wall of the artery at a particular point, and cause a blockage. The condition is potentially very serious. Typical symptoms are feeling unwell with fever, skin rashes, tummy aches, nerve damage and weight loss. Polyarteritis nodosa can sometimes be triggered by an infection, but the exact cause is uncertain. Read information about polyarteritis nodosa from the Great Ormond Street Hospital website. Kawasaki disease Kawasaki disease is a rare condition that affects small and medium arteries in children under the age of five.  The characteristic symptoms of Kawasaki disease are a high temperature that lasts for more than five days, with a rash, swollen glands in the neck, red fingers or toes, red eyes and redness of the lips, tongue or mouth. Kawasaki disease can affect the coronary arteries (the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart), so some children with Kawasaki disease experience heart complications. The trigger is thought to be an infection, although the exact cause is not fully understood. The affected child will usually need to be managed in hospital, because of the risk of complications \u2013 they will need to be carefully assessed for heart problems and treated with immunoglobulins and aspirin. Read more about Kawasaki disease. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis)  Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is an uncommon disorder that mainly affects the blood vessels in the nose, sinuses, ears, lungs and kidneys. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fever, night sweats, sinusitis, nosebleeds and crusting of the nose, shortness of breath, coughing up blood and kidney impairment. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a serious condition that can be fatal if left untreated, because it can lead to tissue damage and organ failure. High doses of drugs are needed to dampen down the immune system and bring the inflammation under control. Typically, it is treated with steroid medications (prednisone) and cyclophosphamide \u2013 a cancer drug that suppresses the immune system. Read more about granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg\u2013Strauss syndrome) Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a type of vasculitis that typically causes allergic sinusitis and asthma to develop in adults. It mainly affects adults aged 30-45. Many of the other symptoms are general and include fever, muscle and joint aches, tiredness, loss of appetite and weight loss. The condition can also affect the nerves, causing weakness, pins and needles or numbness, and it sometimes damages the heart muscle. Read information about Eosinophilic granulomatosis from Vasculitis UK. Microscopic polyangiitis Microscopic polyangiitis is another rare and potentially serious long-term vasculitis. Inflammation of the blood vessel walls may affect any organ, but particularly the lungs, kidneys and nervous system. It can lead to raised blood pressure, kidney impairment, anaemia, breathlessness and coughing up blood.  Read information from the Oxford University Hospitals NHS website about microscopic polyangiitis. Henoch\u2013Schönlein purpura (HSP) Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a rare condition, usually seen in children, which results in a skin rash and joint and tummy pain. It can follow a recent infection. Inflammation of the blood vessels can cause the small surface blood vessels to bleed into the skin, which results in a characteristic rash (purpura). Joint pain is also common. HSP can also affect blood vessels in the bowel and the kidneys, and can cause tummy pain and visible blood in the urine or stools. HSP usually gets better without treatment and is not usually serious. Read more about Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Less common types of vasculitis  Behçet's disease \u2013 typically results in mouth ulcers and genital ulcers, and is more common in people from Greece, Turkey, the Middle East, China and Japan Buerger's disease (links to the Vasculitis UK website) \u2013 affects vessels in the legs and arms, leading to reduced blood flow to the hands and feet Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (links to the Vasculitis UK website) \u2013 inflammation of the brain's blood vessels Cogan's Syndrome (links to the Vasculitis UK website) \u2013 inflammation of the inner ears and eyes Cryoglobulin-associated vasculitis (links to the Vasculitis UK website) \u2013 associated with cryoglobulins (proteins in the blood that stick together in the cold); can cause a rash on the lower limbs, joint pain or arthritis, nerve damage, abdominal pain and kidney failure Hypersensitivity vasculitis (links to Vasculitis UK website) \u2013 most commonly caused by sensitivity to a drug such as penicillin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or the contraceptive pill, and results in a skin rash  Vasculitis caused by rheumatoid arthritis (links to the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society) The links take you to more information on these rarer types of vasculitis.

It's clinically known as lateral epicondylitis. It often occurs after strenuous overuse of the muscles and tendons of the forearm, near the elbow joint. You may notice pain: on the outside of your upper forearm, just below the bend of your elbow when lifting or bending your arm when gripping small objects, such as a pen when twisting your forearm, such as turning a door handle or opening a jar You may also find it difficult to fully extend your arm. Read more about the symptoms of tennis elbow. What causes tennis elbow? The elbow joint is surrounded by muscles that move your elbow, wrist and fingers. The tendons in your elbow join the bones and muscles together, and control the muscles of your forearm. Tennis elbow is usually caused by overusing the muscles attached to your elbow and used to straighten your wrist. If the muscles and tendons are strained, tiny tears and inflammation can develop near the bony lump (the lateral epicondyle) on the outside of your elbow. As the name suggests, tennis elbow is sometimes caused by playing tennis. However, it is often caused by other activities that place repeated stress on the elbow joint, such as decorating or playing the violin. Pain that occurs on the inner side of the elbow is often known as golfer's elbow. Read more about the causes of tennis elbow. When to see your GP If your elbow pain is caused by a strenuous or repetitive activity, you should avoid the activity until your symptoms improve.  Visit your GP if the pain in your elbow persists, despite resting it for a few days. They will check for swelling and tenderness, and carry out some simple tests, such as asking you to extend your fingers and flex your wrist with your elbow extended. Further tests, such as an ultrasound scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will only be needed if it is thought that your pain is being caused by nerve damage. Treating tennis elbow Tennis elbow is a self-limiting condition, which means it will eventually get better without treatment. However, there are treatments that can be used to improve your symptoms and speed up your recovery. It's important that you rest your injured arm and stop doing the activity that's causing the problem. Holding a cold compress, such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel, against your elbow for a few minutes several times a day can help ease the pain. Taking painkillers, such as paracetamol, may help reduce mild pain caused by tennis elbow. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can also be used to help reduce inflammation. Physiotherapy may be recommended in more severe and persistent cases. Massaging and manipulating the affected area may help relieve the pain and stiffness, and improve the range of movement in your arm. Surgery may be used as a last resort to remove the damaged part of the tendon. Most cases of tennis elbow last between six months and two years. However, in about nine out of 10 cases, a full recovery is made within a year. Read more about how tennis elbow is treated. Preventing tennis elbow It's not always easy to avoid getting tennis elbow, although not putting too much stress on the muscles and tendons surrounding your elbow will help prevent the condition getting worse. If your tennis elbow is caused by an activity that involves placing repeated strain on your elbow joint, such as tennis, changing your technique may alleviate the problem. Read more advice about preventing tennis elbow.  Tennis elbow is pain on the outside of the elbow  Who is affected by tennis elbow? Tennis elbow is a common musculoskeletal condition. It's estimated that as many as one in three people have tennis elbow at any given time. Each year in the UK, about five in every 1,000 people go to see their GP about tennis elbow. The condition usually affects adults and is more common in people who are 40-60 years of age. Men and women are equally affected.

There's some debate over the correct term to use for the condition, but these pages will refer to the condition as CFS. CFS is a serious condition that can cause long-term illness and disability, but many people \u2013 particularly children and young people \u2013 improve over time. Who is affected? It's estimated around 250,000 people in the UK have CFS. Anyone can get the condition, although it's more common in women than men. It usually develops when people are in their early 20s to mid-40s. Children can also be affected, usually between the ages of 13 and 15.  How it affects quality of life Most cases of CFS are mild or moderate, but up to one in four people with CFS have severe symptoms. These are defined as follows:  mild \u2013 you're able to care for yourself, but may need days off work to rest moderate \u2013 you may have reduced mobility, and your symptoms can vary; you may also have disturbed sleep patterns and need to sleep in the afternoon severe \u2013 you're able to carry out minimal daily tasks, such as brushing your teeth, but have significantly reduced mobility, and may also have difficulty concentrating Read more about the symptoms of CFS. Why it happens It's not known exactly what causes CFS. Various theories have been suggested, including: a viral or bacterial infection problems with the immune system an imbalance of hormones psychiatric problems, such as stress and emotional trauma Some people are thought to be more susceptible to the condition because of their genes, as the condition is more common in some families. More research is needed to confirm exactly what causes the condition. Read more about the causes of CFS. How it is diagnosed There are specific guidelines issued by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) about the diagnosis and management of CFS. NICE says a diagnosis of CFS should be considered if you meet specific criteria regarding your fatigue \u2013 for example, it can't be explained by other conditions \u2013 and if you also have other symptoms, such as sleeping problems or problems thinking and concentrating. The diagnosis can then be confirmed if these symptoms are experienced for several months. Read more about diagnosing CFS. How it is treated Treatment for CFS may be able to reduce the symptoms. Everyone with CFS responds to treatment differently, so your treatment plan will be tailored to you. Some of the main treatments include: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) a structured exercise programme called graded exercise therapy medication to control pain, nausea and sleeping problems Most people with CFS improve over time, although some people don't make a full recovery. It's also likely there will be periods when symptoms get better or worse. Children and young people with CFS are more likely to recover fully. Read more about treating CFS. Different terms for the condition chronic fatigue syndrome \u2013 often used and preferred by doctors as there's little evidence of brain and spinal cord inflammation, which the term ME suggests; ME is also thought to be too specific to cover all the symptoms of the condition myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) \u2013 preferred by those who feel CFS is not specific enough and doesn't reflect the severity and different types of fatigue, and implies that fatigue is the only symptom (myalgic encephalopathy is sometimes also used) systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID) \u2013 a new term suggested in a 2015 report by the US Institute of Medicine, which implies that the condition affects many systems in the body (systemic); the word \"disease\" highlights the serious nature of the condition in some people Page last reviewed: 25\/02\/2015 Next review due: 25\/02\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Outbreaks of typhus tend to occur in developing countries and areas where there is poverty, homelessness, close human contact and poor sanitation. The Rickettsia bacteria that cause typhus are carried by body lice, ticks, mites and fleas. This page covers the main types: epidemic typhus (the most serious form) \u2013 this type occurs in Africa, South America and Asia, and is transmitted by body lice  endemic typhus (the milder form of the disease) \u2013 it occurs throughout the world and is transmitted by ticks, mites and fleas  scrub typhus (also called Tsutsugamushi fever) \u2013 this type is caught from mites infected with Orientia tsutsugamushi bacteria, which live in heavy scrub vegetation in parts of rural southeast Asia, Oceania and northern Australia Typhus is generally not a problem in the UK. But you may become infected abroad if you catch Rickettsia-infected lice from infested people or bedding (in budget accommodation or on a sleeper train, for example), or if you are bitten by a Rickettsia-infected tick, mite or flea. How do you catch epidemic typhus? Epidemic typhus is passed from human to human by body lice. These are not the same as head lice or pubic lice, which are a nuisance, but don't transmit disease. The body lice become infected with Rickettsia prowazekii bacteria when they feed on the blood of an infected person. If you catch these infected body lice (for example, by using a louse-infested blanket), their infected faeces will be deposited on your skin as they feed on your blood. You only need to scratch a bite to rub the contaminated lice faeces into the tiny wound on your skin to become infected. Less commonly, you can catch epidemic typhus by breathing infected dried body louse faeces in airborne dust. How do you catch endemic typhus? Endemic typhus is transmitted by ticks, mites and fleas infected with Rickettsia bacteria. These animal carriers of typhus may live in thick scrub vegetation or on small mammals or rodents, such as rats. What are the symptoms? The symptoms of epidemic, endemic and scrub typhus are similar. Typically, someone with typhus will start to feel unwell 10 to 14 days after becoming infected. A sudden, severe headache is often the first symptom. Other symptoms may include: a fever \u2013 where body temperature rises above 38.9C\/102F for up to two weeks a pink or red rash that starts on the chest and spreads to the arms, hands, legs and feet \u2013 but not the face, palms and soles nausea and vomiting abdominal pain and diarrhoea joint and muscle pain \u2013 backache is common a cough In addition, the person with typhus is often mentally dazed or delirious \u2013 the word \"typhus\" comes from the Greek word meaning \"a cloud\". They may become deaf or have ringing in the ears (tinnitus). These symptoms usually last around two weeks. How is typhus diagnosed and treated? Anyone who is unwell shortly after visiting a high-risk country should see their GP, who will listen to your symptoms and take note of the countries you have recently visited. You will also be physically examined and have a number of tests \u2013 for example, a blood test to rule out other diseases such as malaria. If there is a rash, the GP may take a skin biopsy (a small sample of skin from the rash) and send this to a laboratory for testing. A diagnosis of typhus is confirmed if the Rickettsia bacteria are identified in a blood or skin sample. But the patient may be started on antibiotics even before the results come back if typhus is suspected. If treated promptly with either doxycycline or tetracycline, most patients improve dramatically within 48 hours of treatment and make a full recovery. If the patient has epidemic typhus (the more serious type), they may need to take antibiotics through a drip in their arm (intravenously) while they are in hospital. What are the possible complications? If typhus is not diagnosed and treated promptly, there is a risk of developing complications, including: long-term hearing loss or tinnitus low blood pressure organ damage and kidney failure secondary bacterial infection, such as pneumonia seizures confusion drowsiness gangrene The patient may need to have hospital follow-up for some months after recovering from an attack of typhus to receive treatment for these long-term problems. Brill-Zinsser disease Some people who previously had epidemic typhus will develop a milder form of the disease years later called Brill-Zinsser disease. This tends to happen when the bacteria were not properly killed off the first time and lie dormant (inactive) in the body. The bacteria then reactivate at a later date when the person's immune system is weak. Brill-Zinsser disease will need treating again with antibiotics. Can typhus be prevented? There's currently no licensed vaccine for typhus. The best way to avoid becoming infected with typhus is to avoid areas or crowds where louse-borne typhus is a problem, and take care to avoid contact with ticks, mites and fleas. Wash and change your clothes regularly, and don't use any bedding or clothing that could be infested with body lice. If you're about to travel abroad to an area where typhus is a problem, talk to your doctor about taking weekly doses of doxycycline to prevent infection. This is especially effective against scrub typhus.

In people with EB, any trauma or friction to the skin can cause painful blisters. Types of epidermolysis bullosa There are three main types of EB, which are described below. The condition is classified according to where in the various layers of skin the blistering takes place. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), where blistering occurs in the upper layer of the skin (the epidermis). This is the most common type of EB, accounting for 70% of cases, and tends to be milder than the other types. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), where blistering occurs below the basement membrane zone in the upper part of the dermis. DEB accounts for around 25% of cases. Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB), where blistering occurs at the junction between the epidermis and the dermis (lower layer of the skin) in a layer of skin known as the basement membrane zone. JEB accounts for around 5% of cases and is usually considered the most severe type of EB. There are many variants of these main types of EB, each with slightly different symptoms. So far, researchers have classified 27 variants of the condition and more may be identified in the future. Read more about the symptoms of epidermolysis bullosa. In most cases, symptoms of EB are obvious from birth or soon after. If it's suspected your child has the condition, they'll be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist). The specialist will carry out tests to determine the type of EB and help to come up with a treatment plan. Read more about diagnosing epidermolysis bullosa. Why does EB happen? EB is caused by faulty genes. In most cases these are inherited from one or both parents but sometimes the fault occurs spontaneously. In some cases, one or both parents will have the condition. However, there are many cases when neither parent has EB, but their child does. This happens when both parents are 'carriers' of the faulty genes. If you or your partner is known to be a carrier of a mutated gene associated with EB, and there's a risk of your child developing a severe form of the condition, it's possible to test an unborn baby at about 11 weeks into pregnancy. Read more about the causes of epidermolysis bullosa. Who is affected? EB is a rare condition. It's estimated one in every 17,000 children born in the UK will have EB. In the UK, there are currently an estimated 5,000 people living with it. EB affects both sexes equally. How is EB treated? There's currently no cure for EB, so treatment aims to relieve symptoms and prevent complications developing, such as infection. A team of medical specialists will help you decide what treatment is best for your child and offer advice about living with the condition. Most treatments can be done at home, such as popping blisters with a sterile needle, applying protective dressings and avoiding things that make the condition worse. Medicines can be used to treat infection or to reduce pain. Surgery can be used if EB causes narrowing of the foodpipe or problems with the hands. Read more about treating epidermolysis bullosa. Outlook The outlook for EB can vary widely depending on the type and variant of EB a child has. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) carries a low risk of causing serious complications. However, it can often be a frustrating condition to live with, as it can interfere with daily activities. Some cases of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) are mild and cause no serious complications, while others are severe and may affect general health or possibly lead to skin cancer in later life. The outlook for a very rare type of junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB-severe generalised) is poor. Around 40% of children with the condition will not survive the first year of life, and most will not survive more than five years. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is an acquired form of epidermolysis bullosa (EB), with similar symptoms. Like EB, EBA causes the skin to blister easily. It can also affect the mouth, throat and digestive tract. However, EBA is not inherited. EBA is an autoimmune disease which doesn't usually appear until later life. It's not known exactly what causes it. EBA is more common in people over the age of 40, but overall it's a very rare condition. Information about you If you or your child has EB, your clinical team will pass information about you\/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

When this tube become inflamed (painful, warm and swollen), it's known as epididymitis. The cause of epididymitis is usually an infection, and antibiotics may be needed. It might take several weeks for the symptoms to get better. If the testicles are also inflamed, it's known as epididymo-orchitis.   This page offers more information about epididymitis, covering: what are the symptoms?  why did I develop it?  how is it diagnosed?  how is it treated?  What are the symptoms of epididymitis? Epididymitis causes sudden pain in one or both of the testicles. The scrotum will feel tender, warm and swollen.  There may be a build-up of fluid around the testicle (a hydrocele), which will feel like a lump or swelling. Sometimes there may also be a discharge from the tip of the penis. This means the cause may be a sexually transmitted infection (see below). Sometimes, it becomes difficult to pee, or you need to pee more often. This means the cause may be a urinary tract infection. See your GP if you think you have these symptoms, so the cause can be properly diagnosed and treated. Testicular torsion It can be difficult to tell whether testicular pain is the result of epididymo-orchitis, or a much more serious condition called testicular torsion.  Testicular torsion means that the spermatic cord (cord that supplies the testicles with blood) has become severely twisted. It needs very urgent treatment, so if you have any doubt about the cause of your testicular pain, make sure you're seen by a doctor as soon as possible. Why did I develop it? Epididymitis is usually caused by: a sexually transmitted infection such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea, or a urinary tract infection (UTI) UTIs are much less common in men than women. In men, a UTI may be caused by an enlarged prostate gland pressing on the bladder, the insertion of a catheter into the penis, or recent surgery to the groin, prostate gland or bladder. Men of any age can develop epididymitis. More unusual causes More unusually, epididymitis is caused by: mumps  tuberculosis taking high daily doses of the medication amiodarone (normally taken for a heart rhythm disorder)  urine flowing back into the epididymis after heavy lifting or straining, or associated with an enlarged prostate gland a groin injury Behçet's disease  When the cause isn't known, it's termed idiopathic epididymitis. How is it diagnosed? Your GP will probably need to carry out a physical examination of your groin, to check for signs of inflammation and infection. To find out the underlying cause of the epididymitis, you may need to have: a test for gonorrhea and chlamydia, where a narrow swab is inserted into your penis to collect a sample of discharge urine and blood tests a rectal examination, where your GP inserts a gloved finger into your bottom, to see if there's a problem with your prostate gland an ultrasound, to rule out testicular torsion (a medical emergency where the testicle becomes twisted) How is it treated? Rest and painkillers If you've been diagnosed with epididymitis, you'll need to rest and take over-the-counter painkillers to manage any pain. Ibuprofen may be recommended, as this also eases the inflammation. It may help to: lie in bed with your scrotum raised wear a scrotal support hold a cold pack to your groin (try a pack of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) Antibiotics If the underlying cause is an infection, you may need antibiotics. Read about the: treatment of gonorrhoea treatment of chlamydia treatment of a urinary tract infection If you have gonorrhoea or chlamydia, you'll need to avoid having sex until you and your partner have completed treatment for this.

Areas that can be numbed by an epidural include the: chest abdomen pelvic area legs How an epidural works Anaesthetic medicine is injected into an area of the spine known as the epidural space. The anaesthetic works by numbing pain nerves as they enter the spinal cord. The extent of the numbness will depend on the type of drug used, and the amount injected. Once the medication has worn off, feeling in the affected areas will return. Read more about how an epidural is performed. When is an epidural used? An epidural can be used to provide pain relief in situations including: during childbirth during an operation, instead of a general anaesthetic after surgery that has been carried out under general anaesthetic Read more about why an epidural is used. This topic focuses mainly on having an epidural during labour and childbirth. Safety Epidurals have been routinely used for many years and are widely accepted as an effective method of pain relief after surgery, and during labour and childbirth. However, as with many medical procedures, there are some associated risks that, although small, you should be aware of before deciding whether to have an epidural. Two possible risks include: puncture of the dura \u2013 the toughest, outer layer surrounding the spinal cord and brain; the risk of the dura being punctured is about one in 100 nerve damage \u2013 which occurs only very rarely Read more about the side effects and complications of an epidural.

In most cases, it's caused by infection. The epiglottis is a flap of tissue that sits beneath the tongue at the back of the throat. Its main function is to close over the windpipe (trachea) while you're eating, to prevent food entering your airways. Symptoms of epiglottitis The symptoms of epiglottitis usually develop quickly and get rapidly worse, although they can develop over a few days in older children and adults. Symptoms include: a severe sore throat difficulty and pain when swallowing difficulty breathing, which may improve when leaning forwards breathing that sounds abnormal and high-pitched (stridor) a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above irritability and restlessness muffled or hoarse voice drooling The main symptoms of epiglottitis in young children are breathing difficulties, stridor and a hoarse voice. In adults and older children, the main signs are a severe sore throat, swallowing difficulties and drooling. When to seek medical advice Epiglottitis is regarded as a medical emergency, as a swollen epiglottis can restrict the oxygen supply to your lungs. Dial 999 to ask for an ambulance if you think you or your child has epiglottitis. While waiting for an ambulance, you shouldn't attempt to examine your child's throat, place anything inside their mouth or lay them on their back, because this may make their symptoms worse. It's important to keep them calm and to try not to cause panic or distress. Epiglottitis can be fatal if the throat becomes completely blocked. However, with appropriate treatment, most people make a full recovery. Treating epiglottitis Epiglottitis is treated in hospital. The first thing the medical team will do is secure the person's airways, to make sure they can breathe properly. Securing the airways An oxygen mask will be given to deliver highly concentrated oxygen to the person's lungs. If this doesn't work, a tube will be placed in the patient's mouth and pushed past their epiglottis into the windpipe. The tube will be connected to an oxygen supply. In severe cases, where there's an urgent need to secure the airways, a small cut may be made in the neck, at the front of the windpipe, so a tube can be inserted. The tube is then connected to an oxygen supply. This procedure is called a tracheostomy and it allows oxygen to enter the lungs while bypassing the epiglottis. An emergency tracheostomy can be carried out using local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic. Once the airways have been secured and the person is able to breathe unrestricted, a more comfortable and convenient way of assisting breathing may be found. This is usually achieved by threading a tube through the nose and into the windpipe. Fluids will be supplied through a drip into one of your veins, until the person is able to swallow. Once this has been achieved and the situation is thought to be safe, some tests may be carried out, such as: a fibre-optic laryngoscopy \u2013 a flexible tube with a camera attached to one end (laryngoscope) is used to examine the throat a throat swab \u2013 to test for any bacteria or viruses blood tests \u2013 to check the number of white blood cells (a high number indicates there may an infection) and to identify any traces of bacteria or viruses in the blood an X-ray or a computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 sometimes used to check the level of swelling The underlying infection will then be treated with a course of antibiotics, and most people with epiglottitis are well enough to leave hospital after five to seven days. With prompt treatment, most people recover from epiglottitis after about a week and are usually well enough to leave hospital after five to seven days. Why it happens Epiglottitis is usually caused by an infection with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria. As well as epiglottitis, Hib can cause a number of serious infections, such as pneumonia and meningitis. It spreads in the same way as the cold or flu virus; the bacteria are in the tiny droplets of saliva and mucus propelled into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You catch the infection by breathing in these droplets or, if the droplets have landed on a surface or object, by touching this surface and then touching your face or mouth. Less common causes of epiglottitis include: other bacterial infections \u2013 such as streptococcus pneumoniae (a common cause of pneumonia) fungal infections \u2013 people with a weakened immune system are most at risk from these types of infection viral infections \u2013 such as the varicella zoster virus (the virus responsible for chickenpox) and the herpes simplex virus (the virus responsible for cold sores) trauma to the throat \u2013 such as a blow to the throat, or burning the throat by drinking very hot liquids smoking \u2013 particularly illegal drugs, such as cannabis or crack cocaine Hib vaccination The most effective way to prevent your child getting epiglottitis is to make sure their vaccinations are up to date. Children are particularly vulnerable to a Hib infection, because they have an underdeveloped immune system. Children should receive their Hib as part of the 5 in 1 DTaP\/IPV\/Hib vaccine, which also protects against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and polio. Children should receive three doses of the vaccine: one at two months, one when they are three months and one when they are four months old. This is followed by an additional Hib\/Men C \"booster\" vaccine at 12 months. As children from developing countries may not have received the vaccination, children who have immigrated to the UK should take part in the UK immunisation programme. Contact your GP if you are not sure whether your child\u2019s vaccinations are up to date. Read more about the childhood vaccination schedule. Who is affected Because of the success of the Hib vaccination programme, epiglottitis is rare in the UK, and most cases now occur in adults. Deaths from epiglottitis are also rare, occurring in less than 1 in 100 cases. During 2013-14, around 600 people were admitted to hospitals in England with acute epiglottitis.

Epilepsy is estimated to affect more than 500,000 people in the UK. This means that almost one in every 100 people has the condition. Seizures The cells in the brain, known as neurons, conduct electrical signals and communicate with each other in the brain using chemical messengers. During a seizure, there are abnormal bursts of neurons firing off electrical impulses, which can cause the brain and body to behave strangely. The severity of seizures can differ from person to person. Some people simply experience an odd feeling with no loss of awareness, or may have a \"trance-like\" state for a few seconds or minutes, while others lose consciousness and have convulsions (uncontrollable shaking of the body). Some people may only have a single seizure at some point during their life. If they do not have a high risk of having further seizures, they would not be regarded as having epilepsy.  Read more about the symptoms of epilepsy. What causes epilepsy? Epilepsy can start at any age, but it most often begins during childhood. It's often not possible to identify a specific reason why someone develops the condition, although some cases \u2013 particularly those that occur later in life \u2013 are associated with damage to the brain. For example, epilepsy can be caused by strokes, brain tumours and severe head injuries. Some cases of epilepsy may be caused by changes in the brain that occur as a result of the genes you inherit from your parents. Read more about the causes of epilepsy. How epilepsy is diagnosed Epilepsy is most often diagnosed after you have had more than one seizure. This is because many people have a one-off epileptic seizure during their lifetime. The most important information needed to make a diagnosis is a description of your seizures from yourself and someone who witnessed the event, but tests may also be carried out to help determine which areas of your brain are affected and look for a potential cause. Read more about diagnosing epilepsy. How epilepsy is treated For most people with epilepsy, treatment with medications called anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) is recommended. These medications cannot cure epilepsy, but they are often very effective in controlling seizures. It can take some time to find the right type and correct dose of AED before your seizures can be controlled. In a few cases, surgery may be used to remove a specific area of the brain that is affected or to install an electrical device that can help control seizures. Read more about treating epilepsy. Living with epilepsy While epilepsy is different for everyone, there are some general rules that can make living with the condition easier. It's important to stay healthy through regular exercise, getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet and avoiding excessive drinking. You may have to think about your epilepsy before you undertake things such as driving, using contraception and planning a pregnancy. Advice is available from your GP or support groups to help you adjust to life with epilepsy. Read more about living with epilepsy. Want to know more? Epilepsy Action: what is epilepsy?

The problem can affect anyone, but it's most common in young babies and people older than 60. It can cause blurred vision, sore eyelids and sticky eyes. See your GP or optician if you have persistent watering eyes or any lumps or swelling around your eyes. What causes watering eyes? A problem with the glands Glands in the eyelids (Meibomian glands) normally secrete an oily substance that slows the evaporation of tears between blinks. When these glands don't function properly, known as Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), it can result in dry patches on your eyes. These become sore, and extra tears are produced as a reflex. This is the most likely cause of watering eyes. Other causes Other problems that can cause extra tears to be produced include: the lower eyelid sagging away from the eye (ectropion) \u2013 this makes it difficult for tears to reach the drainage ducts eyelids that roll inwards (entropion) inflammation of the edges of the eyelids (blepharitis) blocked or narrowed tear ducts eye irritation (for example, from chemical fumes or grit) an eye infection, such as conjunctivitis an allergy How are watering eyes investigated and treated? Your GP may refer you to an optometrist (eye specialist) for an examination, if no obvious reason for your watering eye can be found. Investigating the cause If necessary, you may then be referred to an ophthalmologist (eye surgeon) for further investigation. An ophthalmologist will look for blockages in your tear ducts, using local anaesthetic eye drops to help reduce any discomfort. This involves inserting a tiny probe into the narrow drainage channels on the inside of your eyelid to determine whether they are blocked. Fluid may also be injected into your tear duct, to see whether it comes out normally. Another test involves placing a drop of special dye in each eye. If there is a significant amount left in your eyes after five minutes of normal blinking, your tear ducts may be blocked. Scans of your tear ducts may sometimes be carried out. These can involve either injecting or placing special dyes into the tear ducts and then taking X-rays or other scans to help pinpoint the location of the blockage. Treatment If you're producing extra tears as a result of dry eye syndrome, you may be offered lubricating eye drops and advised to avoid activities that aggravate your symptoms. Medication may be needed if the cause is an allergy or infection, and surgery may be needed if a tear duct is blocked. If watering eyes aren't interfering with your life, you may choose not to have treatment.

This is called an episiotomy and makes the opening of the vagina a bit wider, allowing the baby to come through it more easily. Sometimes a woman's perineum may tear as the baby comes out. An episiotomy can help to avoid a tear or speed up delivery. Recent studies suggest that in first-time vaginal births, it is more common to have severe injuries involving the anal muscle if the perineum tears spontaneously rather than if an episiotomy is cut. Why you might need an episiotomy How it's performed Recovering from an episiotomy Preventing an episiotomy The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that an episiotomy should be considered if: the baby is in distress and needs to be born quickly, or there is a clinical need, such as a delivery that needs forceps or ventouse, or a risk of a tear to the anus If your doctor or midwife feels you need an episiotomy when you're in labour, they will discuss this with you. Around one in seven deliveries involves an episiotomy. If you have a tear or an episiotomy, you will probably need stitches to repair it. Dissolving stitches are used, so you won't need to return to hospital to have them removed. Why you might need an episiotomy An episiotomy may be recommended if your baby develops a condition known as foetal distress, where the baby's heart rate significantly increases or decreases before birth. This means the baby may not be getting enough oxygen and has to be delivered quickly to avoid the risk of birth defects or stillbirth.  Another reason for carrying out an episiotomy is when it's necessary to widen your vagina so instruments, such as forceps or ventouse suction, can be used to assist with the birth. This may be necessary if: you are having a breech birth, where the baby is not head-first you have been trying to give birth for several hours and are now tired after pushing  you have a serious health condition, such as heart disease, and it is recommended that delivery should be as quick as possible to minimise any further health risks  Research shows that in some births, particularly with forceps deliveries, an episiotomy may prevent third-degree tears, where the tear affects the anal muscle.  How an episiotomy is performed An episiotomy is usually a simple procedure. A local anaesthetic is used to numb the area around the vagina so you won't feel any pain. If you've already had an epidural, the dose can be topped up before the cut is made. Whenever possible, the doctor or midwife will make a small diagonal cut from the back of the vagina, directed down and out to one side. The cut is stitched together using dissolvable stitches after the birth. Recovering from an episiotomy Episiotomy cuts are usually repaired within an hour of the baby's birth. The cut (incision) may bleed quite a lot initially, but this should stop with pressure and stitches. Stitches should heal within one month of the birth. Talk to your midwife or obstetrician about which activities you should avoid during the healing period. Coping with pain It's common to feel mild to moderate pain after an episiotomy. Painkillers such as paracetamol can help relieve pain and are safe to use if you're breastfeeding.  Ibuprofen should not be used if your baby was born premature (before 37 weeks of pregnancy), had a low birth weight, or has a medical condition.  Aspirin also isn't recommended as it can be passed on to your baby through your breast milk. Your midwife will advise you if you're not sure what painkillers to take. Research suggests around 1% of women will feel severe pain that seriously affects their day-to-day activities and quality of life after having an episiotomy. If this happens, it may be necessary to treat the pain with stronger prescription-only painkillers, such as codeine. However, prescription-only medication may affect your ability to breastfeed safely. Your GP or midwife will be able to advise you about this. Placing an ice pack or ice cubes wrapped in a towel on the incision may also help relieve pain. Avoid placing ice directly on to your skin as this could cause damage. Using a doughnut-shaped cushion or squeezing your buttocks together while you're sitting may also help relieve the pressure and pain at the site of your cut. Exposing the stitches to fresh air can encourage the healing process. Taking off your underwear and lying on a towel on your bed for around 10 minutes once or twice a day may help. It's unusual for postoperative pain to last longer than two to three weeks. If the pain persists, you should speak to a doctor, health visitor, or another health professional. Going to the toilet Keep the cut and the surrounding area clean to prevent infection. After going to the toilet, pour warm water over your vaginal area to rinse it. Pouring warm water over the outer area of your vagina as you pee may also help ease the discomfort. You may find squatting over the toilet, rather than sitting on it, reduces the stinging sensation when passing urine. When you're passing a stool, you may find it useful to place a clean pad at the site of the cut and press gently as you poo. This can help relieve pressure on the cut. When wiping your bottom, make sure you wipe gently from front to back. This will help prevent bacteria in your anus infecting the cut and surrounding tissue. If you find passing stools particularly painful, taking laxatives may help. This type of medication is usually used to treat constipation and makes stools softer and easier to pass. For more information, read about treating constipation. Pain during sex There are no rules about when to start having sex again after you've given birth. In the weeks after giving birth, many women feel sore as well as tired, whether they've had an episiotomy or not. Don't rush into it. If sex hurts, it won't be pleasurable. If you've had a tear or an episiotomy, pain during sex is very common in the first few months. Studies have found around 9 out of 10 women who had an episiotomy reported resuming sex after the procedure was very painful, but pain improves over time. If penetration is painful, say so. It's not pleasant to have sex if it causes pain. If you pretend everything is all right when it isn't, you may start to see sex as a nuisance rather than a pleasure, which won't help you or your partner.  You can still be close without having penetration \u2013 for example, through mutual masturbation. Get tips on talking about sex. Pain can sometimes be linked to vaginal dryness. You can try using a water-based lubricant available from pharmacies to help. Don't use an oil-based lubricant, such as Vaseline or moisturising lotion, as this can irritate the vagina and damage latex condoms or diaphragms. You can get pregnant as little as three weeks after the birth of a baby, even if you're breastfeeding and your periods haven't started again. Use some kind of contraception every time you have sex after giving birth, including the first time (unless you want to get pregnant again). You will usually have an opportunity to discuss your contraceptive options before you leave hospital (if you've had your baby in hospital) and at the postnatal check. You can also talk to your GP or health visitor, or go to a contraception clinic at any time. Find sexual health services near you. Infection Look out for any signs that the cut or surrounding tissue has become infected, such as red, swollen skin, discharge of pus or liquid from the cut, or persistent pain. Tell your GP, midwife or health visitor as soon as you can about any possible signs of infection so they can make sure you get any treatment you need.  Exercises Strengthening the muscles around the vagina and anus by doing pelvic floor exercises can help promote healing, and will reduce the pressure on the incision and surrounding tissue. Pelvic floor exercises involve squeezing the muscles around your vagina and anus as though to stop yourself from going to the loo or passing wind (farting). Your midwife can show you how to perform the exercises correctly. You can also read pelvic floor exercises for women (PDF, 68kb) for advice. Scar tissue For a few women, excessive, raised or itchy scar tissue forms around the place where a tear happened or where an episiotomy was performed. If your scar tissue is causing problems for you, tell your doctor. Preventing a perineal tear A midwife can help you avoid a tear during labour when the baby's head becomes visible.  The midwife will ask you to stop pushing and to pant or puff a couple of quick short breaths, blowing out through your mouth. This is so your baby's head can emerge slowly and gently, giving the skin and muscles of the perineum time to stretch without tearing. The skin of the perineum usually stretches well, but it may tear, especially in women who are giving birth for the first time.  Research suggests massaging the perineum in the last few weeks of pregnancy can reduce the chances of having an episiotomy during birth. A review of four trials showed massaging the perineum from 35 weeks of pregnancy reduced the likelihood of tears, needing an episiotomy and pain in women who had not given birth vaginally before.  The type and frequency of massage varied across the trials. Most involved inserting one or two fingers into the vagina and applying downward or sweeping pressure towards the perineum. The benefit was more marked among those women who carried out perineal sweeping twice a week.

The medical name for a nosebleed is epistaxis. During a nosebleed, blood flows from one or both nostrils. It can be heavy or light and last from a few seconds to 10 minutes or more. What to do To stop a nosebleed: sit down and firmly pinch the soft part of your nose, just above your nostrils, for at least 10-15 minutes lean forward and breathe through your mouth \u2013 this will drain blood down your nose instead of down the back of your throat place an ice pack or bag of frozen vegetables covered by a towel on the bridge of your nose  stay upright, rather than lying down, as this reduces the blood pressure in the blood vessels of your nose and will discourage further bleeding If the bleeding eventually stops, you won't usually need to seek medical advice. However, in some cases you may need further treatment from your GP or in hospital (see below). Read more about treating nosebleeds. When to seek medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 if: you're taking a blood-thinning medicine (anticoagulant) such as warfarin or have a clotting disorder such as haemophilia and the bleeding doesn't stop you have symptoms of anaemia such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath and a pale complexion a child under two years of age has a nosebleed you have nosebleeds that come and go regularly Ask someone to drive you to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department or call 999 for an ambulance if: the bleeding continues for longer than 20 minutes the bleeding is heavy and you've lost a lot of blood you're having difficulty breathing you swallow a large amount of blood that makes you vomit the nosebleed developed after a serious injury, such as a car crash Find your nearest A&E department. What causes nosebleeds? The inside of your nose is full of tiny, delicate blood vessels that can become damaged and bleed relatively easily. Common causes of nosebleeds include: picking your nose blowing your nose very hard a minor injury to your nose changes in humidity or temperature causing the inside of the nose to become dry and cracked Occasionally, bleeding can come from the blood vessels deeper within the nose. This can be caused by a blow to the head, recent nasal surgery and hardened arteries (atherosclerosis). Read more about the causes of nosebleeds. Who gets nosebleeds? Nosebleeds are fairly common and most people will experience them every now and again. Anyone can get a nosebleed, but they most often affect: children between two and 10 years of age elderly people pregnant women people who regularly take aspirin or anticoagulants, such as warfarin people with blood clotting disorders, such as haemophilia Bleeding may also be heavier or last longer if you take anticoagulants, have a blood clotting disorder, or have high blood pressure (hypertension). Are nosebleeds serious? Nosebleeds aren't usually serious. However, frequent or heavy nosebleeds may indicate more serious health problems, such as high blood pressure or a blood clotting disorder, and should be checked. Excessive bleeding over a prolonged period of time can also lead to further problems such as anaemia. If your GP suspects a more serious problem is causing your nosebleeds, they may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for further tests. Preventing nosebleeds Things you can do to prevent nosebleeds include: avoid picking your nose and keep your fingernails short blow your nose as little as possible and only very gently keep your home humidified regularly apply petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline) to the inside of your nostrils to keep the inside of your nose moist wear a head guard during activities in which your nose or head could get injured always follow the instructions that come with nasal decongestants \u2013 overusing these can cause nosebleeds Talk to your GP if you experience nosebleeds frequently and aren't able to prevent them. They may refer you to an ENT specialist for an assessment. Page last reviewed: 21\/04\/2015 Next review due: 21\/04\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Erectile dysfunction is a very common condition, particularly in older men. It is estimated that half of all men between the ages of 40 and 70 will have it to some degree. When to see your GP See your GP if you have erectile dysfunction for more than a few weeks. They will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such as heart disease (when the heart\u2019s blood supply is blocked or interrupted). Why does erectile dysfunction happen? Erectile dysfunction can have a range of causes, both physical and psychological. Physical causes include: narrowing of the blood vessels going to the penis \u2013 commonly associated with high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol or diabetes hormonal problems surgery or injury Psychological causes of ED include: anxiety  depression  relationship problems Sometimes erectile dysfunction only occurs in certain situations. For example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner. If this is the case, it is likely the underlying cause of erectile dysfunction is psychological (stress related). If you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is physical. Erectile dysfunction can also be a side-effect of using certain medicines. Read more about the causes of erectile dysfunction. Diagnosis Although you may be embarrassed, it's important to get a diagnosis so that the cause can be identified. Your GP can usually diagnose erectile dysfunction. This will involve answering questions about your symptoms, as well as a physical examination and some simple tests. Read more about diagnosing erectile dysfunction. How is erectile dysfunction treated? Erectile dysfunction is primarily treated by tackling the cause of the problem, whether this is physical or psychological. The narrowing of the arteries (called atherosclerosis) is one of the most common causes of ED. In these cases your GP may suggest lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, to try to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. This may help to relieve your symptoms as well as improving your general health. You may also be given medication to treat atherosclerosis, such as cholesterol-lowering statins and drugs to reduce your blood pressure. A number of treatments have been successful in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Medication, such as sildenafil (sold as Viagra), can be used to manage it in at least two-thirds of cases. Vacuum pumps that encourage blood to flow to the penis and cause an erection are also successful in 90% of cases. Psychological treatments include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and sex therapy. Overall, treatments for erectile dysfunction have improved significantly in recent years. Most men are eventually able to have sex again. Read more about treating erectile dysfunction.

It can be serious if not treated promptly. The infection develops suddenly and can spread through the body quickly. Severe infections can spread deep into the body, and can be life threatening. Most cases are successfully treated with antibiotics at home, although sometimes it needs to be treated in hospital. This page covers: Symptoms When to get medical advice Treatments Outlook Causes Prevention Symptoms of cellulitis Cellulitis causes an area of skin to suddenly become: red hot swollen painful tender It most often affects the lower legs, but can occur anywhere. In more severe cases, cellulitis can also be accompanied \u2013 and often preceded \u2013 by: a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above vigorous shaking (rigors) nausea and vomiting dizziness confusion These are signs that the infection has spread deeper into the body. Read more about the symptoms of cellulitis. When to get medical advice See your GP or visit your nearest minor injuries unit as soon as possible if an area of your skin suddenly turns red, painful and hot. Early treatment can help reduce the risk of the infection becoming severe. Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately if: your face or the area around your eye is affected your symptoms are getting rapidly worse you experience other symptoms in addition to the changes in your skin, such as a fever or vomiting you have a weak immune system \u2013 for example, because of HIV or chemotherapy \u2013 or severe lymphoedema, a condition that causes swelling in the body's tissues a young child or elderly person has possible cellulitis Treatments for cellulitis Cellulitis is usually treated with antibiotics. Many infections can be treated with antibiotic tablets at home. You'll usually be given a seven-day course of tablets, and your symptoms should start to improve after a few days. Make sure you complete the whole course of medicine you've been given, even if you're feeling better. Contact your GP if your symptoms get worse after a few days or don't improve within a week. For serious infections, treatment is usually started in hospital. You'll normally be given antibiotics directly into a vein through an injection or a drip. Many hospitals can then arrange for this treatment to continue at home or in an outpatient clinic. Treatment is usually for seven days. If the infection responds to treatment quickly, it may be possible to complete the course with antibiotic tablets instead of having injections or a drip. Read more about how cellulitis is treated. Outlook for cellulitis Cellulitis can usually be treated successfully with antibiotics, and most people make a full recovery. But there is a risk it could cause potentially serious problems, particularly if it's not treated quickly, such as: blood poisoning (septicaemia) \u2013 where the bacteria enter the blood kidney damage leg ulcers Septicaemia and kidney problems can be life threatening and require immediate treatment in hospital. Causes of cellulitis Cellulitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection. The bacteria that cause it often live harmlessly on the skin, but they can lead to an infection if they get into a break in your skin, such as: a bruise, cut or graze  an animal bite or insect bite a leg ulcer dry, cracked skin \u2013 for example, because of eczema or athlete's foot In most cases the trigger for the infection is unknown. The infection isn't normally spread from person to person. Read about the causes of cellulitis, including information on who's most at risk of the condition. Preventing cellulitis If you've had cellulitis before, you're more likely to get it again. It's not always possible to prevent it, but the following measures may help reduce your risk: use moisturiser if your skin is dry or prone to cracking lose weight if you're overweight \u2013 being obese can increase your risk of cellulitis try to ensure any conditions that can increase your risk of cellulitis \u2013 such as eczema, athlete's foot, leg ulcers and lymphoedema \u2013 are well managed make sure any cuts, grazes or bites are kept clean \u2013 wash them under running tap water and cover them with a plaster or dressing wash your hands regularly \u2013 particularly when treating or touching a wound or skin condition If you get cellulitis often or severely, your GP may refer you to a skin specialist called a dermatologist, or an infection specialist, to discuss the option of taking antibiotics on a long-term basis to protect against further infections. Cellulitis and cellulite Cellulite is a cosmetic problem caused by fatty deposits that form underneath the skin. It is not related to cellulitis. If you're overweight, losing weight is the best way of dealing with cellulite. Read more information and advice about losing weight.

It's usually seen in women, on the thighs and lower legs. There are many types of panniculitis \u2013 with different causes \u2013 but the condition generally causes the skin to feel hard and to develop painful red lumps (nodules) or patches (plaques), making it look darker in places. Panniculitis usually affects the shins and calves, but may spread to the thighs, forearms and chest. It tends to clear up within six weeks, fading like a bruise, usually without scarring. When the inflammation has settled, a depression in the skin may be left, which can be temporary or permanent. Many people get recurring bouts of panniculitis. Other symptoms As well as skin symptoms, panniculitis may also be associated with: fever fatigue weight loss nausea and vomiting joint pain What are the causes? There are a wide range of possible causes of panniculitis, although often the cause is not known. Common causes include: an infection \u2013 usually a viral or bacterial infection, but sometimes tuberculosis an inflammatory disease such as Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis some medicines, including the oral contraceptive pill or sulphonamides (a group of antibiotics) sarcoidosis \u2013 a rare disease that causes body cells to form into clumps, called granulomas, in the lungs and skin leukaemia (cancer of the white blood cells) or lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system, part of your immune system) Some cases of panniculitis may be caused by the body's immune system mistakenly attacking the fat cells. Types of panniculitis The layer of fat underneath the skin is made of lobules (groups of fat cells) held together by connective tissue. Doctors sometimes classify the disease as either: \u2018mostly septal\u2019 \u2013 the inflammation mostly affects the connective tissue \u2018mostly lobular\u2019 \u2013 it mostly affects the fat lobules Some people will also have vasculitis, where the immune system attacks the body's blood vessels. If a blood vessel is inflamed, it can narrow or close off, this can limit, or even prevent, blood flow through the vessel and potentially damage organs. The most common type of panniculitis is erythema nodosum, which affects the shins. In about half of all cases of erythema nodosum, the cause is unknown. A similar form of the disease is Weber-Christian disease, also known as idiopathic lobular panniculitis (idiopathic means \u2018unknown cause\u2019). This most commonly affects the thighs and lower legs of women aged 30-60, and can also cause the non-skin symptoms mentioned above, such as fever and fatigue. Other types include: erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis), which usually affects the calves of young women and is often caused by tuberculosis cold panniculitis, which affects areas of skin exposed to the cold \u2013 for example, it can affect the cheeks and forehead of infants and children subcutaneous sarcoidosis, when the cause is the rare disease sarcoidosis A full list of all the different types of panniculitis can be found on DermNet NZ, which provides pictures and detailed information on the specific types. How is panniculitis treated? Doctors will aim to treat the underlying cause of the panniculitis, if known, and relieve some of the symptoms. While treatment is underway, you will be asked to ensure you get enough rest and to elevate the affected area when possible. Treatments will vary; for example, if panniculitis is triggered by medication, this medicine should be stopped \u2013 but don't stop taking any medication without first speaking to your GP. If the cause is a bacterial infection, you will be prescribed anti-inflammatory antibiotics, such as tetracycline, to clear the infection. If the cause is sarcoidosis, you may not need any medical treatment as the disease often goes away on its own with time (usually a couple of years). Often, simple lifestyle changes, over the counter painkillers, and support bandages are all that is needed to control any flare ups. Read more about managing sarcoidosis.  The following treatments may help to relieve symptoms: Joint pain and painful skin nodules can be relieved with anti-inflammatory painkillers (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. A solution of potassium iodide may help to relieve symptoms \u2013 this is thought to have an effect on white blood cells (read more about potassium iodide treatment for skin conditions). The inflammation may occasionally be treated with steroid cream, steroid tablets or injections, or immunosuppressants (drugs to weaken the immune system), if the immune system is responsible. If the condition is severe and the above treatments don't help, you may wish to consider surgical removal of particularly bad patches of skin. Your GP will refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) to discuss the pros and cons of surgery. Community content from HealthUnlocked Which painkiller?

It usually causes a bright red rash on the cheeks. Although the rash can look alarming, slapped cheek syndrome is normally a mild infection that clears up by itself in one to three weeks. Once you've had the infection, you're usually immune to it for life. However, slapped cheek syndrome can be more serious for some people. If you're pregnant, have a blood disorder or a weakened immune system and have been exposed to the virus, you should get medical advice. This page covers: Symptoms When to get medical advice What to do if you or your child has it How you get it Prevention Symptoms of slapped cheek syndrome Symptoms of slapped cheek syndrome usually develop 4-14 days after becoming infected, but sometimes may not appear for up to 21 days. Initial symptoms Some people with slapped cheek syndrome won't notice any early symptoms, but most people will have the following symptoms for a few days: a slightly high temperature (fever) of around 38C (100.4F) a runny nose  a sore throat a headache an upset stomach feeling generally unwell The infection is most contagious during this initial period. In adults, these symptoms are often accompanied by joint pain and stiffness, which may continue for several weeks or even months after the other symptoms have passed. Slapped cheek rash After a few days, a distinctive bright red rash on both cheeks (the so-called \"slapped cheeks\") normally appears, although adults may not get this. By the time this rash develops, the condition is no longer contagious. After another few days, a light pink rash may also appear on the chest, stomach, arms and thighs. This often has a raised, lace-like appearance and may be itchy. The rashes will normally fade within a week or two, although occasionally the body rash may come and go for a few weeks after the infection has passed. This can be triggered by exercise, heat, anxiety or stress. When to get medical advice You don't usually need to see your GP if you think you or your child has slapped cheek syndrome, as the condition normally gets better on its own. However, you should contact your GP, call NHS 111 or contact your local out-of-hours service if you have been exposed to anyone with slapped cheek or you have symptoms of the infection and: you're pregnant \u2013 infection in pregnancy, particularly early pregnancy, carries a risk of causing miscarriage, stillbirth or other complications; however, this risk is small and most pregnant women will already be immune (read more about the risks of slapped cheek syndrome in pregnancy) you have a blood disorder, such as sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia, or a weakened immune system \u2013 the infection can cause severe anaemia that may need to be treated in hospital you have symptoms of severe anaemia, such as very pale skin, severe shortness of breath, extreme tiredness or fainting In these cases, a blood test may be carried out to see if you're immune to the infection. If you're not immune, you'll be monitored carefully to check for any problems. If you develop severe anaemia, it's likely that you'll need to be admitted to hospital and have a blood transfusion to replace your damaged blood cells. What to do if you or your child has slapped cheek Slapped cheek syndrome is usually mild and should clear up without specific treatment. If you or your child is feeling unwell, you can try the following to ease the symptoms: rest and drink plenty of fluids \u2013 babies should continue their normal feeds for a fever, headaches or joint pain, you can take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen \u2013 children under 16 shouldn't take aspirin to reduce itchiness, you can take antihistamines or use an emollient (moisturising lotion) \u2013 some antihistamines are not suitable for young children, so check with your pharmacist first Unless you or your child is feeling unwell, there\u2019s no need to stay away from school or work once the rash has developed, as the infection is no longer contagious by this point. It's a good idea to notify your child's school about the infection, so children who develop early symptoms can be spotted quickly and vulnerable people can be made aware that they may need to get medical advice. How do you get slapped cheek syndrome? Slapped cheek syndrome is caused by a virus called parvovirus B19. This is found in the droplets in the coughs and sneezes of someone with the infection. The virus is spread in a similar way to colds and flu. You can become infected by:  inhaling droplets that are sneezed or coughed out by someone with the infection touching a contaminated surface or object and then touching your mouth or nose Someone with slapped cheek syndrome is infectious during the period before the rash develops. Once the rash appears, the condition can no longer be passed on. Preventing slapped cheek syndrome It's very difficult to prevent slapped cheek syndrome, because people who have the infection are most contagious before they develop any obvious symptoms. However, making sure that everyone in your household washes their hands frequently may help stop the infection from spreading. There's currently no vaccine available to protect you against the condition.

The rash tends to flare up and go away on its own, but you may need treatment for some of the symptoms. The skin disorder gets its name from the appearance of the rash: erythema = redness multi = of many forme = shapes Most people with erythema multiforme just have a few spots that clear up quickly. However, there's also a rare and more severe form that can affect the mouth, genitals and surface of the eyes and be life-threatening. This form is known as erythema multiforme major, bullous erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Who is affected? Erythema multiforme is usually seen from the ages of 10 to 40; it is rare in children under three or people over 50. It does not appear to run in families. What are the symptoms? Symptoms of erythema multiforme depend on the type of disease you have. Erythema multiforme minor (mild) If you have the mild form of erythema multiforme, you may feel perfectly well but just have an uncomfortable rash. It's usually caused by the herpes simplex virus or a bacterial infection (see What triggers it? below). It typically develops 10-14 days after a recurrent herpes simplex infection. The spotty rash looks a bit like hives and usually erupts over 24 hours, starting on the hands and feet, and spreading to the limbs, upper body and face. It may cause a mild burning or itching feeling. The spots are small raised areas, some of which then develop into \"bulls-eye\" or \"target lesions\" measuring about 1-3cm across \u2013 these have a dark red centre with a blister or crust, surrounded by a paler pink ring with a bright red outermost ring. These target lesions are one of the main characteristics of erythema multiforme. The rash usually fades over two to four weeks, but can return. This type of erythema multiforme does not progress to erythema multiforme major or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Erythema multiforme major (severe) or Stevens-Johnson syndrome This rare form of the disease is much more severe, and can be life-threatening. It's usually caused by a reaction to mycoplasma bacteria or certain medications. The rash is made up of bigger spots, which may fuse to produce large red areas. They may blister to reveal raw, painful sores. You might also have: a fever and headache, and feel unwell bloodshot or dry eyes that may burn, itch and weep (read more about herpes simplex eye infections) sensitivity to light and blurred vision raw sores inside your mouth, making it hard to eat and drink swollen lips covered in crusts itchy skin achy joints  corneal ulcers septicaemia myocarditis hepatitis haematuria acute tubular necrosis What triggers it? In around half of cases, no cause can be found and nothing appears to trigger the symptoms. Bacterial infections and certain medications are thought to be possible triggers. Infection Most cases of erythema multiforme are caused by a viral infection \u2013 usually the herpes simplex (cold sore) virus. The cold sore virus lies dormant and tends to be reactivated by certain triggers. This explains why the condition can flare up repeatedly. Children with erythema multiforme will usually develop a cold sore a few days before the rash starts. The second most common trigger is a chest infection caused by mycoplasma bacteria. Medication Medication can sometimes trigger the more severe type of erythema multiforme. Possible medications include: antibiotics such as sulfonamides, tetracyclines, amoxicillin and ampicillin anticonvulsants (used to treat epilepsy) such as phenytoin and barbiturates non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Experts believe that an erythema multiforme reaction involves damage to the tissues and blood vessels of the skin. What to do If you think you have erythema multiforme, see your GP immediately. Your GP may be able to diagnose the condition just by looking at your skin. If your GP is uncertain of the diagnosis, you'll be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist). If Stevens-Johnson syndrome is suspected, an urgent hospital referral is needed, as this can spread rapidly and be life-threatening. How is it treated? Treatment aims to control the illness that is causing erythema multiforme, prevent infection and manage the symptoms. Your doctor may advise you to stop taking medication that may be triggering the symptoms. Don't stop any medication without speaking to your GP first. Symptoms can be treated with: antihistamines to control the itching moist compresses held to the skin antiviral tablets, if the cause is a herpes simplex infection anaesthetic mouthwash to ease the discomfort of mouth sores painkillers for skin or mouth pain If you have Stevens-Johnson syndrome, you may need to stay in hospital and be treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) or a burns unit. You may also need: strong painkillers for the raw areas  a mouthwash that contains an anaesthetic, to temporarily numb the mouth and make eating easier a liquid diet if the mouth is badly affected a short course of corticosteroid tablets to control the inflammation \u2013 only on specialist advice antibiotics if septicaemia is suspected eye drops or eye ointment Possible complications Mild cases of erythema multiforme do not usually cause complications, and often gets better in two to three weeks using simple lotions. However, the disease can return, usually when the cause is the herpes simplex virus. In cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, possible complications can include: blood poisoning (septicaemia) loss of body fluids and septic shock (where blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level) permanent skin damage and scarring skin infection (cellulitis) permanent eye damage Occasionally, internal organs may be affected, causing inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), lungs (pneumonia), kidneys (nephritis) or liver (hepatitis). More severe cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome may take up to six weeks or longer to get better. A few people are left with scars on their skin after the rash clears up, and damaged vision if their eyes have been affected.

Treatments will vary; for example, if panniculitis is triggered by medication, this medicine should be stopped \u2013 but don't stop taking any medication without first speaking to your GP. If the cause is a bacterial infection, you will be prescribed anti-inflammatory antibiotics, such as tetracycline, to clear the infection. If the cause is sarcoidosis, you may not need any medical treatment as the disease often goes away on its own with time (usually a couple of years). Often, simple lifestyle changes, over the counter painkillers, and support bandages are all that is needed to control any flare ups. Read more about managing sarcoidosis.  The following treatments may help to relieve symptoms: Joint pain and painful skin nodules can be relieved with anti-inflammatory painkillers (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. A solution of potassium iodide may help to relieve symptoms \u2013 this is thought to have an effect on white blood cells (read more about potassium iodide treatment for skin conditions). The inflammation may occasionally be treated with steroid cream, steroid tablets or injections, or immunosuppressants (drugs to weaken the immune system), if the immune system is responsible. If the condition is severe and the above treatments don't help, you may wish to consider surgical removal of particularly bad patches of skin. Your GP will refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) to discuss the pros and cons of surgery. Community content from HealthUnlocked Which painkiller?

Symptoms can begin at any age. Some people with erythromelalgia may have had it from early childhood, while some are just affected in adult life. How severe can it be? People with erythromelalgia typically suffer episodes or flare-ups of severe pain lasting from a few minutes to days. Flare-ups usually start as an itching sensation, which worsens to a severe burning pain and tender, mottled red skin. The hands and feet are most commonly affected, usually on both sides of the body, but erythromelalgia can also affect the arms, legs, ears and face. The pain can be severe enough to make walking, standing, socialising, exercising and sleeping difficult. It can have a significant impact on work or school life. What are the triggers? Symptoms are usually triggered by an increase in body temperature. They can start after exercising, wearing warm socks, gloves or tight shoes, entering a warm room, being dehydrated, or even consuming alcohol or spicy food. What is the cause? For most people with erythromelalgia, the cause is unknown. However, in some cases, an underlying cause may be found \u2013 usually a medical condition or a faulty gene (see below).  Underlying disease Erythromelalgia sometimes results from an underlying disease, such as: having abnormally high levels of blood cells \u2013 either having too many platelets in the blood (thrombocythemia) or too many red blood cells (polycythaemia) damage to the peripheral nervous system \u2013 the network of nerves outside the brain and spinal cord (this damage is known as peripheral neuropathy) multiple sclerosis (MS) \u2013 a disease of the nerves in the brain and spinal cord an autoimmune problem \u2013 such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues It may also result from certain medications, such as verapamil or nifedipine. Genetic cause In some people with erythromelalgia, the disease is caused by a change (mutation) in a gene. This may have occurred spontaneously or been inherited from a parent, meaning that erythromelalgia can run in the family. Genes contain the genetic information, or the \"instructions\", to make a particular protein in the body. Genetic mutations occur when DNA changes, altering the genetic instructions. Erythromelalgia can be caused by changes in the SCN9A gene that provides the instructions for a sodium channel in pain nerves. Changes in sodium channels can lead to them opening more easily and staying open longer than usual. This increases or amplifies pain signals. It is not currently understood why the hands and feet are affected the most. Can it be treated? Cooling the skin and elevation Cooling the skin with a fan or cold water, or raising the affected hands or feet may relieve the pain. However, using ice or soaking the hands or feet for long amounts of time isn't recommended, as this can lead to hypothermia or damage to the skin, causing ulcers. There's also a risk that the change in temperature will trigger a reactive flare-up when the hands or feet are removed. Even though a cool environment is helpful in reducing pain during attacks, the use of cold baths or showers is generally discouraged because of potential skin damage. Medication taken by mouth A number of different medications have shown potential in relieving symptoms, although no single drug helps everyone. Different treatments often need to be tried under the supervision of experienced clinicians, and combinations of different medicines are sometimes needed. Your doctor will discuss treatment options with you, as this will also depend on the type or erythromelalgia you have. Many treatments require referral to a specialist centre so that benefits and potential side effects can be closely monitored. Drugs used for other types of nerve pain may reduce symptoms. This includes anti-epilepsy drugs such as gabapentin, or low doses of tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, which can be effective in treating pain caused by increased sensitivity or damage to the nervous system. Drugs used for high blood pressure or Raynaud's disease can encourage the blood vessels to widen, and may be beneficial in some types of erythromelalgia. In adults, aspirin may relieve symptoms if the cause is an abnormally high number of blood cells (aspirin is not recommended for children). Intravenous infusion In some cases, when pain has not been controlled by medication taken by mouth (orally), an intravenous infusion (when medicine is given directly into your bloodstream via a drip) may be used. Lidocaine \u2013 a local anaesthetic that blocks sodium channels and can help nerve-related pain \u2013 may be given this way, but how long it works for varies. Your doctor will explain the procedure to you and how you should prepare for it. Information about you If you or your child has erythromelalgia, your clinical team will pass information about you\/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

E. coli O157 is found in the gut and faeces of many animals, particularly cattle. It is an uncommon cause of gastroenteritis but can be caught by: Eating contaminated food (such as raw leafy vegetables or undercooked meat). Always wash all vegetables (including salad leaves) that will be eaten raw, unless they have been pre-prepared and are labelled \u2018ready to eat\u2019. Washing may reduce the risk of infection, but will not eliminate any risk of infection completely.  Touching infected animals or accidentally coming into contact with their faeces. Contact with people who have the illness, particularly if you do not wash your hands thoroughly after using the toilet or before handling food. Drinking water from inadequately treated water supplies. Swimming or playing in contaminated water, such as ponds or streams. Symptoms of E. coli O157 infection Symptoms include diarrhoea, stomach cramps and occasionally fever. About half of people with the infection will have bloody diarrhoea. People usually notice symptoms three to four days after they have been infected, but symptoms can start any time between one and 14 days afterwards. These symptoms can last up to two weeks. A small number of people with E. coli O157 infection go on to develop a serious condition called haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). This can sometimes lead to kidney failure and death, although this is rare. The risk of HUS is highest in children aged under five years. Some people become infected but don't develop symptoms. Find out more about gastroenteritis. Treatment and care at home There is no specific treatment for E. coli O157 infection. People who are infected can usually be cared for at home and most will get better without medical treatment. It is important to drink plenty of fluids, as diarrhoea can lead to dehydration. You should contact your GP or call NHS 111 as soon as possible if you or your child has bloody diarrhoea. Antibiotics are not recommended, and may increase the risk of complications. Anti-diarrhoea drugs such as loperamide (Imodium) are also not recommended as they may prolong your exposure to the toxin. Find out more about caring for a child with gastroenteritis and caring for an adult with gastroenteritis. How to prevent E. coli O157 from spreading at home Strict hygiene measures are essential to stop others getting infected. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap in running water and dry them completely. Use liquid soap and warm water if you can. Everyone must wash their hands after contact with an infected person, particularly after handling their clothes or bedding. Always wash hands after going to the toilet or changing babies\u2019 nappies, and before preparing or serving food or eating meals. Anyone who has been infected should avoid cooking or preparing food until 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared up. Do not share towels or nappy changing mats. Wash soiled clothing and bed linen separately from other clothes in a washing machine at the highest temperature possible (e.g. 60°C). Wipe down the outside of the washing machine with hot water and detergent after any heavily soiled load. After handling soiled bedclothes or clothing, wash your hands thoroughly. Clean toilet seats, toilet flush handles, basin taps, surfaces and toilet door handles at least daily, preferably more often, using hot water and detergent. Disinfection sprays and wipes or alcohol-based wipes may be used on toilet seats and other surfaces, but only after any visible soiling has been removed. Thick household bleach is highly effective. Dilute one part bleach to every 10 parts water for soiled surfaces and one part bleach to every 100 parts water for other hard surfaces. Ideally, use heavy-duty domestic rubber gloves and disposable cloths for cleaning. Dispose of cloths by placing them in a plastic bag, sealing the neck and placing in household waste. Thoroughly wash rubber gloves in hot water and detergent after use, then rinse and allow to dry. Do not clean soiled items in the kitchen. Deal with any spillage of faeces immediately. Clean the soiled area with hot water and detergent using heavy-duty domestic rubber gloves. Clean gloves (as above) and wash hands thoroughly. Returning to work or school Anyone who has had an E. coli O157 infection should stay away from work or school until they have been completely free of symptoms for 48 hours. Most people are no longer infectious after about a week, although some people, particularly children, may carry E. coli O157 for several months after they have got better. Some people need to take special care before returning to work or school: If you work in health or social care, or your work involves handling food, you should ask your local authority environmental health officers about when it is safe to return to work. This advice applies to both people who have been infected and those who live in the same household as someone who has. If you have a child under five years of age who has had E. coli, or lives with someone who has, you should talk to your GP about when it is safe for your child to return to school or nursery. Children under five years of age who have had an E. coli O157 infection should not swim in public swimming pools, or share paddling pools with others, until they have had test results showing that they are no longer an infection risk to others.

Most people with essential tremor experience a trembling, up-and-down movement of the hands. The arms, head, eyelids, lips and other muscles can also be affected. A tremor in the voice box (larynx) may cause a shaky voice. Essential tremor is usually more noticeable when you're trying to hold a position or do something with your hands, such as write. It doesn't always affect both sides of the body equally. Essential tremor is a common movement disorder affecting around four out of 100 adults over 40 years of age. Some people only have a mild tremor at first, which usually gets more severe over time. 'Normal' tremor Everyone has a very minor tremor when carrying out daily activities. For example, your hands will shake slightly when you hold them out in front of you. This is normal. Sometimes, the everyday level of tremor can become more noticeable, particularly in older people. Noticeable tremor is also normal and it's often caused by a raised level of adrenaline in the body, which can happen when a person is stressed, anxious or angry. When does a tremor become a problem? Essential tremor is more severe than normal tremor and it gradually gets worse over time. Eventually, the tremor may become so severe that carrying out normal, everyday activities can become difficult. Certain things may temporarily increase any tremor, including: tiredness caused by strenuous activity or lack of sleep smoking caffeine \u2013 from tea, coffee and some fizzy drinks being very hot or cold taking certain medicines \u2013 including some antidepressants and treatments for asthma When to see your GP It's important to visit your GP if you experience frequent or severe tremors. Although there's no specific test to diagnose essential tremor, your GP can carry out a physical examination and may request further tests to rule out other conditions (see causes, below). They'll also ask about your personal and family medical history as part of their assessment. Treating essential tremor There's no cure for essential tremor, but medicines can be used to help improve the symptoms in at least half of people with the condition. In rare cases, a severe tremor may be treated with surgery if it doesn't respond to medication. Read more about treating essential tremor. Inherited essential tremor Essential tremor can run in families and research suggests it's passed on by a faulty gene. At least half of people with the condition have a family member who also has it.  However, the age at which a tremor develops and its severity can vary greatly between different family members. Some people may also develop the faulty gene without inheriting it from either parent. Other causes of tremor There are a number of conditions which may cause tremor, including: overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) Parkinson's disease, a long-term condition affecting the way the brain co-ordinates body movements multiple sclerosis, a condition of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) affecting the senses and the body's actions dystonia, a range of movement disorders which cause involuntary muscle spasms stroke, which very rarely may result in tremor with few other symptoms peripheral neuropathy, where the peripheral nervous system is damaged A tremor can also be one of the withdrawal symptoms for people who are dependant on alcohol and have stopped or reduced their alcohol intake.

For example, a doctor who gives a patient with terminal cancer an overdose of muscle relaxants to end their life would be considered to have carried out euthanasia. Assisted suicide is the act of deliberately assisting or encouraging another person to kill themselves. If a relative of a person with a terminal illness were to obtain powerful sedatives, knowing that the person intended to take an overdose of sedatives to kill themselves, they may be considered to be assisting suicide. Legal position Both active euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal under English law. Depending on the circumstances, euthanasia is regarded as either manslaughter or murder and is punishable by law, with a maximum penalty of up to life imprisonment.  Assisted suicide is illegal under the terms of the Suicide Act (1961) and is punishable by up to 14 years' imprisonment. Attempting to kill yourself is not a criminal act in itself.  Types of euthanasia Euthanasia can be classified in different ways, including: active euthanasia \u2013 where a person deliberately intervenes to end someone\u2019s life \u2013 for example, by injecting them with a large dose of sedatives   passive euthanasia \u2013 where a person causes death by withholding or withdrawing treatment that is necessary to maintain life, such as withholding antibiotics from someone with pneumonia   Euthanasia can also be classified as: voluntary euthanasia \u2013 where a person makes a conscious decision to die and asks for help to do this non-voluntary euthanasia \u2013 where a person is unable to give their consent (for example, because they are in a coma or are severely brain damaged) and another person takes the decision on their behalf, often because the ill person previously expressed a wish for their life to be ended in such circumstances involuntary euthanasia \u2013 where a person is killed against their expressed wishes Depending on the circumstances, voluntary and non-voluntary euthanasia could be regarded as either voluntary manslaughter (where someone kills another person, but circumstances can partly justify their actions) or murder.  Involuntary euthanasia is almost always regarded as murder. There are arguments used by both supporters and opponents of euthanasia and assisted suicide. Read more about the arguments for and against euthanasia and assisted suicide. End of life care If you are approaching the end of life, you have a right to good palliative care \u2013 to control pain and other symptoms \u2013 as well as psychological, social and spiritual support. You're also entitled to have a say in the treatments you receive at this stage. For example, under English law, all adults have the right to refuse medical treatment, as long as they have sufficient capacity (the ability to use and understand information to make a decision). If you know that your capacity to consent may be affected in the future, you can arrange a legally binding advance decision (previously known as an advance directive). An advance decision sets out the procedures and treatments that you consent to and those that you do not consent to. This means that the healthcare professionals treating you cannot perform certain procedures or treatments against your wishes. Read more about your rights when approaching the end of life. Other countries Active euthanasia is currently only legal in Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg. Under the laws in these countries, a person\u2019s life can be deliberately ended by their doctor or other healthcare professional. The person is usually given an overdose of muscle relaxants or sedatives. This causes a coma and then death. However, euthanasia is only legal if the following three criteria are met: The person has made an active and voluntary request to end their life. It is thought that they have sufficient mental capacity to make an informed decision regarding their care. It is agreed that the person is suffering unbearably and there is no prospect for an improvement in their condition. Capacity is the ability to use and understand information to make a decision. Read more about the capacity to consent to treatment. In some countries the law is less clear, with some forms of assisted suicide and passive euthanasia legal, but active euthanasia illegal. For example, some types of assisted suicide and passive euthanasia are legal in Switzerland, Germany, Mexico and five American states.  Page last reviewed: 11\/08\/2014 Next review due: 11\/08\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Planning ahead Your wellbeing What end of life care involves End of life care is support for people who are in the last months or years of their life. End of life care should help you to live as well as possible until you die, and to die with dignity. The people providing your care should ask you about your wishes and preferences, and take these into account as they work with you to plan your care. They should also support your family, carers or other people who are important to you. You have the right to express your wishes about where you would like to receive care and where you want to die. You can receive end of life care at home or in care homes, hospices or hospitals, depending on your needs and preference.  People who are approaching the end of life are entitled to high-quality care, wherever they\u2019re being cared for. Find out what to expect from end of life care. Who provides end of life care? Different health and social care professionals may be involved in your end of life care, depending on your needs. For example, hospital doctors and nurses, your GP, community nurses, hospice staff and counsellors may all be involved, as well as social care staff, chaplains (of all faiths or none), physiotherapists, occupational therapists or complementary therapists.   If you are being cared for at home or in a care home, your GP has overall responsibility for your care. Community nurses usually visit you at home, and family and friends may be closely involved in caring for you too.  What is palliative care? End of life care includes palliative care. If you have an illness that can\u2019t be cured, palliative care makes you as comfortable as possible, by managing your pain and other distressing symptoms. It also involves psychological, social and spiritual support for you and your family or carers. This is called a holistic approach, because it deals with you as a \"whole\" person.   Palliative care isn\u2019t just for the end of life. You may receive palliative care earlier in your illness while you are still receiving other therapies to treat your condition.  Who provides palliative care? Many healthcare professionals provide palliative care as part of their jobs. An example is the care you get from your GP or community nurses.   Some people need additional specialist palliative care. This may be provided by consultants trained in palliative medicine, specialist palliative care nurses or specialist occupational therapists or physiotherapists.   Palliative care teams are made up of different healthcare professionals and can co-ordinate the care of people with an incurable illness. As specialists, they also advise other professionals on palliative care.   Palliative care services may be provided by the NHS, your local council or a charity.  When does end of life care begin? End of life care should begin when you need it and may last a few days, or for months or years.   People in lots of different situations can benefit from end of life care. Some of them may be expected to die within the next few hours or days. Others receive end of life care over many months.   People are considered to be approaching the end of life when they are likely to die within the next 12 months, although this isn\u2019t always possible to predict. This includes people whose death is imminent, as well as people who: have an advanced incurable illness such as cancer, dementia or motor neurone disease are generally frail and have co-existing conditions that mean they are expected to die within 12 months have existing conditions if they are at risk of dying from a sudden crisis in their condition have a life-threatening acute condition caused by a sudden catastrophic event, such as an accident or stroke The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) produced new guidance in December 2015 on the care of adults in the last two to three days of life. This guidance covers how to manage common symptoms, and dignity and respect for the dying person and their relatives and carers.   How do I find out about end of life care services in my area? If you are approaching the end of life, or caring for someone who is, and you want to find out about the care and support available, your first step is to speak to your GP or to call the number your healthcare professionals have given you. Part of their job is to help you understand which services are available locally. You can ask about all sorts of help \u2013 for instance, there may be particular night-time services they can tell you about. You can also use the \"Services near you\" search on this page. Find Me Help has a directory of services for people in the last years of life, their families, friends and carers, based on where you live. You can search for a wide range of practical, financial and caring services \u2013 for example, getting help around the house, taking control of your finances or speaking to a counsellor. Carers can search for different kinds of support, including medical help, respite cover, carers\u2019 support groups and bereavement services.  Planning ahead In this end of life care guide, \"end of life care\" also covers legal issues to help you plan ahead for your future care. These include creating a lasting power of attorney, so that the person or people of your choice can make decisions about your care if you are no longer able to do so yourself.

Bone cancer is itself rare, with around 600 cases being diagnosed in the UK each year. The three main types of primary bone cancer are chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Ewing sarcoma most commonly affects people who are 10 to 20 years old. Sarcomas A sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in the body's supporting tissues. Bone sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas are the two main types. Ewing sarcoma usually occurs in bone. It most commonly develops in the: pelvis bone (hips) thigh bone (femur) shin bone (tibia) However, the condition can also develop in the soft tissues surrounding the bone or joint. This type of Ewing sarcoma is known as extraosseous, which means outside the bone. Symptoms of Ewing sarcoma The symptoms of Ewing sarcoma will depend on the size of the cancer and where it is in the body. The main symptoms are pain in the affected area that gets progressively worse, and swelling and tenderness. Other possible, but less common, symptoms may include a high temperature (fever), severe tiredness and weight loss. In some cases of Ewing sarcoma, there may not be any symptoms at all. However, as the tumour grows it could weaken the affected bone, increasing the risk of fracture. What causes Ewing sarcoma? Like other types of bone cancer, the exact cause of Ewing sarcoma is unknown. As the condition tends to predominantly affect older children and teenagers, one theory is that it may be related to fast-growing bones. The rapid growth spurt that happens during puberty may in some way make bone tissue more vulnerable to cancer. Research has also found babies born with an umbilical hernia are three times more likely to develop Ewing sarcoma.  However, the increased risk is still small as only 1 in 110,000 children with an umbilical hernia will go on to develop the condition. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risks and causes of bone cancer. Diagnosing Ewing sarcoma When you visit your GP because of bone pain, they'll ask you about your symptoms and examine the affected area. Your GP may refer you for an X-ray to check for anything abnormal. If abnormalities are found, you'll be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (a bone specialist). They may recommend that you have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to examine the area in closer detail. A bone biopsy may be carried out to confirm whether cancer is present. A fine needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the affected area so it can be examined under a microscope. It can either be carried out using a general anaesthetic or a local anaesthetic. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about tests for bone cancer and the stages of bone cancer. Treating Ewing sarcoma Like all types of cancer, the earlier Ewing sarcoma is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat. Ewing sarcoma is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove. Ewing sarcoma also responds well to radiotherapy. It can be used to shrink the tumour after chemotherapy, and before or after surgery to lower the risk of the cancer returning. In some cases, surgically removing Ewing's sarcoma can be difficult \u2013 for example, if it develops in the pelvis. In this case, radiotherapy may be used as the main treatment. Surgery If surgery is recommended, the type you'll have will depend on: the size of the tumour where it is in your body whether it has grown into the tissues surrounding the bone You may have surgery to remove part or all of the bone affected by cancer. This type of surgery is known as resection. Limb-sparing surgery involves removing the area of bone on an arm or leg where the cancer is growing. A piece of metal (prosthesis) or a bone graft will be used to replace the piece of bone that is removed. In some cases, your whole arm or leg may need to be removed (amputation). This may be the only option to prevent the cancer returning if it's spread into the tissues surrounding the bone. For more information about the types of treatment for bone cancer, visit the Cancer Research UK website. Living with bone cancer If you're diagnosed with bone cancer, it can be upsetting and frightening. Knowing as much about the type of cancer you have and the best treatment options will help you make decisions. The majority of people who have surgery for bone cancer have a limb-sparing procedure. However, for some people, having their limb amputated may be the best option. This can be a very difficult situation to cope with and you may experience emotions such as grief and bereavement. It's important to seek help and talk about how you're feeling. You could talk to your partner, family, friends or the healthcare professionals in charge of your care. Talking to others will help you come to terms with your condition and treatment. There are also a number of practical issues you'll need to deal with, such as financial matters and coping with day-to-day activities such as school, college or work. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about your emotions and cancer and coping with bone cancer. Information about you If you or your child has Ewing sarcoma, your clinical team will pass information about you\/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Cancer occurs when some of the cells grow and multiply in an abnormal way. When cancer affects organs and solid tissues, it causes a growth called a tumour to form. Cancer can occur in any part of the body where the cells multiply abnormally.

It often causes a distinctive skin rash, which can look alarming but is harmless. Most children will have been infected with roseola by the time they enter nursery school. They will usually fight off the virus and recover fully within a week. Other medical terms for roseola are \"roseola infantum\" and \"exanthem subitum\". What are the symptoms? Many children get roseola so mildly that they don't really become ill, or the symptoms are too mild to be noticeable. Otherwise, it generally takes a week or two for symptoms to show after becoming infected. Roseola symptoms are general, and are typical of many other viral infections. Stage 1: fever A child with roseola may have: a sudden fever (high temperature), which typically lasts three to five days (read how to take your baby's temperature) a sore throat  a runny nose a cough mild diarrhoea loss of appetite swollen eyelids swollen glands in the neck Body temperature then returns to normal after three to four days, at which point a distinctive pink rash often appears. Stage 2: the rash The rash develops after the fever has died down. It is made up of pink spots or patches, which may be surrounded by a white halo. The rash tends to start on the chest, tummy and back, and often spreads to the face, neck and arms. Sometimes it can spread as far as the face and legs. It shouldn't be itchy or uncomfortable, and fades and disappears within two days. It is easy to confuse the rash with that of another condition, such as measles and rubella. Read about other common causes of skin rashes in babies and how to tell them apart. Possible complications Only in a few cases might a child develop complications such as fever-related seizures, but this is unusual.  These can be frightening, but in most cases are not serious. Read more about febrile seizures. What's the cause? Herpes virus Roseola is caused by a human herpes virus. There are eight types of herpes viruses that can infect humans. Roseola is usually caused by infection with type 6 (human herpesvirus 6, or HHV-6). Cold sores are usually caused by type 1 human herpes virus. How it spreads Roseola is spread in the same way as the common cold \u2013 a child can catch it by coming into contact with the mucus or saliva of an infected child. For example, when an infected child sneezes or coughs, tiny droplets of fluid containing the herpes virus are launched into the air and can be breathed in by others. Also, if an infected child sneezes on a door handle and another child touches the handle a few minutes later and then touches their mouth or nose, they may also catch it. Sharing cups is another common way for the virus to spread.  As soon as a child with roseola develops a fever, they can pass the virus to another child. They don't need to develop a rash to be contagious. But roseola never really causes an outbreak in the way chickenpox does, as it doesn't spread that rapidly. It can be caught at any time of the year. Who is affected? Roseola is most common in infants aged 6 to 18 months. It is only occasionally seen in adults. Older infants are at greatest risk as they haven't had time to develop antibodies against many viruses. Young babies tend to be protected as they still have the antibodies passed on from their mother in the womb. For more information on this, read How long do babies carry their mother's immunity? How is roseola treated? A child with roseola will usually just need bed rest and fluids while the illness runs its course. Keep your child hydrated by giving them plenty of cool water to drink. Even if your child isn't thirsty, try to get them to drink little and often to keep their fluid levels up. To help reduce your child's temperature, you can also: keep them cool if the environment is warm \u2013 for example, you can just cover them with a lightweight sheet keep their room cool \u2013 18C (65F) is about right (open a window if you need to) give them children's paracetamol or ibuprofen \u2013 you can't give them both at the same time, but if one doesn't work you may want to try the other later; these painkillers also act as antipyretics, which means they help reduce fever Paracetamol or ibuprofen aren't always necessary \u2013 for example, if your child isn't distressed by the fever or underlying illness. Always read the patient information leaflet that comes with the medication to find the correct dose and frequency for your child's age. Don't give aspirin to children under 16 unless it's specifically prescribed by a doctor. It has been linked with a rare but dangerous illness. Read more about treating a high temperature in children. Antibiotics are no good for treating roseola, as it is a viral (not a bacterial) infection. Should I see a GP? Most children with roseola recover within a week of the fever starting, so there's usually no need to see a GP. But see your GP if your child has: an unexplained seizure a fever greater than 103F (39.4C) a rash that doesn't improve after three days See a GP yourself if you have a weakened immune system \u2013 for example, because you're having chemotherapy \u2013 and you've had contact with a child with roseola. You'll be more vulnerable to the infection and may need monitoring. Should I keep my child away from nursery? Keep your child off school or nursery while they are unwell. They can go back when they're well, and there's no need to wait until the last spot disappears.  Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 21\/10\/2014 Next review due: 21\/10\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The cyst can range from the size of a pea to the size of a golf ball. Ganglion cysts look and feel like a smooth lump under the skin. They're made up of a thick, jelly-like fluid called synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate and cushion them during movement. Ganglions can occur alongside any joint in the body, but are most common on the wrist (particularly the back of the wrist), and the hand and fingers. Ganglions are harmless, but can sometimes be painful. If they don't cause any pain or discomfort, they can be left alone and may disappear without treatment, although this can take a number of years. It's not clear why ganglions form. They seem to occur when the synovial fluid that surrounds a joint or tendon leaks out and collects in a sac. Treatment options Treatment is usually only recommended if the cyst causes pain or affects the range of movement in a joint. The two main treatment options for a ganglion cyst are: draining fluid out of the cyst with a needle and syringe \u2013 the medical term for this is aspiration cutting the cyst out using surgery Availability on the NHS Most clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) don't fund treatment for ganglion cysts unless they cause significant pain or disrupt daily activities. If you want to have a cyst removed for cosmetic reasons, you'll probably have to pay for private treatment. Aspiration Aspiration is usually carried out in the outpatient department of your local hospital or GP surgery. Your doctor will remove as much of the contents of the ganglion as possible with a needle and syringe. The area is sometimes also injected with a dose of steroid medication to help prevent the ganglion returning, although there's no clear evidence this reduces the risk of recurrence. After the procedure, a plaster is placed over the small hole in your skin and can be removed about six hours after the procedure. Aspiration is a simple and painless procedure, and you'll be able to leave the hospital or surgery straight afterwards. It's often the first treatment option offered for ganglion cysts as it's less invasive than surgery. However, around half of all ganglion cysts treated using aspiration return at some point. If a cyst does return, surgery may be necessary. Surgery There are two ways surgery can be used to remove a ganglion cyst: open surgery \u2013 where the surgeon makes a medium-sized cut, usually about 5cm (2 inches) long, over the site of the affected joint or tendon arthroscopic surgery \u2013 a type of keyhole surgery where smaller incisions are made and a tiny camera called an arthroscope is used by the surgeon to look inside the joint; using the arthroscope as a guide, they then pass instruments through the incision to remove the cyst Both techniques can be performed under either local anaesthetic, where you are awake but won't feel any pain, or general anaesthetic, where you are asleep during the operation. The choice depends on where the ganglion is, which anaesthetic you'd prefer, and what your surgeon thinks is best. Open or keyhole surgery? Both techniques are equally effective at removing the cyst and reducing the risk of it returning. Keyhole surgery tends to cause less pain after the operation, but waiting times are often longer. After the operation The surgeon will stitch up the wound and a bandage will be placed over the area. This helps keep the area clean, reducing the risk of infection, as well as keeping it safe from any accidental bumps. The wound isn't usually painful, but you'll be given painkillers to take if you feel any discomfort after the operation. If the cyst was removed from your wrist or hand, you may need to wear a sling for the first few days. This helps keep your arm safe from any accidental knocks, and may help reduce swelling and discomfort. Move your fingers regularly to help keep the joints flexible. Surgery to remove a ganglion cyst leaves a scar, which can occasionally be thick and red. For some people, the skin around the scar remains numb after the operation. You'll usually experience some bruising in the area after your operation, but this should fade quickly. There's also a small possibility of temporary stiffness, swelling or pain afterwards. This may be caused by a minor infection that can be treated using antibiotics. Lasting pain or stiffness may need further treatment with physiotherapy. How much time you need to take off work after surgery to remove a ganglion cyst largely depends on where the ganglion is and your job. If your job involves manual labour, you may need to take time off. You can usually start driving again once it feels safe. Complications Having a ganglion cyst removed is a minor procedure, so complications are rare and seldom serious. However, a small number of people experience permanent stiffness and pain after surgery. If you have the operation under general anaesthetic, there's also a very small risk of complications to your heart and lungs. Pre-assessment tests before surgery should make sure your risks are as low as possible. There's always a chance a ganglion cyst will come back after treatment. This is more likely if the ganglion is on certain areas of the wrist.

To stay healthy or to improve health, adults need to do two types of physical activity each week: aerobic and strength exercises. How much physical activity you need to do each week depends on your age. Click on the links below for the recommendations for other age groups: early childhood (under 5 years old) young people (5 to 18 years old) older adults (65 and over)   Guidelines for adults aged 19-64 To stay healthy, adults aged 19-64 should try to be active daily and should do: at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity such as cycling or fast walking every week, and   strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms).   75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, such as running or a game of singles tennis every week, and strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms).  A mix of moderate and vigorous aerobic activity every week. For example, two 30-minute runs plus 30 minutes of fast walking equates to 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, and strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms).   A rule of thumb is that one minute of vigorous activity provides the same health benefits as two minutes of moderate activity.   One way to do your recommended 150 minutes of weekly physical activity is to do 30 minutes on 5 days a week.  All adults should also break up long periods of sitting with light activity. Find out why sitting is bad for your health. What counts as moderate aerobic activity? Examples of activities that require moderate effort for most people include: walking fast water aerobics riding a bike on level ground or with few hills doubles tennis pushing a lawn mower hiking skateboarding rollerblading volleyball basketball  Moderate activity will raise your heart rate and make you breathe faster and feel warmer. One way to tell if you're working at a moderate level is if you can still talk, but you can't sing the words to a song. Back to top What counts as vigorous activity? There is good evidence that vigorous activity can bring health benefits over and above that of moderate activity. Examples of activities that require vigorous effort for most people include: jogging or running swimming fast riding a bike fast or on hills singles tennis football rugby skipping rope hockey aerobics gymnastics martial arts Vigorous activity makes you breathe hard and fast. If you're working at this level, you won't be able to say more than a few words without pausing for breath. In general, 75 minutes of vigorous activity can give similar health benefits to 150 minutes of moderate activity. For a moderate to vigorous workout, try Couch to 5K, a nine-week running plan for beginners. Back to top What activities strengthen muscles? Muscle strength is necessary for: all daily movement to build and maintain strong bones to regulate blood sugar and blood pressure to help maintain a healthy weight Muscle-strengthening exercises are counted in repetitions and sets. A repetition is one complete movement of an activity, like a bicep curl or a sit-up. A set is a group of repetitions. For each strength exercise, try to do: at least one set eight to 12 repetitions in each set  To get health benefits from strength exercises, you should do them to the point where you struggle to complete another repetition. There are many ways you can strengthen your muscles, whether it's at home or in the gym. Examples of muscle-strengthening activities for most people include: lifting weights working with resistance bands doing exercises that use your own body weight, such as push-ups and sit-ups heavy gardening, such as digging and shovelling yoga Try Strength and Flex, a 5-week exercise plan for beginners to improve your strength and flexibility. You can do activities that strengthen your muscles on the same day or on different days as your aerobic activity - whatever's best for you. Muscle-strengthening exercises are not an aerobic activity, so you'll need to do them in addition to your 150 minutes of aerobic activity. Some vigorous activities count as both an aerobic activity and a muscle-strengthening activity. Examples include: circuit training aerobics running football rugby netball hockey Back to top Download a factsheet on physical activity guidelines for adults (19-64 years) (PDF, 568kb) For a summary on the health benefits of being more active, check out this Department of Health infographic (PDF, 500kb).

To stay healthy or to improve health, older adults need to do two types of physical activity each week: aerobic and strength exercises. The amount of physical activity you need to do each week depends on your age. Click on links below for the recommendations for other age groups: early childhood (under 5 years old) young people (5 to 18 years old) adults (19-64 years old)   Guidelines for older adults aged 65 and over Older adults aged 65 or older, who are generally fit and have no health conditions that limit their mobility, should try to be active daily and should do: at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity such as cycling or walking every week, and  strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms).          75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity such as running or a game of singles tennis every week, and strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms). a mix of moderate and vigorous aerobic activity every week. For example, two 30-minute runs, plus 30 minutes of fast walking, equates to 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, and strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms). A rule of thumb is that one minute of vigorous activity provides the same health benefits as two minutes of moderate activity.  You should also try to break up long periods of sitting with light activity, as sedentary behaviour is now considered an independent risk factor for ill health, no matter how much exercise you do. Find out why sitting is bad for your health.  Older adults at risk of falls, such as people with weak legs, poor balance and some medical conditions, should do exercises to improve balance and co-ordination on at least two days a week. Examples include yoga, tai chi and dancing. What counts as moderate aerobic activity? Examples of activities that require moderate effort for most people include: walking water aerobics ballroom and line dancing riding a bike on level ground or with few hills playing doubles tennis pushing a lawn mower canoeing volleyball  Moderate activity will raise your heart rate and make you breathe faster and feel warmer. One way to tell if you're exercising at a moderate level is if you can still talk, but you can't sing the words to a song. Daily chores such as shopping, cooking or housework don't count towards your 150 minutes, because the effort isn\u2019t enough to raise your heart rate, but they are important nonetheless, as they break up periods of sitting. Back to top What counts as vigorous aerobic activity? There is good evidence that vigorous activity can bring health benefits over and above that of moderate activity. Examples of activities that require vigorous effort for most people include: jogging or running aerobics swimming fast riding a bike fast or on hills singles tennis football hiking uphill energetic dancing martial arts Vigorous activity makes you breathe hard and fast.

Being physically active every day is important for the healthy growth and development of babies, toddlers and preschoolers. For this age group, activity of any intensity should be encouraged, including light activity and more energetic physical activity. The amount of physical activity you need to do each week is determined by your age. Click on the links below for the recommendations for other age groups: young people (5 to 18 years old) adults (19 to 64 years old) older adults (65 and over)   Babies Babies should be encouraged to be active throughout the day, every day. Before your baby begins to crawl, encourage them to be physically active by reaching and grasping, pulling and pushing, moving their head, body and limbs during daily routines, and during supervised floor play, including tummy time. Once babies can move around, encourage them to be as active as possible in a safe, supervised and nurturing play environment.  For more ideas, see Keeping kids active. Toddlers Children who can walk on their own should be physically active every day for at least 180 minutes (three hours). This should be spread throughout the day, indoors or outside. The 180 minutes can include light activity such as standing up, moving around, rolling and playing, as well as more energetic activity like skipping, hopping, running and jumping. Active play, such as using a climbing frame, riding a bike, playing in water, chasing games and ball games, is the best way for this age group to get moving. All children aged under five Children under five should not be inactive for long periods, except when they're asleep. Watching TV, travelling by car, bus or train, or being strapped into a buggy for long periods are not good for a child's health and development. There's growing evidence that such behaviour can increase their risk of poor health.  Find out why being sedentary is bad for your health.  All children under five who are overweight can improve their health by meeting the activity guidelines, even if their weight doesn't change. To achieve and maintain a healthy weight, they may need to do additional activity and make dietary changes. What counts as light activity for children? Light activity for children includes a range of activities, such as: standing up moving around walking less energetic play Back to top What counts as energetic activity for children? Examples of energetic activities suitable for most children who can walk on their own include: active play (such as hide and seek and stuck in the mud) running around jumping on a trampoline riding a bike dancing swimming climbing skipping rope gymnastics Energetic activity for children will make kids \"huff and puff\" and can include organised activities, such as dance and gymnastics. Any sort of active play will usually include bursts of energetic activity.

To stay healthy or to improve health, young people need to do three types of physical activity each week: aerobic exercise and exercises to strengthen bones and muscles. The amount of physical activity you need to do each week is determined by your age. Click on the links below for the recommendations for other age groups: early childhood (under 5 years old) adults (19 to 64 years old) older adults (65 and over)   Guidelines for 5- to 18-year-olds  To maintain a basic level of health, children and young people aged 5 to 18 need to do: at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day \u2013 this should range from moderate activity, such as cycling and playground activities, to vigorous activity, such as running and tennis on three days a week, these activities should involve exercises for strong muscles, such as push-ups, and exercises for strong bones, such as jumping and running Many vigorous activities can help you build strong muscles and bones, including anything involving running and jumping, such as gymnastics, martial arts and football. Children and young people should reduce the time they spend sitting watching TV, playing computer games and travelling by car when they could walk or cycle instead. Find out why sitting is bad for your health.  What counts as moderate activity? Examples of activities that require moderate effort for most young people include: walking to school playing in the playground riding a scooter skateboarding rollerblading walking the dog cycling on level ground or ground with few hills Moderate activity raises your heart rate and makes you sweat. One way to tell if you're working at a moderate level is if you can still talk, but you can't sing the words to a song. Back to top What counts as vigorous activity? Vigorous activity is linked to better general health, stronger bones and muscles, as well as higher levels of self-esteem. There is good evidence vigorous activity can bring health benefits over and above that of moderate activity. A rule of thumb is that one minute of vigorous activity provides the same health benefits as two minutes of moderate activity. There's currently no recommendation on how long a session of vigorous activity should be for this age group. Examples of activities that require vigorous effort for most young people include: playing chase energetic dancing swimming running gymnastics football rugby martial arts, such as karate cycling fast or on hilly terrain Vigorous activity makes you breathe hard and fast. If you're working at this level, you won't be able to say more than a few words without pausing for a breath. Back to top What activities strengthen muscles? Muscle strength is necessary for daily activities, and to build and maintain strong bones, regulate blood sugar and blood pressure, and help maintain a healthy weight. For young people, muscle-strengthening activities are those that require them to lift their own body weight or work against a resistance, such as lifting a weight. Examples of muscle-strengthening activities suitable for children include: games such as tug of war swinging on playground equipment bars gymnastics rope or tree climbing sit-ups, press-ups etc gymnastics football rugby tennis Examples of muscle-strengthening activities suitable for young people include: sit-ups, press-ups etc gymnastics resistance exercises with exercise bands, weight machines or hand-held weights rock climbing football basketball tennis Children and young people should take part in activities that are appropriate for their age and stage of development. Back to top What activities strengthen bones? Bone-strengthening activities produce an impact on the bones that promotes bone growth and strength. Examples of bone-strengthening activities for children include: activities that require children to lift their body weight or work against a resistance jumping and climbing activities, combined with the use of playground equipment and toys games such as hopscotch skipping with a rope walking running gymnastics dance football basketball martial arts Examples of bone-strengthening activities for young people include: dance aerobics weight training running gymnastics football rugby netball hockey badminton tennis skipping with a rope martial arts Children and young people should take part in activities that are appropriate for their age and stage of development.

It is often used interchangeably with the term \"proptosis\", which means the same thing. What causes exophthalmos? Exophthalmos can be caused by many different conditions. It's important that the underlying cause is identified so appropriate treatment can be given. Thyroid eye disease One of the main causes of exophthalmos in the UK is thyroid eye disease, also known as Graves' ophthalmopathy. This is an autoimmune condition that affects around one in every three people with an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) caused by Graves' disease. It is particularly common in women who are 30-50 years of age and people who smoke. An autoimmune condition is where the immune system (the body's defence against illness and infection) mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In the case of thyroid eye disease, the immune system attacks the muscles and fatty tissues around and behind the eye, causing them to become inflamed (swollen). Graves' disease is an autoimmune condition in which the thyroid is attacked, leading to an increase in the level of thyroid hormones in your blood. It's not clear exactly why thyroid eye disease sometimes occurs along with this condition. Thyroid eye disease can also occasionally affect people with an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) and, in rare cases, people with seemingly normal thyroid function. Other causes Exophthalmos can also have a number of other causes, but these are generally less common than thyroid eye disease. Other cause of exophthalmos can include: an injury to the eyes bleeding behind the eyes abnormally shaped blood vessels behind the eyes an infection of the tissue in the eye socket cancerous tumours \u2013 such as those caused by neuroblastoma and some soft tissue sarcomas Exophthalmos can also affect newborn babies if they are born with eye sockets that are shallower than normal. Other problems associated with exophthalmos Depending on what is causing your bulging eyes, you may also have other associated symptoms. For example, if exophthalmos is caused by a thyroid eye disease, your eyes may also be: inflamed, red and painful dry and \"gritty\" tearful sensitive to light (photophobia) You may also experience some double vision. In severe cases of exophthalmos, you may not be able to close your eyes properly. This can damage your corneas (the transparent tissue that covers the front of your eye) by causing them to dry out. If your corneas become very dry, an infection or ulcers (open sores) may develop. These could damage your vision if left untreated. There is also a small risk of the optic nerve (which transmits signals from the eye to the brain) becoming compressed if you have exophthalmos, which may affect your sight permanently if it is not treated quickly. Seeking medical advice It's important to see your GP or an optometrist (optician) if you notice that one or both of your eyes are protruding, as treatment is often more effective if it's started as soon as possible. If necessary, your GP or optometrist can refer you to an ophthalmologist (a specialist in diagnosing and treating eye conditions) for further assessment. The ophthalmologist will check how well you are able to move your eyes. They may also use an instrument called an exophthalmometer to measure how far your eyeball protrudes. If the ophthalmologist wants to examine your eye socket in more detail, a computerised tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be carried out. You may also have a blood test to assess how well your thyroid gland is working, and you may be referred for an assessment by an endocrinologist (a specialist in conditions affecting glands and hormones) if you are found to have abnormal thyroid hormone levels. Treating exophthalmos If exophthalmos is being caused by thyroid eye disease, the following treatments are often helpful: medication to correct the level of thyroid hormones in your blood \u2013 this will not necessarily improve the problems with your eyes, but may stop them getting worse corticosteroid medication given directly into a vein (intravenously) \u2013 this can help reduce the inflammation associated with the condition corrective surgery \u2013 this may be carried out to improve the appearance of your eyes once the inflammation is under control Other useful measures include stopping smoking, using artificial tears to reduce eye dryness and irritation, and wearing special lenses to correct double vision. In other cases, treatment will vary depending on the underlying cause of the condition. For example, treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and\/or surgery may be recommended if exophthalmos is caused by a tumour. Read more about treating exophthalmos. Outlook The outlook for exophthalmos can vary considerably. Many of the symptoms of thyroid eye disease tend to improve over time, although this can take a number of years, and there is a chance your eyes will continue to protrude if corrective surgery is not carried out. Some people with exophthalmos are left with long-term vision problems, such as double vision, but permanent visual impairment is rare if the condition is identified and treated promptly.

However, whether you will get the referral depends on what your GP feels is clinically necessary in your case. If you wish to be referred to a specialist in a particular field, such as a surgeon, or a gynaecologist (a specialist in the female reproductive system), you should see the GP you are registered with. This is because all your medical records are held by that practice. Your GP also generally understands your health history and treatments better than anyone and will base any decision for a specialist referral on this knowledge.  To learn more, see: Can I demand a specific treatment? If you ask your GP to refer you to a specialist, they will probably suggest that you first try various tests, or treatment options, to see whether your condition improves. Generally, you cannot self-refer to a specialist within the NHS, except when accessing sexual health clinics or accident and emergency (A&E) treatment. A specialist will only see you with a letter of referral from your GP. The letter will give the specialist essential background information, such as your medical history, and it will also contain details that the specialist needs to pay particular attention to. If you want to see a private specialist, you are still advised to get a letter of referral from your GP. However, whether you see a private specialist, with or without a GP referral, or are referred to an NHS specialist, your GP is not obliged to accept the specialist's recommendations. For more information, read: Do I need a referral for private treatment? Choosing a hospital or consultant If you are referred to a specialist by your GP or other health professional, such as dentist or ophthalmologist, you have the right to choose which hospital to go to for your outpatient appointments. You can choose any hospital or clinic in England as long as the service or treatment is routinely commissioned locally by your Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). You can also choose which consultant-led team will be in charge of your treatment. This means that if you choose a particular consultant for a procedure, you can choose to have your outpatient appointment at the hospital where the consultant works \u2013 but this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ll be seen by the consultant. Learn more about consultant choice. Once you have decided on a hospital, you could book your first outpatient appointment through the NHS e-Referral Service. This can happen in the following ways: Your GP can book it while you\u2019re at the surgery You can book it online using the Appointment Request letter your GP gives you You can phone the NHS e-Referral Service line on 0345 6088888 (open Monday-Friday, 8am to 8pm and on weekends and bank holidays 8am to 4pm) Learn more about patient choice of hospitals. Under the NHS Constitution, if your GP refers you for a condition that isn\u2019t urgent, you have the right to start treatment led by a consultant within 18 weeks from when you are referred, unless you want to wait longer or waiting longer is clinically right for you. For more information, read our guide to waiting times. Other services you may access through your GP As well as specialist referrals, your GP can help you find the right stop smoking services, weight loss service or other self-management programmes that help to prevent or manage a condition. Self-management programmes are not simply about educating you about your condition. They also let you take control of your health by learning new skills to manage your condition on a daily basis. These services may, however, not be available on the NHS and you may have to pay for them yourself. Some areas may offer local schemes that allow patients to have subsidised access to gyms or weight loss services such as WeightWatchers, Slimming World or Rosemary Conley. It is worth asking your GP if there are any schemes available in your area. You can also look for services in your area via the NHS service directories.   Your GP may also help you to find: Mental health services Mental health services are free on the NHS. You will usually need a referral from your GP to access them, although, there are some mental health services that allow patients to refer themselves for help. These commonly include services for drug and alcohol problems, as well as some psychological therapy services. Your GP will assess your circumstances and offer appropriate advice or treatment and if necessary refer you to a psychological therapy service or another specialist mental health service for further advice or treatment. These services may be provided by your GP practice, a large local health centre, a specialist mental health clinic, or hospital. The treatment may be provided on a one-to-one basis or in a group with others with similar difficulties, and therapy sometimes also involves partners and families. You have the legal right to choose which provider and team you're referred to by your GP for your first outpatient appointment. Clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) provide mental health services for their communities. You have the right to choose any mental health service provider in England as long as they provide a clinically appropriate similar service to the one your local CCG provides. Find out more about your choices in mental health. For more detailed information see our section mental health services explained, which includes a glossary of mental health services, teams and care pathways.

There are a number of different types of cancer that affect the eyes, including: eye melanoma squamous cell carcinoma lymphoma retinoblastoma \u2013 a childhood cancer Cancer can also sometimes develop in the tissues surrounding your eyeball or spread to the eye from other parts of the body, such as the lungs or breasts. This topic focuses on melanoma of the eye, one of the most common types of eye cancer. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the other types of eye cancer. This page covers: Symptoms of eye cancer About melanoma of the eye What causes eye melanoma? Diagnosing melanoma of the eye Treatments for eye melanoma Outlook for eye melanoma Symptoms of eye cancer Eye cancer doesn't always cause obvious symptoms and may only be picked up during a routine eye test. Symptoms of eye cancer can include: shadows, flashes of light, or wiggly lines in your vision blurred vision a dark patch in your eye that's getting bigger partial or total loss of vision bulging of one eye a lump on your eyelid or in your eye that's increasing in size pain in or around your eye, although this is rare These symptoms can also be caused by more minor eye conditions, so they're not necessarily a sign of cancer. However, it's important to get the symptoms checked by a doctor as soon as possible. Melanoma of the eye Melanoma is cancer that develops from pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Most melanomas develop in the skin, but it's also possible for them to occur in other parts of the body, including the eye. Eye melanoma most commonly affects the eyeball. Doctors sometimes call it uveal or choroidal melanoma, depending on exactly which part of your eye is affected. It can also affect the conjunctiva, the thin layer that covers the front of the eye, or the eyelid. What causes eye melanoma? Eye melanoma occurs when the pigment-producing cells in the eyes divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour. It's not clear exactly why this occurs, but the following factors may increase the risk of it happening: lighter eye colour \u2013 if you have blue, grey or green eyes, you have a higher risk of developing eye melanoma compared with people who have brown eyes white or pale skin \u2013 eye melanoma mostly affects white people and is more common in those with fair skin unusual moles \u2013 if you have irregularly shaped or unusually coloured moles, you're more at risk of developing skin cancer and eye melanoma use of sunbeds \u2013 there's some evidence to suggest that exposing yourself to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunbeds, for example, can increase your risk of eye melanoma overexposure to sunlight \u2013 this increases your risk of skin cancer, and may also be a risk factor for eye melanoma The risk of developing eye melanoma also increases with age, with most cases being diagnosed in people in their 50s. Read about the risk factors for other types of eye cancer on the Cancer Research UK website. Diagnosing melanoma of the eye If your GP or optician (optometrist) suspects you have a serious problem with your eyes, they will refer you to a specialist eye doctor called an ophthalmologist for an assessment. If they suspect you have melanoma of the eye, they'll refer you to a specialist centre for eye cancer. There are four centres in the UK, located in London, Sheffield, Liverpool, and Glasgow. It's likely you'll have a number of different tests at the centre, including: an eye examination \u2013 to look at the structures of your eyes in more detail and check for abnormalities an ultrasound scan of your eye \u2013 a small probe placed over your closed eye uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your eye; this allows your doctor to find out more about the position of the tumour and its size a fluorescein angiogram \u2013 where photographs of the suspected cancer are taken using a special camera after dye has been injected into your bloodstream to highlight the tumour Occasionally, a thin needle may be used to remove a small sample of cells from the tumour (biopsy). The genetic information in these cells is analysed to give an indication of the chances of the cancer spreading or coming back. Treatments for eye melanoma Treatment for melanoma of the eye depends on the size and location of the tumour. Your care team will explain each treatment option in detail, including the benefits and any potential complications. Treatment will aim to conserve the affected eye whenever possible. The main treatments for eye melanoma are: brachytherapy \u2013 tiny plates lined with radioactive material called plaques are inserted near the tumour and left in place for up to a week to kill the cancerous cells external radiotherapy \u2013 a machine is used to carefully aim beams of radiation at the tumour to kill the cancerous cells surgery to remove the tumour or part of the eye \u2013 this may be possible if the tumour is small and you still have some vision in your eye removal of the eye (enucleation) \u2013 this may be necessary if the tumour is large or you've lost your vision; the eye will eventually be replaced with an artificial eye that matches your other eye Chemotherapy is rarely used for eye melanoma, but may be suitable for other types of eye cancer. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the treatment options for eye cancer and the types of eye cancer surgery. Outlook for eye melanoma The outlook for melanoma of the eye depends on how big the cancer is at the time it's diagnosed and exactly which parts of the eye are affected.

If it's picked up early, retinoblastoma can often be successfully treated (children treated for retinoblastoma diagnosed at an early stage have a survival rate of more than 95%). Retinoblastoma can either affect one or both eyes. If it affects both eyes, it's usually diagnosed before a child is one year old. If it affects one eye, it tends to be diagnosed later (between the ages of two and three). This page covers: Symptoms of retinoblastoma Causes of retinoblastoma  Diagnosing retinoblastoma Treating retinoblastoma Screening for retinoblastoma Getting support Signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma Signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma include: an unusual white reflection in the pupil \u2013 this may be apparent in photos where only the healthy eye appears red from the flash, or you may notice it in a dark or artificially lit room a squint a change in the colour of the iris \u2013 in one eye or sometimes only in one area of the eye  a red or inflamed eye \u2013 though your child won't usually complain of any pain poor vision \u2013 your child may not focus on faces or objects, or they may not be able to control their eye movements (this is more common when both eyes are affected); they may say that they can't see as well as they used to These symptoms may be caused by something other than retinoblastoma. However, you should get them checked by your GP as soon as possible. It's unusual for retinoblastoma to progress unnoticed beyond the age of five. Signs in older children include the eye appearing red, sore or swollen, and some loss of vision in the affected eye. What causes retinoblastoma? Retinoblastoma is cancer of the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive lining at the back of the eye. During the early stages of a baby's development, retinal eye cells grow very quickly and then stop growing. However, in rare cases, one or more cells continue to grow and form a cancer called retinoblastoma. In about 4 out of 10 (40%) of cases, retinoblastoma is caused by a faulty gene, which often affects both eyes (bilateral). The faulty gene may be inherited from a parent, or a change to the gene (mutation) may occur at an early stage of the child's development in the womb. It's not known what causes the remaining 60% of retinoblastoma cases. In these cases, there's no faulty gene and only one eye is affected (unilateral). Around 50 to 60 children are diagnosed with retinoblastoma in the UK each year. Diagnosing retinoblastoma Your GP will carry out a 'red reflex test' in a darkened room using an ophthalmoscope (a magnifying instrument with a light at one end). When a light is shone into your child's eyes, your GP will see a red reflection if the retina is normal. If the reflection is white, it may be a sign of an eye condition such as cataracts, retinal detachment or retinoblastoma. In this case, your child will be urgently referred (within two weeks) to an eye specialist for further investigation. The eye specialist (ophthalmologist) will examine your child's eyes, and they may carry out another red reflex test. Eye drops will be used to increase the size of your child's pupils, allowing a clear view of the retina at the back of the eye. An ultrasound scan is also sometimes used to help diagnose retinoblastoma. This is a painless procedure where gel is rubbed on the outside of the eyelid and a small ultrasound probe is placed on the eyelid, which scans the eye. After these investigations, if the eye specialist thinks your child has retinoblastoma they'll refer them to one of two specialist retinoblastoma treatment centres, either at The Royal London Hospital (RLH) or the Birmingham Children's Hospital (BCH). Your child's appointment should be within a week of being seen at your local eye clinic. At the specialist centre, your child will need to have a general anaesthetic so their eyes can be thoroughly examined and a diagnosis of retinoblastoma can be confirmed or ruled out. Treating retinoblastoma Your child will be treated by a specialist retinoblastoma team at either the Royal London Hospital or Birmingham Children's Hospital. However, if your child needs chemotherapy, it will usually be carried out at a local children's cancer centre and overseen by the retinoblastoma team at one of the two specialist hospitals. The recommended treatment for retinoblastoma will depend on the stage of the tumour which can either be: intraocular \u2013 where the cancer is completely within the eye extraocular \u2013 where the cancer spreads beyond the eye to the surrounding tissue, or to another part of the body (this is rarely seen in the UK)  Most cases of retinoblastoma (9 out 10) are detected early and successfully treated before the cancer spreads outside the eyeball. If the cancer has spread beyond the eye it will be more difficult to treat. However, this is rare as the condition is usually identified well before it reaches this stage. Depending on the size and position of the tumour, your child's specialist will be able to accurately stage the cancer into one of a number of categories (A to E). Visit the American Cancer Society to read more about how retinoblastoma is staged. Treating small tumours There are two possible treatment options for treating small tumours contained within the eye. These are: laser treatment to the eye (photocoagulation or thermotherapy) freezing the tumour (cryotherapy) These treatments are carried out under general anaesthetic, so your child will be unconscious and won't feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure. In some cases, chemotherapy (see below) may be needed before or after these treatments. Treating larger tumours Larger tumours will be treated with one or a combination of the following treatments: brachytherapy \u2013 if the tumour isn't too large, small radioactive plates called plaques are stitched over the tumour and left in place for a few days to destroy the tumour, before being removed; radiotherapy to the whole eye may be recommended for larger tumours that haven't responded to other treatment methods chemotherapy \u2013 may be used to shrink the tumour before one of the above treatments are used, or it may be recommended if there's a chance of the cancer spreading; in some cases, chemotherapy medication can be delivered directly to the eye surgery to remove the eye \u2013 is often necessary for very large tumours where there's no sight from the eye; if your child needs to have their eye removed, they'll have an artificial eye fitted in its place You can find out more about artificial eyes from the National Artificial Eye Service. Side effects of treatment Your child's treatment team will discuss any possible side effects of treatment with you. Different treatments have different side effects. Sight loss is one of the biggest worries for parents. Your child's treatment team will do everything they can to avoid your child losing their sight. If your child needs to have one of their eyes removed, the sight in their other eye won't be affected as long as there are no tumours in the important areas for seeing in that eye. Children who lose sight in one eye are usually able to adapt very quickly to using their other eye, without it affecting their home and school life. If both eyes are affected by retinoblastoma, your child will probably have some degree of sight loss, and they may need support either within a mainstream or specialist school. The UK-based retinoblastoma charity, the Childhood Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT), has more information about the side effects of treatment for retinoblastoma. Follow-up Retinoblastoma requires a long period of follow-up tests, which will initially be carried out at one of the specialist retinoblastoma centres. After a period of treatment and observation, the tests will usually take place at your local eye department. Screening for retinoblastoma If you're expecting a baby and you had retinoblastoma yourself as a child, or you have a family history of retinoblastoma, it's important to tell your GP or midwife. This is because in some cases retinoblastoma is an inherited condition and babies considered at increased risk of developing it may be offered screening after the birth. Your GP will be able to refer you to a specialist centre so the appropriate tests can be arranged when your baby is born. Your children's risk will depend on the type of retinoblastoma you or your relative had. The aim of screening is to identify tumours as early as possible so that treatment can be started straight away. Children under five years of age are usually screened by having their eyes examined while under general anaesthetic. This will be carried out at one of the UK's two specialist retinoblastoma centres (The Royal London Hospital or Birmingham Children's Hospital). Your child will need to be screened frequently up until they're five years old. Does my child need screening? The Childhood Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT) says that your child may need to be screened if: you or your partner has had retinoblastoma and you're expecting a baby or you've recently had a baby you or your partner has had retinoblastoma and you have a child under five years of age who hasn't been checked you have a child who's been diagnosed with retinoblastoma and you're expecting a baby, or you have other children under five who haven't been checked your parent (or brother or sister) had retinoblastoma and you have a child under five who hasn't been checked Getting support The specialist teams at the retinoblastoma centres at The Royal London Hospital and Birmingham Children's Hospital have a wealth of knowledge about retinoblastoma. You can discuss any worries or concerns you have with them. They'll also be able to put you in touch with the parents of children who've recently been diagnosed with retinoblastoma and treated for it. The Childhood Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT) can give you further information about retinoblastoma. It also provides help and support to parents and carers of children affected by retinoblastoma, as well as adults who were affected during childhood. You can contact them on 020 7377 5578 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm). You can also call the Cancer Research UK helpline to speak to a cancer nurse who will be able to provide you with information and support. The number is 0808 800 4040 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm). Macmillan operate a similar helpline \u2013 0808 808 00 00 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm).

Common types of eye injury include: blows to the eye \u2013 such as being hit by a fist, elbow or ball scratches and abrasions \u2013 such as from fingernails or tree branches foreign bodies \u2013 such as small pieces of grit, wood or metal getting in the eye penetrating or cutting injuries \u2013 such as cuts from glass or projectiles flung from tools, especially when hammering or using power tools chemical burns \u2013 such as exposure to household cleaning products radiation exposure \u2013 such as exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun or sun lamps Wearing contact lenses incorrectly can also injure your eyes, particularly if they're dirty, don't fit properly or have been worn for too long. What to do Minor irritation or injury to the front of the eye usually doesn't require medical treatment and should clear up within 24 hours. If you experience discomfort, painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen may help. Don't touch or rub your eye, apply pressure to it or wear contact lenses until it's fully healed to prevent further damage. See your GP or optician if you have any concerns about your injury or if it's not better within 24 hours. Flushing your eye If you have loose particles in your eye or your eye has been exposed to chemicals, flush it out with an eyewash or plenty of clean water for at least 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contact lenses, remember to remove them before flushing the eye. You can flush your eyes in the following ways: Sit down and slant your head so the injured eye is lower than the unaffected eye, ideally over a bath or sink, then use a glass or cupped hand to repeatedly pour water across the eye from the bridge of the nose. If both eyes are affected, tilt your head back, keeping it level, and use a glass or cupped hand to repeatedly pour water across both eyes from the bridge of the nose. If you have access to a shower, aim a gentle stream of warm water at your forehead or just above the affected eye while holding the affected eye open. If you're working outside, you can use a garden hose to rinse your eye using a very low flow setting. All eye injuries caused by chemical exposure should be seen by an eye doctor or nurse as soon as possible after flushing. You should also seek immediate medical advice if there are still any foreign bodies in the eye after flushing it. Don't try to remove any objects embedded or stuck in the eye yourself, as this can damage the eye further. These should only be removed by an eye expert. When to seek immediate medical advice You should go immediately to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if you have: persistent or severe eye pain foreign bodies that can't be washed out decreased or double vision flashing lights, spots, halos or shadows in your field of vision blood visible in your eye an irregularly shaped pupil (the black dot at the centre of the eye) pain when exposed to bright light deep cuts around your eye your eye is sticking out of your eye socket You should also go to A&E if your injury was caused by an object flying at speed \u2013 for example, a projectile flung from an angle grinder; a very sharp object, such as glass or a knife; or chemical exposure. Flush your eye for at least 10 to 15 minutes before going. Find your nearest A&E department. Seeing a doctor If you have a serious eye injury, you'll usually be seen by an eye specialist called an ophthalmologist or a specialist eye nurse. You'll be asked how the injury happened, your vision and eye movements will be checked, and the eye will then be examined to determine how severe the injury is. If there's a foreign object in your eye, they may remove it using water or a cotton wool bud. Local anaesthetic drops are used to numb your eye before any objects are removed. You may be prescribed a course of antibiotic ointment or eye drops for a week to help prevent infection. Infections after eye injuries are uncommon, but they can potentially be very serious. If you have a cut on your eye or damage to the bones around your eye, you may need an operation to repair them. Depending on the severity of your injury, your doctor may recommend a follow-up appointment with your GP the next day to check whether your eye is healing. Your GP may refer you to an ophthalmologist for further specialist care if your eye hasn't improved after 48 hours or it's got worse. Preventing eye injuries Many eye injuries are preventable if you take appropriate safety precautions during leisure activities or work \u2013 for example, wearing eye protection when hammering metal and using power tools.  You should also follow instructions on the safe and hygienic use of contact lenses.

If it's painful, there may be a more serious problem.  See your GP for advice if your red eye doesn't start to improve after a few days. Contact your GP or NHS 111 immediately, or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if: you have a painful red eye you have other symptoms, including reduced vision, sensitivity to light, a severe headache and feeling sick you recently injured your eye \u2013 particularly if something has pierced your eye This page aims to give you a better idea of what might be causing your red eye. However, it shouldn't be used to self-diagnose your condition. Always see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment. Common causes of a painless red eye The most likely causes of a painless red eye are minor problems such as conjunctivitis or a burst blood vessel. These conditions don't tend to affect your vision and normally get better within a week or two. Conjunctivitis Conjunctivitis is inflammation (swelling and irritation) of the conjunctiva \u2013 the thin layer of tissue covering the eyeball and inner surfaces of the eyelids. This causes the blood vessels on the eye to swell, making one or both eyes look bloodshot and feel gritty. Other symptoms can include itchiness and watering of the eyes, and a sticky coating on the eyelashes. Conjunctivitis can be caused by an infection, an allergy (for example, to pollen), or an irritant, such as chlorine or dust. Treatment will depend on what is causing the condition. Sometimes no treatment is needed, because it may get better on its own.  Your doctor may recommend: regularly cleaning away any crusting or discharge not wearing contact lenses until the condition passes washing your hands regularly and avoiding sharing pillows or towels to help prevent the condition spreading to others (if it's infectious) antibiotic eye drops for bacterial infections or medications, such as antihistamines for allergies Read more about treating conjunctivitis. Burst blood vessel in the eye Straining, coughing or injuring your eye can sometimes cause a blood vessel to burst on the eye surface, causing a bright red blotch. This is called a subconjunctival haemorrhage. It can look alarming, especially if you're taking medication such as aspirin or warfarin (these reduce the blood's ability to clot, which can exaggerate the redness), but it's not usually serious and should clear up on its own within a few weeks. Common causes of a painful red eye If your red eye is painful or you have other symptoms such as reduced vision, the cause is likely to be one of the below conditions. These conditions can sometimes be serious and could threaten your sight, so they should be assessed by a doctor as soon as possible. Iritis  Iritis is inflammation of the iris (the coloured part of the eye). It's also known as anterior uveitis. As well as a red eye, you may notice that your eye is sensitive to light, your vision is blurred and you have a headache. Often, no cause is identified, although iritis can sometimes be caused by an underlying problem with the immune system or an infection. Iritis usually responds quickly to treatment with steroid medication to reduce the inflammation. It rarely leads to severe problems. Acute glaucoma Acute glaucoma is a serious condition where there is a sudden increase in pressure inside your eye. Your eye will probably be severely red and painful, and you may feel sick and see halos around lights. Your vision may be blurred or cloudy. If your GP thinks you may have acute glaucoma, they will refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) immediately, because the condition could potentially lead to permanent loss of vision if it's not treated quickly. Corneal ulcer (ulcer on the cornea) An ulcer on the cornea (the clear outer layer at the front of the eyeball) is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection. It can cause the eye to become red and sensitive to light, and it can feel like there's something in your eye. Bacterial corneal ulcers are usually seen in people who wear contact lenses. Viral corneal ulcers are often seen in people who frequently get cold sores. If your GP thinks you have a corneal ulcer, they will refer you to an eye specialist for treatment. A scratch to the cornea or particle in the eye A red and painful eye can sometimes be caused by a particle, such as a piece of grit, getting in your eye. If there's something in your eye, your GP or a hospital doctor at an accident and emergency (A&E) department will try to remove it. They will first put anaesthetic eye drops into your eye to numb it and reduce any pain. If the particle has scratched your eye, it may feel a bit uncomfortable when the anaesthetic eye drops have worn off. You may be given antibiotic eye drops or ointment to use for a few days to reduce the risk of infection while it heals. Read more about eye injuries.

It can cause blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated. However, it usually takes several years for diabetic retinopathy to reach a stage where it could threaten your sight. To minimise the risk of this happening, people with diabetes should: ensure they control their blood sugar levels, blood pressure and cholesterol attend diabetic eye screening appointments \u2013 annual screening is offered to all people with diabetes aged 12 and over to pick up and treat any problems early on This page covers: How diabetes can affect the eyes Am I at risk of diabetic retinopathy? Symptoms of diabetic retinopathy Diabetic eye screening Reduce your risk of diabetic retinopathy Treatments for diabetic retinopathy How diabetes can affect the eyes The retina is the light-sensitive layer of cells at the back of the eye that converts light into electrical signals. The signals are sent to the brain and the brain turns them into the images you see. The retina needs a constant supply of blood, which it receives through a network of tiny blood vessels. Over time, a persistently high blood sugar level can damage these blood vessels in three main stages: tiny bulges develop in the blood vessels, which may bleed slightly but don\u2019t usually affect your vision \u2013 this is known as background retinopathy more severe and widespread changes affect the blood vessels, including more significant bleeding into the eye \u2013 this is known as pre-proliferative retinopathy scar tissue and new blood vessels, which are weak and bleed easily, develop on the retina \u2013 this is known as proliferative retinopathy and it can result in some loss of vision However, if a problem with your eyes is picked up early, lifestyle changes and\/or treatment can stop it getting worse. Read about the stages of diabetic retinopathy. Am I at risk of diabetic retinopathy? Anyone with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes is potentially at risk of developing diabetic retinopathy. You're at a greater risk if you: have had diabetes for a long time have a persistently high blood sugar (blood glucose) level have high blood pressure have high cholesterol are pregnant are of Asian or Afro-Caribbean background By keeping your blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control, you can reduce your chances of developing diabetic retinopathy. Symptoms of diabetic retinopathy You won't usually notice diabetic retinopathy in the early stages, as it doesn't tend to have any obvious symptoms until it's more advanced. However, early signs of the condition can be picked up by taking photographs of the eyes during diabetic eye screening. Contact your GP or diabetes care team immediately if you experience: gradually worsening vision sudden vision loss shapes floating in your field of vision (floaters) blurred or patchy vision eye pain or redness These symptoms don't necessarily mean you have diabetic retinopathy, but it's important to get them checked out. Don't wait until your next screening appointment. Diabetic eye screening Everyone with diabetes who is 12 years old or over is invited for eye screening once a year. Screening is offered because: diabetic retinopathy doesn't tend to cause any symptoms in the early stages the condition can cause permanent blindness if not diagnosed and treated promptly screening can detect problems in your eyes before they start to affect your vision if problems are caught early, treatment can help prevent or reduce vision loss The screening test involves examining the back of the eyes and taking photographs. Depending on your result, you may be advised to return for another appointment a year later, attend more regular appointments, or discuss treatment options with a specialist. Read more about diabetic eye screening. Reduce your risk of diabetic retinopathy You can reduce your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, or help prevent it getting worse, by: controlling your blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels taking your diabetes medication as prescribed attending all your screening appointments getting medical advice quickly if you notice any changes to your vision maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy, balanced diet, exercising regularly and stopping smoking Read more about how to prevent diabetic retinopathy. Treatments for diabetic retinopathy Treatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk. If the condition hasn't reached this stage, the above advice on managing your diabetes is recommended. The main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are: laser treatment injections of medication into your eyes an operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes Read more about the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.

Although serious vision problems during childhood are rare, early testing ensures that any problems are picked up and managed as early as possible. This page covers: Why eye tests are important When will my child's eyes be checked? What eye tests may be carried out? Causes of eye problems in babies and children Spotting signs of an eye problem Why eye tests are important Routine eye tests offered soon after birth can detect some eye problems immediately, and tests offered later on can help identify any problems that were missed or develop as your child gets older. Children may not realise they have a vision problem, so without routine tests there is a risk that any problems could go undiagnosed for months or years. It's important for eye problems to be identified as early as possible, because they can have a significant impact on a child's development and education. Eye problems are often much easier to treat if detected while a child's vision is still developing (usually up to about seven or eight years of age). An early diagnosis will help to ensure that you and your child have access to any special support services you may need. When will my child's eyes be checked? Your child's eyes may be checked: within 72 hours of birth \u2013 this is known as the newborn physical examination and it can be used to check for obvious physical problems between six and eight weeks old \u2013 this is a follow-up physical examination to check for any obvious problems that weren't detected soon after birth at around one year old or between two and two-and-a-half years old \u2013 you may be asked whether you have any concerns about your child's eyesight as part of a review of your child's health and development; eye tests can be arranged, if necessary at around four or five years old \u2013 some children will have an eye test when they start school, although this varies, depending on where you live It's also recommended that children have regular eye tests at least once every two years. These tests can be done at a high street opticians and are free for all children under 16 years old (and those under 19 years old in full-time education). Speak to your GP or health visitor if you have any concerns about your child's vision at any stage (see spotting vision problems below). What eye tests may be carried out? A number of tests may be carried out to check for vision or eye problems in babies and children. Some of these are described below. The red reflex test The red reflex test is usually carried out alongside a general examination of your baby's eyes, as part of newborn checks. It involves using an instrument called an ophthalmoscope, which magnifies the eyes and produces a light that allows the eyes to be examined clearly. When light is shone into your baby's eyes, a red reflection should be seen as it's reflected back. If a white reflection is seen, it could be a sign of an eye problem. The pupil reflex test The pupil reflex test involves shining a light into each of your baby\u2019s eyes to check how their pupils (black dots at the centre of the eyes) react to light. Your baby's pupils should automatically shrink in response to the light. If they don't, it could be a sign of a problem with their eyes. Attention to visual objects This is a simple test to check whether a newborn baby pays attention to visual objects. A midwife or doctor will try to catch your baby's attention with an interesting object. They then move it to see if the child's eyes follow. These sorts of tests can also be used to check the eyesight of older babies and young children who are not yet able to speak. If your child can speak, but is not yet able to recognise letters, pictures may be used instead of objects. Snellen and LogMAR charts When your child can recognise or match letters, their vision is tested using charts that have rows of letters and numbers of decreasing sizes. Your child will be asked to read out or match the letters they can see from a specific distance. These charts are called Snellen or LogMAR charts. For younger children, a similar test using pictures or symbols may be carried out instead. Range of movement tests To test the range of movement of each eye, a child's attention will be drawn to an interesting object, which is then moved to eight different positions: up, down, left, right, and halfway between each of these points. This tests how well the eye muscles work. Refraction test A refraction test is carried out by an optometrist at a high street opticians and is used to determine if your child needs glasses and what prescription they need. Before the test, your child may be given special eye drops that widen their pupils, so the back of their eyes can be examined more clearly. Your child will be asked to look at a light, or read letters on a chart if they're old enough, while different lenses are placed in front of their eyes. Colour vision deficiency test Colour vision deficiency tests, also known as colour blindness tests, are usually carried out in older children if a problem is suspected. One of the tests used to check for colour blindness is the Ishihara test. This involves looking at images that are made up of dots in two different colours. If a child's colour vision is normal, they'll be able to recognise a letter or number within the image. A child who can't tell the difference between two colours won't be able to see the number or letter, which means they may have a colour vision problem. Read more about diagnosing colour vision deficiency. Causes of eye problems in babies and children There are a number of different eye problems affecting babies and children that can be detected during eye tests, including: childhood cataracts \u2013 cloudy patches in the lens of the eye that are present from birth lazy eye (amblyopia) \u2013 where the vision in one eye does not develop properly squint (strabismus) \u2013 where the eyes look in different directions short-sightedness (myopia) \u2013 where distant objects appear blurred, while close objects can be seen clearly long-sightedness (hyperopia) \u2013 where you can see distant objects clearly, but nearby objects are out of focus astigmatism \u2013 where the cornea (transparent layer at the front of the eye) is not perfectly curved colour vision deficiency (colour blindness) \u2013 difficulty seeing colours or distinguishing between different colours; this is more common in boys than girls Spotting signs of an eye problem Although your child should have regular eye tests as they grow up, it's still important to look out for signs of any problems and seek advice if you have any concerns. For babies, the checklist in your baby's personal child health record (red book) can be used to help you check if your child's vision is developing normally. In older children, signs of a possible eye problem can include: the eyes not pointing in the same direction complaining of headaches or eye strain problems reading \u2013 for example, they may need to hold books close to their face and they may lose their place regularly problems with hand-eye co-ordination \u2013 for example, they may struggle to play ball games being unusually clumsy regularly rubbing their eyes   Speak to your GP or health visitor if you have any concerns about your child's eyes or vision. They can have an eye test at any age. Page last reviewed: 30\/06\/2015 Next review due: 30\/06\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Sometimes, a black eye can occur after cosmetic surgery to the face, such as a facelift or a nose operation. The area around the eye turns bluish or purple because tiny blood vessels under the skin burst and blood leaks out into surrounding soft tissue. Your skin may be painful and swollen and may make it difficult to fully open your eye. Your vision may also be temporarily blurred and you may have a headache. What to do if you have a black eye A black eye is not usually serious and you can usually look after it at home if there are no signs of a severe injury (see below). After a few days, the swelling around your eye will start to go down and the bruise will turn brownish-yellow before eventually fading. Like any other bruise, a black eye will usually take about a week or two to heal completely. Self-care You can normally help reduce the symptoms of a black eye. Gently apply an ice pack to the skin around your eye as soon as possible after the injury. You can use a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel. The cold will numb the pain and relieve the swelling. During the first day, you should apply the ice pack to your eye for 15-20 minutes an hour every hour. Painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, can be used to help relieve pain. Avoid using aspirin (unless your doctor advises you to take it) because it can make bleeding worse. Children under 16 should never be given aspirin. See your GP if the pain or swelling is severe or doesn't go away, or the affected area is warm, red or leaking pus (these may be signs of infection). When to go to A&E Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately if: you have hit your head and have two black eyes (this suggests a type of head injury known as a basilar skull fracture) you lost consciousness at the time of the blow to your head you have double vision or loss of vision you have other symptoms of a severe head injury, such as memory loss, a severe or persistent headache, drowsiness, seizures (fits), or vomiting you cannot move your eye you think something has pierced your eye, or there is something stuck in it your eye is cut or there is blood in your eye you have other signs of a serious eye injury, such as an irregularly shaped pupil (the black dot at the centre of the eye), pain when exposed to bright light, or flashing lights, spots, halos or shadows in your field of vision you are taking blood-thinning medication, such as aspirin, or you have a bleeding disorder, such as haemophilia Any of these situations could mean you have a serious injury and need to be assessed as soon as possible.

If it's picked up early, retinoblastoma can often be successfully treated (children treated for retinoblastoma diagnosed at an early stage have a survival rate of more than 95%). Retinoblastoma can either affect one or both eyes. If it affects both eyes, it's usually diagnosed before a child is one year old. If it affects one eye, it tends to be diagnosed later (between the ages of two and three). This page covers: Symptoms of retinoblastoma Causes of retinoblastoma  Diagnosing retinoblastoma Treating retinoblastoma Screening for retinoblastoma Getting support Signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma Signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma include: an unusual white reflection in the pupil \u2013 this may be apparent in photos where only the healthy eye appears red from the flash, or you may notice it in a dark or artificially lit room a squint a change in the colour of the iris \u2013 in one eye or sometimes only in one area of the eye  a red or inflamed eye \u2013 though your child won't usually complain of any pain poor vision \u2013 your child may not focus on faces or objects, or they may not be able to control their eye movements (this is more common when both eyes are affected); they may say that they can't see as well as they used to These symptoms may be caused by something other than retinoblastoma. However, you should get them checked by your GP as soon as possible. It's unusual for retinoblastoma to progress unnoticed beyond the age of five. Signs in older children include the eye appearing red, sore or swollen, and some loss of vision in the affected eye. What causes retinoblastoma? Retinoblastoma is cancer of the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive lining at the back of the eye. During the early stages of a baby's development, retinal eye cells grow very quickly and then stop growing. However, in rare cases, one or more cells continue to grow and form a cancer called retinoblastoma. In about 4 out of 10 (40%) of cases, retinoblastoma is caused by a faulty gene, which often affects both eyes (bilateral). The faulty gene may be inherited from a parent, or a change to the gene (mutation) may occur at an early stage of the child's development in the womb. It's not known what causes the remaining 60% of retinoblastoma cases. In these cases, there's no faulty gene and only one eye is affected (unilateral). Around 50 to 60 children are diagnosed with retinoblastoma in the UK each year. Diagnosing retinoblastoma Your GP will carry out a 'red reflex test' in a darkened room using an ophthalmoscope (a magnifying instrument with a light at one end). When a light is shone into your child's eyes, your GP will see a red reflection if the retina is normal. If the reflection is white, it may be a sign of an eye condition such as cataracts, retinal detachment or retinoblastoma. In this case, your child will be urgently referred (within two weeks) to an eye specialist for further investigation. The eye specialist (ophthalmologist) will examine your child's eyes, and they may carry out another red reflex test. Eye drops will be used to increase the size of your child's pupils, allowing a clear view of the retina at the back of the eye. An ultrasound scan is also sometimes used to help diagnose retinoblastoma. This is a painless procedure where gel is rubbed on the outside of the eyelid and a small ultrasound probe is placed on the eyelid, which scans the eye. After these investigations, if the eye specialist thinks your child has retinoblastoma they'll refer them to one of two specialist retinoblastoma treatment centres, either at The Royal London Hospital (RLH) or the Birmingham Children's Hospital (BCH). Your child's appointment should be within a week of being seen at your local eye clinic. At the specialist centre, your child will need to have a general anaesthetic so their eyes can be thoroughly examined and a diagnosis of retinoblastoma can be confirmed or ruled out. Treating retinoblastoma Your child will be treated by a specialist retinoblastoma team at either the Royal London Hospital or Birmingham Children's Hospital. However, if your child needs chemotherapy, it will usually be carried out at a local children's cancer centre and overseen by the retinoblastoma team at one of the two specialist hospitals. The recommended treatment for retinoblastoma will depend on the stage of the tumour which can either be: intraocular \u2013 where the cancer is completely within the eye extraocular \u2013 where the cancer spreads beyond the eye to the surrounding tissue, or to another part of the body (this is rarely seen in the UK)  Most cases of retinoblastoma (9 out 10) are detected early and successfully treated before the cancer spreads outside the eyeball. If the cancer has spread beyond the eye it will be more difficult to treat. However, this is rare as the condition is usually identified well before it reaches this stage. Depending on the size and position of the tumour, your child's specialist will be able to accurately stage the cancer into one of a number of categories (A to E). Visit the American Cancer Society to read more about how retinoblastoma is staged. Treating small tumours There are two possible treatment options for treating small tumours contained within the eye. These are: laser treatment to the eye (photocoagulation or thermotherapy) freezing the tumour (cryotherapy) These treatments are carried out under general anaesthetic, so your child will be unconscious and won't feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure. In some cases, chemotherapy (see below) may be needed before or after these treatments. Treating larger tumours Larger tumours will be treated with one or a combination of the following treatments: brachytherapy \u2013 if the tumour isn't too large, small radioactive plates called plaques are stitched over the tumour and left in place for a few days to destroy the tumour, before being removed; radiotherapy to the whole eye may be recommended for larger tumours that haven't responded to other treatment methods chemotherapy \u2013 may be used to shrink the tumour before one of the above treatments are used, or it may be recommended if there's a chance of the cancer spreading; in some cases, chemotherapy medication can be delivered directly to the eye surgery to remove the eye \u2013 is often necessary for very large tumours where there's no sight from the eye; if your child needs to have their eye removed, they'll have an artificial eye fitted in its place You can find out more about artificial eyes from the National Artificial Eye Service. Side effects of treatment Your child's treatment team will discuss any possible side effects of treatment with you. Different treatments have different side effects. Sight loss is one of the biggest worries for parents. Your child's treatment team will do everything they can to avoid your child losing their sight. If your child needs to have one of their eyes removed, the sight in their other eye won't be affected as long as there are no tumours in the important areas for seeing in that eye. Children who lose sight in one eye are usually able to adapt very quickly to using their other eye, without it affecting their home and school life. If both eyes are affected by retinoblastoma, your child will probably have some degree of sight loss, and they may need support either within a mainstream or specialist school. The UK-based retinoblastoma charity, the Childhood Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT), has more information about the side effects of treatment for retinoblastoma. Follow-up Retinoblastoma requires a long period of follow-up tests, which will initially be carried out at one of the specialist retinoblastoma centres. After a period of treatment and observation, the tests will usually take place at your local eye department. Screening for retinoblastoma If you're expecting a baby and you had retinoblastoma yourself as a child, or you have a family history of retinoblastoma, it's important to tell your GP or midwife. This is because in some cases retinoblastoma is an inherited condition and babies considered at increased risk of developing it may be offered screening after the birth. Your GP will be able to refer you to a specialist centre so the appropriate tests can be arranged when your baby is born. Your children's risk will depend on the type of retinoblastoma you or your relative had. The aim of screening is to identify tumours as early as possible so that treatment can be started straight away. Children under five years of age are usually screened by having their eyes examined while under general anaesthetic. This will be carried out at one of the UK's two specialist retinoblastoma centres (The Royal London Hospital or Birmingham Children's Hospital). Your child will need to be screened frequently up until they're five years old. Does my child need screening? The Childhood Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT) says that your child may need to be screened if: you or your partner has had retinoblastoma and you're expecting a baby or you've recently had a baby you or your partner has had retinoblastoma and you have a child under five years of age who hasn't been checked you have a child who's been diagnosed with retinoblastoma and you're expecting a baby, or you have other children under five who haven't been checked your parent (or brother or sister) had retinoblastoma and you have a child under five who hasn't been checked Getting support The specialist teams at the retinoblastoma centres at The Royal London Hospital and Birmingham Children's Hospital have a wealth of knowledge about retinoblastoma. You can discuss any worries or concerns you have with them. They'll also be able to put you in touch with the parents of children who've recently been diagnosed with retinoblastoma and treated for it. The Childhood Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT) can give you further information about retinoblastoma. It also provides help and support to parents and carers of children affected by retinoblastoma, as well as adults who were affected during childhood. You can contact them on 020 7377 5578 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm). You can also call the Cancer Research UK helpline to speak to a cancer nurse who will be able to provide you with information and support. The number is 0808 800 4040 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm). Macmillan operate a similar helpline \u2013 0808 808 00 00 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm).

Contact your GP or NHS 111 immediately, or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if you also have pain in or around your eye or any loss of vision. The information below should give you an idea of what might be wrong, although it shouldn't be used to self-diagnose your condition. It covers possible causes for the following eyelid problems, plus specific advice about what to do. You can find out about: swollen eyelids or eyelid cysts   itchy, flaky or sticky eyelids  lumps on or around the eyelids  hooded or droopy upper eyelids  rolling outwards of the lower eyelids (ectropion)  rolling inwards of the eyelids (entropion)  yellow plaques on the eyelids  excessive blinking or uncontrollable closure of the eyelids  Swollen eyelid or eyelid cyst It's quite common for the upper or lower eyelid to become swollen because of a meibomian cyst (also called a chalazion). This occurs when the glands in the eyelid become blocked. These cysts vary in size, from barely visible to the size of a grape. They usually take weeks to develop. They're not usually painful, but can become red and painful if infected. The cysts can come and go by themselves, although they may take a few months to get better. You can help them heal by holding a clean flannel warmed in hot water to the closed eye for five minutes, and repeating this three to four times a day for up to four weeks. Speak to your GP if you have a cyst that doesn't clear up after a month. They can refer you to have it drained through a small incision (cut). This is a simple procedure carried out under local anaesthetic (your eye area will be numbed). It takes just a few minutes and rarely leaves a scar. Also see your GP if the cyst becomes infected because you may need to take antibiotics to prevent a deep lid infection (cellulitis). Another common cause of a swelling on the eyelid is a stye. A stye is a minor infection of the base of an eyelash that usually clears up on its own in a week or two. Holding a warm flannel to it regularly may help it heal faster. Read more about treating styes. Other causes of lid swelling include an allergic reaction and shingles on the face and eye (usually with a rash), but these are less common. Itchy, flaky or sticky eyelids Itchy and flaky eyelids are usually caused by an inflamed eyelid edge (blepharitis) or dry eye. Your eyelids may also stick together and be difficult to open, particularly when you wake up. These conditions can be irritating, but are rarely serious. You can reduce the irritation by keeping the eyelids clean and using artificial tears if your eyes are dry. Read about treating blepharitis and treating dry eyes. Contact dermatitis is another possible cause of itchy or flaky eyelids. This is a type of eczema triggered when the skin comes into contact with something you are irritated by or allergic to, such as make-up. The condition usually clears up after you stop using the substance your skin is reacting to. Sticky eyelids along with red and watering eyes can be caused by conjunctivitis, which is when an infection, allergy or irritant causes the front of the eye to become inflamed. This can get better on its own, although your GP may be able to prescribe medication to treat the underlying cause. Read more about treating conjunctivitis. Lumps on or around the eyelids Just like anywhere else on the skin, lumps can occur on or around the eyelids. Many lumps are simple cysts or styes (see above). However, occasionally a lump can be a sign of a more serious condition such as skin cancer and may need to be removed. See your GP if you're worried about a lump on or around your eyelids. Most skin cancers are basal cell carcinomas, which very rarely spread to other parts of the body. These often appear as a red or pink lump containing small blood vessels, although they can be pearly-white or \"waxy\" looking. Sometimes they may bleed. Less commonly, the lump may be a squamous cell carcinoma, which is more serious as there\u2019s a small risk it could spread to other parts of the body. These usually look like an ulcer with a red base and a scaly and crusted surface. You may also lose eyelashes where the lump is growing. In rare cases, the lump could be a sign of a very serious type of skin cancer called melanoma that can spread to other parts of the body and can be very dangerous. A lump is more likely to be melanoma if it's an irregular shape, dark or changing in colour, and getting a lot bigger over time. Hooded or droopy upper eyelids As you get older, it's quite common to have excess skin above the upper eyelids that can overhang and block your vision. This is called dermatochalasis. If it affects your vision, surgery may be considered to remove the excess skin (blepharoplasty). However, this operation isn\u2019t routinely funded on the NHS so your doctor would need to submit a funding request for this to be considered. If the edge of your upper lid droops down over your eye, it's called ptosis. This is usually age-related and develops slowly. Surgery may be needed if the edge of the lid droops so much your vision is affected. In rare cases, ptosis isn't related to age and may be caused by serious conditions such as myasthenia gravis or a brain tumour. In these cases, it's likely there would be other symptoms too. See your GP immediately if ptosis comes on rapidly, over days or weeks, or if it's associated with other symptoms, such as a headache, loss of vision or a change in the size of the pupil (the black dot at the centre of the eye). Lower eyelid that rolls outwards (ectropion)  As you get older, one or both lower eyelids can sometimes droop away from the eye and turn outwards. This is known as an ectropion. The drooping eyelid can disrupt the normal production of tears, which can cause your eye to become dry, red and irritated. Treatment may not be needed in mild cases, although drops or ointment may help make your eye more comfortable. Sometimes a minor operation is needed to correct the position of the eyelid. Read more about treating ectropion. Eyelids that roll inwards (entropion) Entropion is where the eyelid rolls inwards. It usually affects the lower lids, but it can also affect the upper lids. Like ectropion, this is often age-related. Entropion usually causes an uncomfortable watery eye because the lashes irritate the front of the eye (cornea). If this is mild, using eyedrops may be enough to protect the eye and keep you comfortable. Severe entropion can be painful and cause vision loss by damaging the cornea. Occasionally, a corneal ulcer can form and become infected. Surgery may be needed to correct entropion if it's posing a risk to the health of your eye or is causing considerable discomfort. This is carried out under local anaesthetic. If you have entropion, you should discuss your treatment options with your GP. Consult your GP immediately if your eye becomes painful and red and your vision is affected. Yellow plaques on the eyelids Flat yellow patches (plaques) over the upper or lower eyelids are called xanthelasma.  Although these plaques are harmless, they indicate you have high cholesterol. See your GP because you may be at risk of developing cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks and strokes. Making changes to your diet and taking medication may be recommended to reduce your cholesterol level and reduce your risk of serious problems in the future, although these may not improve the plaques. If you're bothered by the appearance of the plaques, it may be possible for them to be surgically removed or treated with a laser. However, this isn't normally funded on the NHS. Excessive blinking or uncontrollable closure of the eyelids It's quite common and normal for the eyelid to flicker or twitch occasionally, particularly when you're tired. It's more unusual to have repeated spasms of excessive blinking and involuntary closure of one or both eyes. This is a type of dystonia (a movement disorder that causes muscle spasms and contractions) known as blepharospasm. Each spasm can last for a few seconds to a few minutes. The exact cause of blepharospasm is unknown. However, the blinking and closure can be triggered by bright light, stress or tiredness. Severe blepharospasm can be very disabling and embarrassing. However, an effective treatment is available. It involves having small injections of botulinum toxin (such as Botox) into the face to relax the muscles controlling the eyelids. In some cases, your GP may consider referring you to a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nerves) for further investigation.

The aim is to improve hooded or droopy eyelids or eye bags. Before you go ahead, be sure about your reasons for wanting eyelid surgery. Bear in mind the cost, the risks, and the fact the results can't be guaranteed.  It's a good idea to discuss your plans with your GP first. There might be a medical condition affecting your eyelids or a reason why the operation isn't appropriate for you. You can also read Is cosmetic surgery right for me? before making your decision. Read on to find out: How much does eyelid surgery cost?  Where do I go?  What does it involve?  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems  More information  How much does it cost?  In the UK, a blepharoplasty may cost anywhere between £2,000 and £6,000. You should also factor in the cost of any consultations, further surgery or follow-up care that may be needed. Where do I go? If you're looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform eyelid surgery.  All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC. The CQC publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. Also, research the surgeon or ophthalmologist who is going to carry out the surgery. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor's fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many operations they've performed where there have been complications what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? A blepharoplasty can be done under local anaesthetic with sedation or under general anaesthetic. The surgeon would need to know about any medicine you may be taking to reduce your risk of blood clots, such as aspirin or warfarin. Surgery on the upper eyelids generally involves: making a cut (incision) along the eyelid crease in the natural skin fold of the eyelid removing excess skin, fat or muscle closing up the incision \u2013 the scar will be hidden in the natural fold of the eyelid Surgery on the lower eyelids generally involves: making an incision either just below the lower lashes or on the inside of the eyelid moving or removing fat from the bags under the eyes, and sometimes also a small amount of skin supporting the muscles and tendon of the eyelid if necessary The surgeon will normally apply thin, sticky strips called suture strips to support the eyelids after surgery. These are usually removed up to a week later. An upper blepharoplasty may take about one hour. Surgery on the lower lid may take up to two hours. Most patients can go home the same day. Recovery It's advisable to take about a week off work to recover from eyelid surgery. It may be obvious for a little longer than a week that you've just had eyelid surgery. You won't be able to drive for a number of days after the operation. Bruises, scars and redness may take several weeks to fade. You probably need to: prop your head up with pillows for a couple of days when resting to reduce the swelling gently clean your eyelids using prescribed ointment or eyedrops hold a cold pack to your eye for a few days \u2013 try a pack of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from the sun and wind take paracetamol or another prescribed painkiller to relieve any mild pain You should avoid: strenuous activity and swimming for a few days smoking contact lenses and rubbing the eyes Side effects to expect It's common after eyelid surgery to temporarily have: puffy, numb eyelids that are difficult to close at night irritated, sensitive or watery eyes \u2013 this may last a few weeks bruising that looks like a black eye pink scars \u2013 these eventually fade to almost be invisible What could go wrong Eyelid surgery can occasionally result in:  temporary blurred or double vision your eyes looking slightly asymmetrical a pool of blood collecting under the skin (haematoma) \u2013 this usually disappears on its own after a few weeks noticeable scarring Rarely, it can result in more serious problems, including:  injury to eye muscles the lower eyelid drooping away from the eye and turning outwards (ectropion) the lower eyelid becoming pulled down and showing the white of the eye below the iris (eyelid retraction) blindness \u2013 this is extremely rare Also, any type of operation carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding developing a blood clot in a vein infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, patients find the desired effect wasn't achieved and feel they need another operation. What to do if you have problems  Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong, and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms. If you're not happy with the results, or you think the procedure wasn't carried out properly, you should take up the matter with the surgeon who treated you. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC).
