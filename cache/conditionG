It means the body can\u2019t process certain amino acids (\"building blocks\" of protein), causing a harmful build-up of substances in the blood and urine. Normally, our bodies break down protein foods like meat and fish into amino acids. Any amino acids that aren't needed are usually broken down and removed from the body. Babies with GA1 are unable to break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan. Normally, these amino acids are broken down into a substance called glutaric acid, which is then converted into energy. Babies with GA1 don\u2019t have the enzyme that breaks down glutaric acid, leading to a harmfully high level of this and other substances in the body. Diagnosing GA1 At around five days old, babies are now offered newborn blood spot screening to check if they have GA1. This involves pricking your baby\u2019s heel to collect drops of blood to test. If GA1 is diagnosed, treatment can be given straight away to reduce the risk of serious complications. With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, the majority of children with GA1 are able to live normal, healthy lives. However, treatment for GA1 must be continued for life. Without treatment, severe and life-threatening symptoms can develop, including seizures (fits) or falling into a coma. Some children with untreated GA1 are also at risk of brain damage, which can affect muscle movement. This may lead to problems with walking, talking and swallowing. Around 1 in 100,000 children worldwide are thought to be affected by GA1. Symptoms of GA1 Symptoms of GA1 usually don\u2019t appear until a few months after birth, although some babies are born with a larger-than-average head (macrocephaly). Children with GA1 may develop some floppiness or weakness in their muscles (hypotonia) during their first year and there\u2019s a risk of developing bleeding around their brain (subdural haematoma). In rarer cases, bleeding can develop around the back of the eyes (retinal haemorrhage). Metabolic crisis Children with GA1 may have episodes known as a metabolic crisis, sometimes early in their life. Symptoms of a metabolic crisis include: poor feeding or loss of appetite lack of energy abnormal movements vomiting irritability breathing difficulties It\u2019s important to get medical help immediately if your baby develops symptoms of a metabolic crisis. Your doctor will give you advice to help recognise the signs. In some cases, a metabolic crisis may be triggered later in childhood by an infection or illness. The hospital should provide you with emergency treatment instructions to follow if your child is ill, which helps to prevent these symptoms developing. Treating GA1 Diet Children diagnosed with GA1 are referred to a specialist metabolic dietitian and given a low-protein diet. This is tailored to reduce the amount of amino acids your baby receives, especially lysine and tryptophan. High-protein foods need to be limited, including: meat fish cheese eggs pulses nuts Your dietitian will provide detailed advice and guidance, as your baby still needs some of these foods for healthy growth and development. Breastfeeding and baby milk also need to be monitored and measured, as advised by your dietitian. Regular baby milk contains the amino acids that need to be restricted, so a special formula is used instead. This contains all the vitamins, minerals and other amino acids your baby needs. People with GA1 may need to follow a restricted protein diet for the rest of their life to reduce their risk of a metabolic crisis. As your child gets older, they\u2019ll need to learn how to control their diet and stay in contact with a dietitian for advice and monitoring. Medication Your child will be prescribed a medication called L-carnitine, which helps to clear some of the excess glutaric acid. L-carnitine is given as a tablet and needs to be taken regularly, as directed by your doctor. Emergency treatment If your baby develops an infection, such as a high temperature or cold, their risk of having a metabolic crisis increases. It\u2019s possible to reduce the risk by changing to an emergency diet while they\u2019re ill. Your dietitian will provide detailed instructions, but the aim is to replace milk and food containing protein with special high-sugar drinks. Medication should still be taken as normal. Your dietitian may provide you with a feeding tube (nasogastric tube) and show you how to use it safely. This can be useful in an emergency if your baby isn\u2019t feeding well while they are ill. If your baby can\u2019t keep down their emergency feeds, or develops repeated diarrhoea, you should contact the metabolic team at the hospital to let them know you\u2019re heading straight to the accident and emergency (A&E) department. You should also have been provided with a leaflet to bring with you in case of an emergency, in case the doctors haven\u2019t seen GA1 before. Once in hospital, your baby can be monitored and treated with intravenous fluids (given directly into a vein). You should also take your baby to hospital if they develop symptoms of a metabolic crisis, such as irritability, loss of energy or breathing difficulties. How GA1 is inherited The genetic cause (mutation) of GA1 is passed on by the parents, who usually don\u2019t have any symptoms of the condition. The way this mutation is passed on is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. This means a baby needs to receive two copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition \u2013 one from their mother and one from their father. If the baby only receives one mutated gene, they\u2019ll just be a carrier of GA1. If you\u2019re a carrier of the affected gene and you have a baby with a partner who\u2019s also a carrier, your baby has: a 25% chance of developing the condition a 50% chance of being a carrier of GA1 a 25% chance of receiving a pair of normal genes Although it\u2019s not possible to prevent GA1, it\u2019s important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition. Any further children you have can be tested for the condition as soon as possible and given appropriate treatment. You may also wish to consider genetic counselling for support, information and advice about genetic conditions. Information about you If you or your child has GA1, your clinical team will pass information about you\/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Everyone has feelings of anxiety at some point in their life \u2013 for example, you may feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam, or having a medical test or job interview. During times like these, feeling anxious can be perfectly normal. However, some people find it hard to control their worries. Their feelings of anxiety are more constant and can often affect their daily lives. Anxiety is the main symptom of several conditions, including: panic disorder phobias \u2013 such as agoraphobia or claustrophobia  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) social anxiety disorder (social phobia) However, the information in this section is about a specific condition called generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is a long-term condition that causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event.  People with GAD feel anxious most days and often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed. As soon as one anxious thought is resolved, another may appear about a different issue. GAD can cause both psychological (mental) and physical symptoms. These vary from person to person, but can include: feeling restless or worried having trouble concentrating or sleeping dizziness or heart palpitations Read about the symptoms of GAD. When to see your GP Although feelings of anxiety at certain times are completely normal, see your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or causing you distress. Your GP will ask about your symptoms and your worries, fears and emotions to find out if you could have GAD. Read more about diagnosing GAD. What causes GAD? The exact cause of GAD isn't fully understood, although it's likely that a combination of several factors plays a role. Research has suggested that these may include: overactivity in areas of the brain involved in emotions and behaviour an imbalance of the brain chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline, which are involved in the control and regulation of mood the genes you inherit from your parents \u2013 you're estimated to be five times more likely to develop GAD if you have a close relative with the condition having a history of stressful or traumatic experiences, such as domestic violence, child abuse or bullying having a painful long-term health condition, such as arthritis having a history of drug or alcohol misuse However, many people develop GAD for no apparent reason. Who is affected? GAD is a common condition, estimated to affect up to 5% of the UK population. Slightly more women are affected than men, and the condition is more common in people from the ages of 35 to 59. How GAD is treated GAD can have a significant effect on your daily life, but several different treatments are available that can ease your symptoms. These include: psychological therapy \u2013 such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) medication \u2013 such as a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) There are also many things you can do yourself to help reduce your anxiety, such as:  going on a self-help course exercising regularly stopping smoking cutting down on the amount of alcohol and caffeine you drink Read how stopping smoking can improve your anxiety. With treatment, many people are able to control their anxiety levels. However, some treatments may need to be continued for a long time and there may be periods when your symptoms worsen.

Around 800 people in the UK are diagnosed with the condition each year. There are a number of different types of gallbladder cancer, depending on the cells affected. Over 85% of gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinoma, which means the cancer started in the gland cells lining the gallbladder. Cancer that starts in the skin-like cells that line the gallbladder is known as squamous cell cancer. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the different types of gallbladder cancer. Cancer of the gallbladder is more common in women than men, with around 7 out of 10 cases diagnosed in women. It's also more common in older people, particularly those over 70 years of age. The gallbladder The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ that's located underneath the liver. It's main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. Bile is a liquid produced by the liver that helps to digest fats. It passes from the liver through a series of channels (bile ducts) into the gallbladder, where it's stored. Over time, bile becomes more concentrated, which makes it better at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed. The gallbladder is a useful but not essential organ, which can be safely removed without interfering with your ability to digest food. Symptoms of gallbladder cancer In the early stages, gallbladder cancer doesn't cause symptoms, which means it could be at an advanced stage by the time it's diagnosed. Symptoms that occur at a later stage can include: abdominal (stomach) pain feeling sick jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) These symptoms could be linked to a number of conditions and may not be related to gallbladder cancer. However, if you have these symptoms, you should visit your GP so they can investigate what's causing them. Other possible symptoms of gallbladder cancer can include loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss and a swollen stomach. What causes gallbladder cancer? In gallbladder cancer, abnormal cells grow within the gallbladder. It's not known why this happens, but certain things are thought to increase your chances of developing the condition. Gallbladder cancer is more common in older people, and your chances of developing it increase with age. In the UK, most cases occur in people over the age of 70. Lifestyle factors \u2013 such as obesity, smoking and an unhealthy diet \u2013 are believed to increase the risk of gallbladder cancer. However, there's not enough evidence to show a firm link between diet and gallbladder cancer. There are also a number of conditions that can increase your chances of developing gallbladder cancer. For example, gallstones, cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) and diabetes have been closely linked to the condition. If you have a family history of gallstones, cholecystitis, or gallbladder cancer, you're more likely to develop these conditions yourself. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risks and causes of gallbladder cancer. Diagnosing gallbladder cancer Your GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms. If they suspect gallbladder cancer, they may refer you to a specialist, usually a gastroenterologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions of the digestive system). The specialist will ask about your medical history and check to see whether the lymph glands in your neck and groin are swollen. You may also have some initial tests, including: blood tests an ultrasound scan a computerised tomography (CT) scan If these tests reveal anything abnormal in or around your gallbladder, further tests may be arranged to help confirm whether you have gallbladder cancer. These may include: an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) biopsy and fine needle aspiration (FNA) The Cancer Research UK website has more information about tests for gallbladder cancer. Treating gallbladder cancer The main treatment for gallbladder cancer is surgery to remove the gallbladder and possibly some of the surrounding tissue. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are also sometimes used, either on their own or in combination with surgery. The treatment programme that's most suitable for you will depend on: the type of gallbladder cancer you have the stage of your cancer your overall level of health As with all cancers, the chances of survival depend on how far the condition has advanced when it is diagnosed. For example, if the cancerous cells are confined to the gallbladder lining, your chances of living for more than five years are good (about 80%). However, if gallbladder cancer has spread into the surrounding tissue or lymph nodes, your chances of living for at least five years are much lower (30%). The Cancer Research UK website has more information about treating gallbladder cancer and the stages and outlook for gallbladder cancer.  1. Liver 2. Gallbladder 3. Bile duct 4.

When cancer affects organs and solid tissues, it causes a growth called a tumour to form. Cancer can occur in any part of the body where the cells multiply abnormally.

The gallbladder is a small, pouch-like organ in the upper right part of your tummy. It stores bile, a fluid produced by the liver that helps break down fatty foods. You don't need a gallbladder, so surgery to take it out is often recommended if you develop any problems with it. Why does my gallbladder need to be removed? Surgery to remove the gallbladder is usually carried out if you have painful gallstones. These are small stones that can form in the gallbladder as a result of an imbalance in the substances that make up bile. Gallstones often cause no symptoms and you may not realise you have them, but occasionally they can block the flow of bile and irritate the gallbladder (acute cholecystitis) or pancreas (acute pancreatitis). This can cause symptoms such as: sudden and intense tummy pain feeling and being sick yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) Very occasionally it may be possible to take tablets to dissolve gallstones, but surgery to remove the gallbladder is the most effective treatment in the vast majority of cases. What happens during gallbladder removal surgery There are two main ways of removing a gallbladder: laparoscopic (keyhole) cholecystectomy \u2013 several small cuts (incisions) are made in your tummy (abdomen) and fine surgical instruments are used to access and remove your gallbladder open cholecystectomy \u2013 a single, larger incision is made in your tummy to access and remove your gallbladder Keyhole surgery is used most often because you can leave hospital sooner, recover faster and are left with smaller scars than with an open procedure. Both techniques are performed under general anaesthetic, which means you'll be asleep during the operation and won't feel any pain while it's carried out. Read more about how gallbladder removal surgery is performed. Recovering from gallbladder removal surgery It doesn't usually take long to recover from keyhole surgery to remove your gallbladder. Most people can leave hospital the same day or the next morning. You'll probably be able to return to most of your normal activities within two weeks. It takes longer to recover from open surgery. You may need to stay in hospital for three to five days and it could be six to eight weeks before you're feeling back to normal. Read more about recovering from gallbladder removal surgery. Living without a gallbladder You can lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. Your liver will still make enough bile to digest your food but, instead of being stored in the gallbladder, it drips continuously into your digestive system. You may have been advised to eat a special diet before surgery, but this doesn't need to be continued afterwards. Instead, you should aim to have a generally healthy, balanced diet. Some people experience problems such as bloating or diarrhoea after surgery, although this usually improves within a few weeks. If you notice certain foods or drinks trigger these symptoms, you may wish to avoid them in the future. Read more about your diet after gallbladder surgery. Risks of gallbladder removal surgery Gallbladder removal surgery is considered to be a safe procedure, but like any type of surgery there is a risk of complications. Possible complications include: wound infection bile leaking into the tummy damage to one of the openings (ducts) carrying bile out of the liver blood clots Speak to your surgeon about the benefits and risks of surgery before your operation.

It usually occurs when a gallstone blocks the cystic duct. Gallstones are small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder. The cystic duct is the main opening of the gallbladder. Gallstones are very common, affecting about 1 in 10 adults in the UK. They don't usually cause symptoms, but they can occasionally cause episodes of pain (biliary colic) or acute cholecystitis. Acute cholecystitis is potentially serious. It usually needs to be treated in hospital with rest, intravenous fluids and antibiotics. This topic covers: Symptoms of acute cholecystitis When to seek medical advice What causes acute cholecysitis Diagnosing cholecystitis Treating cholecystitis Possible complications Preventing cholecystitis Symptoms of cholecystitis The main symptom of acute cholecystitis is a sudden sharp pain in the upper right-hand side of your tummy (abdomen). This pain spreads towards your right shoulder. The affected part of the abdomen is usually very tender, and breathing deeply can make the pain worse. Unlike other types of abdominal pain, the pain of acute cholecystitis is usually persistent and doesn't go away within a few hours. Some people may have additional symptoms, such as: a high temperature (fever) nausea and vomiting sweating loss of appetite yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) a bulge in the abdomen When to seek medical advice See your GP as soon as possible if you develop sudden and severe abdominal pain, particularly if it lasts longer than a few hours or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as jaundice and a fever. If you're unable to contact your GP immediately, phone your local out-of-hours service or call NHS 111 for advice. It's important for acute cholecystitis to be diagnosed as soon as possible as there's a risk serious complications could develop if it isn't treated promptly.   What causes acute cholecystitis? The causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into two main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis. Calculous cholecystitis Calculous cholecystitis is the most common, and usually less serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases. Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, called the cystic duct, gets blocked by a gallstone or a substance known as biliary sludge. Biliary sludge is a mixture of bile, a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats, and small cholesterol and salt crystals. The blockage in the cystic duct causes bile to build up in the gallbladder, increasing the pressure inside it and causing it to become inflamed. In around one in every five cases, the inflamed gallbladder also becomes infected by bacteria. Acalculous cholecystitis Acalculous cholecystitis is a less common, but usually more serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It usually develops as a complication of a serious illness, infection or injury that damages the gallbladder. Acalculous cholecystitis can be caused by accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery, serious injuries or burns, blood poisoning (sepsis), severe malnutrition or AIDS. Diagnosing acute cholecystitis If you have severe abdominal pain, your GP will probably carry out a simple test called Murphy's sign. You'll be asked to breathe in deeply with your GP's hand pressed on your tummy, just below your rib cage. Your gallbladder will move downwards as you breathe in. If you have cholecystitis, you'll experience sudden pain as your gallbladder reaches your doctor's hand. If your symptoms suggest you have acute cholecystitis, your GP will refer you to hospital immediately for further tests and treatment. Tests you may have in hospital include: blood tests \u2013 to check for signs of inflammation in your body an ultrasound scan of your abdomen \u2013 to check for gallstones or other signs of a problem with your gallbladder Other scans \u2013 such as an X-ray, computerised tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u2013 may also be carried out to examine your gallbladder in more detail if there's any uncertainty about your diagnosis. Treating acute cholecystitis If you're diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, you'll probably need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. Initial treatment Initial treatment will usually involve: not eating or drinking (fasting) to take the strain off your gallbladder receiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to prevent dehydration taking medication to relieve your pain You'll also be given antibiotics if it's thought you have an infection. These often need to be continued for up to a week, during which time you may need to stay in hospital, or you may be able to go home. After initial treatment, any gallstones that may have caused acute cholecystitis usually fall back into the gallbladder and the inflammation will often settle down. Surgery Removing your gallbladder may be recommended at some point after initial treatment to prevent acute cholecystitis recurring and reduce your risk of developing potentially serious complications. This type of surgery is known as a cholecystectomy. Although uncommon, an alternative procedure called a percutaneous cholecystostomy may be carried out if you're too unwell to have surgery. This is where a needle is inserted through your abdomen to drain away the fluid that's built up in the gallbladder. If you're fit enough to have surgery, your doctors will decide when the best time to remove your gallbladder is. In some cases you may need to have surgery immediately or in the next day or two, or it may be necessary to wait a few weeks until the inflammation has settled down. Surgery can be carried out in three ways: laparoscopic cholecystectomy \u2013 a type of keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed using special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts (incisions) in your abdomen single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy \u2013 where the gallbladder is removed through a single incision, which is usually made near the bellybutton open cholecystectomy \u2013 where the gallbladder is removed through a single larger incision in the abdomen Although some people who've had their gallbladder removed have reported symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating certain foods, it's possible to lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. The organ can be useful, but it's not essential as your liver will still produce bile to digest food. Read more about recovering from gallbladder removal. Possible complications Without appropriate treatment, acute cholecystitis can sometimes lead to potentially life-threatening complications. The main complications of acute cholecystitis are: the death of gallbladder tissue (gangrenous cholecystitis) \u2013 which can cause a serious infection that could spread throughout the body the gallbladder splitting open (perforated gallbladder) \u2013 which can spread the infection within your abdomen (peritonitis) or lead to a build-up of pus (abscess) Emergency surgery to remove the gallbladder is needed to treat these complications in about one in every five cases of acute cholecystitis. Preventing acute cholecystitis It isn't always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis, but you can lower your risk of developing it by reducing your risk of getting gallstones. One of the main things you can do to lower your chances of getting gallstones is to adopt a healthy, balanced diet and reduce the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones. Being overweight, particularly being obese, also increases your risk of developing gallstones. You should therefore control your weight by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly. However, low-calorie rapid weight loss diets should be avoided because there's evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and actually increase your risk of developing gallstones. A more gradual weight loss plan is best.  Read more about preventing gallstones. The gallbladder The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ located beneath the liver. It's main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. The liver produces bile, a liquid that helps digest fats and carries toxins excreted by the liver. Bile is passed from the liver through a series of channels called bile ducts into the gallbladder, where it's stored. Over time bile becomes more concentrated, which makes it more effective at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed. The gallbladder is an organ that's useful, but not essential. It can safely be removed without interfering with your ability to digest food.

In most cases they don't cause any symptoms and don't need to be treated. However, if a gallstone becomes trapped in an opening (duct) inside the gallbladder, it can trigger a sudden, intense abdominal pain that usually lasts between one and five hours. This type of abdominal pain is known as biliary colic. Some people with gallstones can also develop complications, such as inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), which can cause: persistent pain jaundice  a fever When gallstones cause symptoms or complications, it's known as gallstone disease or cholelithiasis. Read more about: symptoms of gallstones complications of gallstones The gallbladder The gallbladder is a small, pouch-like organ found underneath the liver. Its main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. Bile is a liquid produced by the liver to help digest fats. It's passed from the liver into the gallbladder through a series of channels known as bile ducts. The bile is stored in the gallbladder and, over time, it becomes more concentrated, which makes it better at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed. What causes gallstones? Gallstones are thought to develop because of an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder. In most cases the levels of cholesterol in bile become too high and the excess cholesterol forms into stones. Gallstones are very common. It's estimated that more than 1 in every 10 adults in the UK has gallstones, although only a minority of people develop symptoms. You're more at risk of developing gallstones if you're: overweight or obese  female \u2013 particularly if you've had children 40 or over \u2013 the risk increases as you get older Read more about: causes of gallstones  preventing gallstones Treating gallstones Treatment is usually only necessary if gallstones are causing: symptoms \u2013 such as abdominal pain complications \u2013 such as jaundice or acute pancreatitis In these cases keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder may be recommended. This procedure, known as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, is relatively simple to perform and has a low risk of complications. You can lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. Your liver will still produce bile to digest food, but the bile will just drip continuously into the small intestine, rather than build up in the gallbladder. Read more about: treating gallstones diagnosing gallstones Outlook Most cases of gallstone disease are easily treated with surgery. Very severe cases can be life threatening, especially in people who are already in poor health. However, deaths from gallstone disease are rare in the UK.

The cyst can range from the size of a pea to the size of a golf ball. Ganglion cysts look and feel like a smooth lump under the skin. They're made up of a thick, jelly-like fluid called synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate and cushion them during movement. Ganglions can occur alongside any joint in the body, but are most common on the wrist (particularly the back of the wrist), and the hand and fingers. Ganglions are harmless, but can sometimes be painful. If they don't cause any pain or discomfort, they can be left alone and may disappear without treatment, although this can take a number of years. It's not clear why ganglions form. They seem to occur when the synovial fluid that surrounds a joint or tendon leaks out and collects in a sac. Treatment options Treatment is usually only recommended if the cyst causes pain or affects the range of movement in a joint. The two main treatment options for a ganglion cyst are: draining fluid out of the cyst with a needle and syringe \u2013 the medical term for this is aspiration cutting the cyst out using surgery Availability on the NHS Most clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) don't fund treatment for ganglion cysts unless they cause significant pain or disrupt daily activities. If you want to have a cyst removed for cosmetic reasons, you'll probably have to pay for private treatment. Aspiration Aspiration is usually carried out in the outpatient department of your local hospital or GP surgery. Your doctor will remove as much of the contents of the ganglion as possible with a needle and syringe. The area is sometimes also injected with a dose of steroid medication to help prevent the ganglion returning, although there's no clear evidence this reduces the risk of recurrence. After the procedure, a plaster is placed over the small hole in your skin and can be removed about six hours after the procedure. Aspiration is a simple and painless procedure, and you'll be able to leave the hospital or surgery straight afterwards. It's often the first treatment option offered for ganglion cysts as it's less invasive than surgery. However, around half of all ganglion cysts treated using aspiration return at some point. If a cyst does return, surgery may be necessary. Surgery There are two ways surgery can be used to remove a ganglion cyst: open surgery \u2013 where the surgeon makes a medium-sized cut, usually about 5cm (2 inches) long, over the site of the affected joint or tendon arthroscopic surgery \u2013 a type of keyhole surgery where smaller incisions are made and a tiny camera called an arthroscope is used by the surgeon to look inside the joint; using the arthroscope as a guide, they then pass instruments through the incision to remove the cyst Both techniques can be performed under either local anaesthetic, where you are awake but won't feel any pain, or general anaesthetic, where you are asleep during the operation. The choice depends on where the ganglion is, which anaesthetic you'd prefer, and what your surgeon thinks is best. Open or keyhole surgery? Both techniques are equally effective at removing the cyst and reducing the risk of it returning. Keyhole surgery tends to cause less pain after the operation, but waiting times are often longer. After the operation The surgeon will stitch up the wound and a bandage will be placed over the area. This helps keep the area clean, reducing the risk of infection, as well as keeping it safe from any accidental bumps. The wound isn't usually painful, but you'll be given painkillers to take if you feel any discomfort after the operation. If the cyst was removed from your wrist or hand, you may need to wear a sling for the first few days. This helps keep your arm safe from any accidental knocks, and may help reduce swelling and discomfort. Move your fingers regularly to help keep the joints flexible. Surgery to remove a ganglion cyst leaves a scar, which can occasionally be thick and red. For some people, the skin around the scar remains numb after the operation. You'll usually experience some bruising in the area after your operation, but this should fade quickly. There's also a small possibility of temporary stiffness, swelling or pain afterwards. This may be caused by a minor infection that can be treated using antibiotics. Lasting pain or stiffness may need further treatment with physiotherapy. How much time you need to take off work after surgery to remove a ganglion cyst largely depends on where the ganglion is and your job. If your job involves manual labour, you may need to take time off. You can usually start driving again once it feels safe. Complications Having a ganglion cyst removed is a minor procedure, so complications are rare and seldom serious. However, a small number of people experience permanent stiffness and pain after surgery. If you have the operation under general anaesthetic, there's also a very small risk of complications to your heart and lungs. Pre-assessment tests before surgery should make sure your risks are as low as possible. There's always a chance a ganglion cyst will come back after treatment. This is more likely if the ganglion is on certain areas of the wrist.

It can affect any part of the body but typically starts in the toes, feet, fingers and hands. Gangrene can occur as a result of an injury, infection or a long-term condition that affects blood circulation. Symptoms of gangrene include: redness and swelling in the affected area either a loss of sensation or severe pain in the affected area sores or blisters in the affected area that bleed or produce a foul-smelling pus You should see your GP immediately if you're worried you may have gangrene. Read more about the symptoms of gangrene and diagnosing gangrene. Who's affected Anyone can develop gangrene, particularly after a serious injury, but there are certain groups of people who are more at risk. These include people with long-term conditions that can affect the blood vessels, such as: diabetes \u2013 a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high atherosclerosis \u2013 where the arteries become clogged up with a fatty substance called plaque, narrowing them and restricting blood flow  peripheral arterial disease \u2013 where a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries restricts blood supply to leg muscles Raynaud's phenomenon \u2013 where blood vessels in certain parts of the body, usually the fingers or toes, react abnormally to cold temperatures In 2013-14, more than 35,500 cases of gangrene were seen in hospitals in England. Read more about the causes of gangrene. How gangrene is treated The earlier treatment for gangrene begins, the more successful it's likely to be. The main treatments include surgery to remove damaged tissue, known as debridement, and antibiotics to treat any underlying infection. In some cases, surgery may be needed to restore blood flow to the affected area. In more severe cases, it may be necessary to remove an entire body part such as a toe, foot, or lower leg. This is known as amputation. Read more about treating gangrene. Preventing gangrene Many cases of gangrene can be prevented. If you have a condition that increases your risk of getting gangrene, such as diabetes, it's important you have regular check-ups to assess the state of your feet. Report any problems to your GP as soon as possible. Stopping smoking if you smoke and adopting a healthy lifestyle, with a low-fat diet and regular exercise, can also improve your circulation and reduce your risk of developing gangrene.

There are four types of gastrectomy: total gastrectomy \u2013 the whole stomach is removed partial gastrectomy \u2013 the lower part of the stomach is removed sleeve gastrectomy \u2013 the left side of the stomach is removed oesophagogastrectomy \u2013 the top part of the stomach and part of the oesophagus (gullet) is removed The stomach is connected to the gullet (oesophagus) at its top and the first sections of the duodenum (small intestine) at its bottom. During the operation, the surgeon connects the oesophagus either to the small intestine or the remaining section of stomach. This means that you'll still have a working digestive system, although it won't function as well as it did before. Read more about how a gastrectomy is performed. Why is a gastrectomy carried out? A gastrectomy is often used to treat stomach cancer. Less commonly, it's used to treat: life-threatening obesity oesophageal cancer stomach ulcers (peptic ulcers) non-cancerous tumours Read more about why a gastrectomy is used. After a gastrectomy A gastrectomy is a major operation, so recovery can take a long time. You'll usually have to stay in hospital for one or two weeks after the procedure, where you may receive nutrition into a vein until you can eat and drink again. You'll eventually be able to digest most foods and liquids. However, you may need to make changes to your diet, such as eating frequent, smaller meals rather than three large meals a day. You may also need vitamin supplements to ensure you're getting the correct nutrition. In many cases, a gastrectomy is an effective operation. Studies show that survival rates for cancer after a gastrectomy are generally good. It's also been proven that people who have the operation to treat obesity lose a significant amount of weight afterwards. Read more about recovering from a gastrectomy. Results Gastrectomy is usually an effective treatment for cancer and obesity. Cancer Healthcare professionals use the phrase \"five-year disease-free survival\" to refer to people who are alive and well, and whose cancer hasn't returned five years after having surgery. The five-year disease-free survival rate for people who have a gastrectomy for early-stage stomach cancer is estimated to be up to 90%. The five-year disease-free survival rate for people who have a gastrectomy for advanced stomach cancer is estimated to be around 25%. However, many people who have a gastrectomy for stomach cancer live for much longer than five years without the cancer returning. The survival rate of oesophagogastrectomy to treat cancer isn't as good. Studies have shown five-year disease-free survival rates of around 25% for this type of operation. This may be because this operation is usually done if the cancer is discovered at a late stage and has already started to spread. Obesity Sleeve gastrectomy has a good success rate for treating obesity. Studies have found excess weight loss of up to 75% after surgery. Excess weight loss is a measurement based on your weight before surgery and your ideal weight. Further research is needed to determine how effective sleeve gastrectomy is for the long-term treatment of obesity. Studies often show that average excess weight declines over time, which suggests that some people regain some of the weight they initially lost. To get the best results from a sleeve gastrectomy, it's important to follow the instructions given by your healthcare team about diet and exercise. Complications As with any type of surgery, a gastrectomy carries a risk of complications, such as infection, bleeding and leaking from the area that's been stitched together. A gastrectomy may also lead to problems caused by a reduction in your ability to absorb vitamins, such as anaemia and osteoporosis.  Read more about the possible complications of a gastrectomy.

It's usually caused by a bacterial or viral tummy bug. It affects people of all ages, but is particularly common in young children. Most cases in children are caused by a virus called rotavirus. Cases in adults are usually caused by norovirus (the \"winter vomiting bug\") or bacterial food poisoning. Gastroenteritis can be very unpleasant, but it usually clears up by itself within a week. You can normally look after yourself or your child at home until you're feeling better. Try to avoid going to your GP, as gastroenteritis can spread to others very easily. Call NHS 111 or your GP if you're concerned or need any advice. This page covers: Symptoms of gastroenteritis What to do if you have gastroenteritis When to get medical advice Looking after a child with gastroenteritis Getting medical advice for your child How gastroenteritis is spread Preventing gastroenteritis Symptoms of gastroenteritis The main symptoms of gastroenteritis are: sudden, watery diarrhoea feeling sick vomiting, which can be projectile a mild fever Some people also have other symptoms, such as a loss of appetite, an upset stomach, aching limbs and headaches. The symptoms usually appear up to a day after becoming infected. They typically last less than a week, but can sometimes last longer. What to do if you have gastroenteritis If you experience sudden diarrhoea and vomiting, the best thing to do is stay at home until you're feeling better. There's not always a specific treatment, so you have to let the illness run its course. You don't usually need to get medical advice, unless your symptoms don't improve or there's a risk of a more serious problem (see When to get medical advice). To help ease your symptoms: Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration \u2013 You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Water is best, but you could also try fruit juice and soup. Take paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains. Get plenty of rest. If you feel like eating, try small amounts of plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread. Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if you have signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth or dark urine \u2013 read about treating dehydration. Take anti-vomiting medication (such as metoclopramide) and\/or antidiarrhoeal medication (such as loperamide) if you need to \u2013 some types are available from pharmacies, but check the leaflet that comes with the medicine. You can also ask your pharmacist or GP for advice about whether they're suitable.  Gastroenteritis can spread very easily, so you should wash your hands regularly while you're ill and stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after your symptoms have cleared, to reduce the risk of passing it on (see Preventing gastroenteritis). When to get medical advice You don't normally need to see your GP if you think you have gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own. Visiting your GP surgery can put others at risk, so it's best to call NHS 111 or your GP if you're concerned or feel you need advice. Get medical advice if: you have symptoms of severe dehydration, such as persistent dizziness, only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or if you're losing consciousness you have bloody diarrhoea you're vomiting constantly and are unable to keep down any fluids you have a fever over 38C (100.4F) your symptoms haven't started to improve after a few days in the last few weeks you've returned from a part of the world with poor sanitation you have a serious underlying condition, such as kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease or a weak immune system, and have diarrhoea and vomiting Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your poo to a laboratory to check what's causing your symptoms. Antibiotics may be prescribed if this shows you have a bacterial infection. Looking after a child with gastroenteritis You can look after your child at home if they have diarrhoea and vomiting. There's not usually any specific treatment and your child should start feeling better in a few days. You don't normally need to get medical advice unless their symptoms don't improve or there's a risk of a more serious problem (see Getting medical advice for your child). To help ease your child's symptoms: Encourage them to drink plenty of fluids. They need to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Water is generally best. Avoid giving them fizzy drinks or fruit juice, as they can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds. Make sure they get plenty of rest. Let your child eat if they're eating solids and feel hungry. Try small amounts of plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread. Give them paracetamol if they have an uncomfortable fever or aches and pains. Young children may find liquid paracetamol easier to swallow than tablets. Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if they're dehydrated. Your GP or pharmacist can advise on how much to give your child. Don't give them antidiarrhoeal and anti-vomiting medication, unless advised to by your GP or pharmacist. Make sure you and your child wash your hands regularly while your child is ill and keep them away from school or nursery until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared (see Preventing gastroenteritis). Getting medical advice for your child You don't usually need to see your GP if you think your child has gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own, and taking them to a GP surgery can put others at risk. Call NHS 111 or your GP if you're concerned about your child, or they: have symptoms of dehydration, such as passing less urine than normal, being unusually irritable or unresponsive, pale or mottled skin, or cold hands and feet have blood in their poo or green vomit are vomiting constantly and are unable to keep down any fluids or feeds have had diarrhoea for more than a week have been vomiting for three days or more have signs of a more serious illness, such as a high fever (over 38C or 100.4F), shortness of breath, rapid breathing, a stiff neck, a rash that doesn't fade when you roll a glass over it or a bulging fontanelle (the soft spot on a baby's head) have a serious underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease or a weak immune system, and have diarrhoea and vomiting Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your child's poo to a laboratory to confirm what's causing their symptoms. Antibiotics may be prescribed if this shows they have a bacterial infection. How gastroenteritis is spread The bugs that cause gastroenteritis can spread very easily from person to person. You can catch the infection if small particles of vomit or poo from an infected person get into your mouth, such as through: close contact with someone with gastroenteritis \u2013 they may breathe out small particles of vomit touching contaminated surfaces or objects  eating contaminated food \u2013 this can happen if an infected person doesn't wash their hands before handling food, or you eat food that has been in contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, or hasn't been stored and cooked at the correct temperatures (read more about the causes of food poisoning) A person with gastroenteritis is most infectious from when their symptoms start until 48 hours after all their symptoms have passed, although they may also be infectious for a short time before and after this. Preventing gastroenteritis It's not always possible to avoid getting gastroenteritis, but following the advice below can help stop it spreading: Stay off work, school or nursery until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have passed. You or your child should also avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time. Ensure you and your child wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, particularly after using the toilet and before preparing food. Don't rely on alcohol hand gels, as they're not always effective. Disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated. It's best to use a bleach-based household cleaner. Wash contaminated items of clothing or bedding separately on a hot wash. Don't share towels, flannels, cutlery or utensils while you or your child is ill. Flush away any poo or vomit in the toilet or potty and clean the surrounding area. Practice good food hygiene. Make sure food is properly refrigerated, always cook your food thoroughly, and never eat food that is past its use-by date \u2013 read more about preventing food poisoning.  Take extra care when travelling to parts of the world with poor sanitation, as you could pick up a stomach bug. For example, you may need to boil tap water before drinking it. Young children can have the rotavirus vaccination when they\u2019re two to three months old, which can reduce their risk of developing gastroenteritis.

It's a common condition with a wide range of causes. For most people, gastritis isn't serious and improves quickly if treated \u2013 but if not, it can last for years. Symptoms of gastritis Many people with gastritis caused by a bacterial infection don't have any symptoms. In other cases, gastritis can cause: indigestion gnawing or burning stomach pain nausea and vomiting feeling full after eating If the stomach lining has been worn away (erosive gastritis) and exposed to stomach acid, symptoms may include pain, bleeding or a stomach ulcer. The symptoms of gastritis may come on suddenly and severely (acute gastritis) or last a long time (chronic gastritis). When to see your GP If you have indigestion and stomach pain, you can try treating this yourself with changes to your diet and lifestyle, or with a number of different over-the-counter medications, such as antacids. See your GP if: you have indigestion symptoms lasting a week or longer, or it's causing you severe pain or discomfort you think it's brought on by medication you've been prescribed you're vomiting blood or have blood in your stools (your stools may appear black) Stomach ache and abdominal pain aren't always a sign of gastritis \u2013 the pain could be caused by a wide range of other things, from trapped wind to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Diagnosing gastritis Your GP may recommend one or more of the following tests: a stool test \u2013 to check for infection or bleeding from the stomach a breath test for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection \u2013 this involves drinking a glass of clear, tasteless liquid that contains radioactive carbon and blowing into a bag an endoscopy \u2013 a flexible tube (endoscope) is passed down your throat and into your oesophagus and stomach to look for signs of inflammation a barium swallow \u2013 you're given some barium solution, which shows up clearly on X-rays as it passes through your digestive system Read more about how gastritis is treated. Possible causes of gastritis Gastritis is usually caused by one of the following: a H. pylori bacterial infection \u2013 see below excessive use of cocaine or alcohol regularly taking aspirin, ibuprofen or other painkillers classed as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  a stressful event \u2013 such as a bad injury or critical illness, or major surgery less commonly, an autoimmune reaction \u2013 when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own cells and tissues (in this case, the stomach lining) H. pylori gastritis Many people become infected with H. pylori bacteria and don't realise it. These stomach infections are common and don't usually cause symptoms. However, an H. pylori infection can sometimes cause recurring bouts of indigestion, as the bacteria can cause inflammation of the stomach lining. This sort of gastritis is more common in older age groups and is usually the cause of chronic (persistent) non-erosive cases. An H. pylori stomach infection is usually lifelong, unless it's treated with eradication therapy (see below). Treating gastritis Treatment aims to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach to relieve symptoms, allowing the stomach lining to heal and to tackle any underlying cause. You may be able to treat gastritis yourself, depending on the cause. Easing symptoms antacids \u2013 these over-the-counter medicines neutralise the acid in your stomach, which can provide rapid pain relief histamine 2 (H2) blockers such as ranitidine \u2013 these medicines decrease acid production, and are available both over the counter and on prescription proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole \u2013 these medicines decrease acid production even more effectively than H2 blockers, and are available both over the counter and on prescription Treating H. pylori infection If you've been diagnosed with an H. pylori infection, you'll need to take a course of antibiotics alongside a medication called a proton pump inhibitor. Read more about treating an H. pylori infection. What else can I do to help myself? If you think the cause of your gastritis is repeated use of NSAID painkillers, try switching to a different painkiller that isn't in the NSAID class, such as paracetamol. You may want to talk to your GP about this. Also consider: eating smaller, more frequent meals avoiding irritating (spicy, acidic or fried) foods  avoiding or cutting down on alcohol managing stress (read our relaxation tips)  Possible complications of gastritis Chronic gastritis increases your risk of developing: a stomach ulcer polyps (small growths) in your stomach tumours in your stomach, which may or may not be cancerous Gastritis vs gastroenteritis: the difference Gastroenteritis: inflammation (irritation) of the stomach and bowel, caused by an infection Gastritis: inflammation of the stomach lining specifically, and not always caused by infection  Page last reviewed: 23\/06\/2016 Next review due: 23\/06\/2019 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's usually caused by a bacterial or viral tummy bug. It affects people of all ages, but is particularly common in young children. Most cases in children are caused by a virus called rotavirus. Cases in adults are usually caused by norovirus (the \"winter vomiting bug\") or bacterial food poisoning. Gastroenteritis can be very unpleasant, but it usually clears up by itself within a week. You can normally look after yourself or your child at home until you're feeling better. Try to avoid going to your GP, as gastroenteritis can spread to others very easily.

It affects most people from time to time and is usually nothing to worry about. However, it can be distressing and unpleasant until it passes, which normally takes a few days to a week. What causes diarrhoea? There are many different causes of diarrhoea, but a bowel infection (gastroenteritis) is a common cause in both adults and children. Gastroenteritis can be caused by: a virus \u2013 such as norovirus or rotavirus bacteria \u2013 such as campylobacter and Escherichia coli (E. coli), which are often picked up from contaminated food  a parasite \u2013 such as the parasite that causes giardiasis, which is spread in contaminated water These infections can sometimes be caught during travel abroad, particularly to areas with poor standards of public hygiene. This is known as travellers' diarrhoea. Diarrhoea can also be the result of anxiety, a food allergy, medication, or a long-term condition, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Read more about the causes of diarrhoea. What to do if you have diarrhoea Most cases of diarrhoea clear up after a few days without treatment, and you may not need to see your GP. However, diarrhoea can lead to dehydration, so you should drink plenty of fluids \u2013 small, frequent sips of water \u2013 until it passes. It's very important that babies and small children do not become dehydrated. Your pharmacist may suggest you use an oral rehydration solution (ORS) if you or your child are particularly at risk of dehydration. You should eat solid food as soon as you feel able to. If you're breastfeeding or bottle feeding your baby and they have diarrhoea, you should try to feed them as normal. Stay at home until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea to prevent spreading any infection to others. Medications to reduce diarrhoea, such as loperamide, are available. However, these are not usually necessary, and most types should not be given to children. Read more about treating diarrhoea. When to see your GP Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if you're concerned about yourself or your child. It's important to see your GP if the diarrhoea is particularly frequent or severe, or associated with other symptoms, such as: blood in your or your child's poo persistent vomiting a severe or continuous stomach ache weight loss signs of dehydration \u2013 including drowsiness, passing urine infrequently, and feeling lightheaded or dizzy your poo is dark or black \u2013 this may be a sign of bleeding inside your stomach You should also contact your GP if your or your child's diarrhoea is particularly persistent, as this may be a sign of a more serious problem. In most cases, diarrhoea should pass within about a week. Read more about when to contact your GP and diagnosing diarrhoea. Preventing diarrhoea Diarrhoea is often caused by an infection. You can reduce your risk by making sure you maintain high standards of hygiene. For example, you should: wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after going to the toilet and before eating or preparing food clean the toilet, including the handle and the seat, with disinfectant after each bout of diarrhoea avoid sharing towels, flannels, cutlery, or utensils with other household members It's also important to practise good food and water hygiene while travelling abroad, such as avoiding potentially unsafe tap water and undercooked food.

It's also called the \"winter vomiting bug\" because it's more common in winter, although you can catch it at any time of the year. Norovirus can be very unpleasant but it usually clears up by itself in a few days. You can normally look after yourself or your child at home. Try to avoid going to your GP, as norovirus can spread to others very easily. Call your GP or NHS 111 if you're concerned or need any advice. This page covers: Symptoms of norovirus What to do if you have norovirus When to get medical advice How is norovirus spread? Preventing norovirus Symptoms of norovirus The symptoms of norovirus are very distinctive. You're likely to have norovirus if you experience: suddenly feeling sick projectile vomiting watery diarrhoea Some people also have a slight fever, headaches, painful stomach cramps and aching limbs. The symptoms appear one to two days after you become infected and typically last for up to two or three days. What to do if you have norovirus If you experience sudden diarrhoea and vomiting, the best thing to do is to stay at home until you're feeling better. There's no cure for norovirus, so you have to let it run its course. You don't usually need to get medical advice unless there's a risk of a more serious problem (see When to get medical advice). To help ease your own or your child\u2019s symptoms: Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea \u2013 as well as water, adults could also try fruit juice and soup. Avoid giving fizzy drinks or fruit juice to children as it can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds. Take paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains. Get plenty of rest. If you feel like eating, eat plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread. Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if you have signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth or dark urine \u2013 read more about treating dehydration. Adults can take antidiarrhoeal and\/or anti-emetic (anti-vomiting) medication \u2013 these are not suitable for everyone though, so you should check the medicine leaflet or ask or your pharmacist or GP for advice before trying them. Babies and young children, especially if they're less than a year old, have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated. Read advice about looking after babies and children under five who have diarrhoea and vomiting. Norovirus can spread very easily, so you should wash your hands regularly while you're ill and stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have cleared, to reduce the risk of passing it on (see Preventing norovirus below). When to get medical advice You don't normally need to see your GP if you think you or your child has norovirus, as there's no specific treatment for it.  Antibiotics won't help because it's caused by a virus. Visiting your GP surgery with norovirus can put others at risk, so it's best to call your GP or NHS 111 if you're concerned or feel you need advice. Get medical advice if: your baby or child has passed six or more watery stools in the past 24 hours, or has vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours your baby or child is less responsive, feverish, or has pale or mottled skin you or your child has symptoms of severe dehydration, such as persistent dizziness, only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or reduced consciousness \u2013 babies and elderly people have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated you have bloody diarrhoea your symptoms haven't started to improve after a few days you or your child have a serious underlying condition, such as kidney disease, and have diarrhoea and vomiting Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your stool to a laboratory to confirm whether you have norovirus or another infection. How is norovirus spread? Norovirus spreads very easily in public places such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools. You can catch it if small particles of vomit or poo from an infected person get into your mouth, such as through: close contact with someone with norovirus \u2013 they may breathe out small particles containing the virus that you could inhale touching contaminated surfaces or objects \u2013 the virus can survive outside the body for several days eating contaminated food \u2013 this can happen if an infected person doesn't wash their hands before handling food A person with norovirus is most infectious from when their symptoms start until 48 hours after all their symptoms have passed, although they may also be infectious for a short time before and after this. You can get norovirus more than once because the virus is always changing, so your body is unable to build up long-term resistance to it. Preventing norovirus It's not always possible to avoid getting norovirus, but following the advice below can help stop the virus spreading. Stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have passed. You should also avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, particularly after using the toilet and before preparing food. Don't rely on alcohol hand gels, as they do not kill the virus. Disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated. It's best to use a bleach-based household cleaner. Wash any items of clothing or bedding that could have become contaminated separately on a hot wash to ensure the virus is killed. Don't share towels and flannels. Flush away any infected poo or vomit in the toilet and clean the surrounding area. Avoid eating raw, unwashed produce and only eat oysters from a reliable source, as oysters can carry norovirus.

Vomiting is the body\u2019s way of ridding itself of harmful substances from the stomach, or it may be a reaction to something that has irritated the gut. One of the most common causes of vomiting in adults is gastroenteritis. This is an infection of the gut usually caused by bacteria or a virus, which will normally improve within a few days. However, vomiting can occasionally be a sign of something more serious, such as appendicitis, so if you are feeling very unwell or are worried about your vomiting, trust your instincts and call your GP. There is a separate topic on vomiting in children and babies. When to contact your GP Contact your GP if: you've been vomiting repeatedly for more than a day or two you're unable to keep down any fluids because you are vomiting repeatedly your vomit is green (this could mean you are bringing up a fluid called bile, which suggests you may have a blockage in your bowel \u2013 see below) you have signs of severe dehydration, such as confusion, a rapid heartbeat, sunken eyes and passing little or no urine you've lost a lot of weight since you became ill you experience episodes of vomiting frequently Your GP may want to investigate the cause of your vomiting or prescribe treatment. You should also see your GP if you have diabetes and have been vomiting persistently, particularly if you need to take insulin. This is because prolonged vomiting can affect your blood sugar level. When to seek emergency medical help Occasionally, vomiting can be a sign of a more serious problem. You should call 999 for an ambulance, or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if you also have: sudden, severe abdominal (tummy) pain severe chest pain blood in your vomit or what looks like coffee granules a stiff neck and high temperature (fever) a sudden, severe headache that's unlike any headache you've had before You should also seek emergency medical help if you think you have swallowed something poisonous. Common causes of vomiting in adults Gastroenteritis If you have diarrhoea as well as vomiting, it's likely you have gastroenteritis. This is one of the most common causes of vomiting in adults. It's often the result of a virus picked up from someone who's ill, such as the norovirus, or food poisoning caused by bacteria found in contaminated food. Your immune system will usually fight off the infection after a few days and the self-care measures described above can help in the meantime. Read more about treating gastroenteritis. Pregnancy Pregnant women typically experience repeated episodes of nausea and vomiting, particularly during the early stages of pregnancy. This is often called \"morning sickness\", although it can occur throughout the day. In most cases, morning sickness will develop at some point during the first three months of pregnancy and will pass by about weeks 16-20. Read more about morning sickness, including things you can do to help reduce your symptoms. Migraines If you have recurrent episodes of vomiting along with intense, throbbing headaches that last for a few hours to days at a time, you may be experiencing migraines. Conventional painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, can sometimes help control the pain and your GP can prescribe anti-sickness medicine to help prevent vomiting. Read more about treating migraines. Labyrinthitis If your vomiting is accompanied by dizziness and a feeling of spinning (vertigo), it may be caused by an inner ear infection called labyrinthitis. Labyrinthitis will usually improve over a few days, and your GP can prescribe medication to reduce your symptoms if necessary. Motion sickness Nausea and vomiting associated with travelling could be a sign of motion sickness. These symptoms can sometimes be improved using techniques such as fixing your eyes on the horizon or distracting yourself by listening to music, although medication to prevent and treat motion sickness is also available.  Appendicitis As well as vomiting, appendicitis can cause severe pain in your abdomen (tummy). You should call 999 for an ambulance if you experience pain that suddenly becomes worse and spreads across your abdomen. These are signs that your appendix may have burst. If you have appendicitis, you will often need surgery to remove your appendix. Read more about treating appendicitis. Other causes of vomiting in adults Vomiting in adults can also be caused by a number of other things, including: certain medicines, such as antibiotics and opioid painkillers drinking too much alcohol kidney infections and kidney stones a blockage in your bowel, which may be caused by a hernia or gallstones chemotherapy and radiotherapy acute cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) Clink on the links above for more information about these conditions and treatments. Looking after yourself at home In most cases, you won't need any specific treatment and can take care of yourself at home until you feel better. The most important thing you can do is to keep taking small sips of water frequently so you don't become dehydrated. A sweet drink such as fruit juice can be useful for replacing lost sugar, although you should avoid sweet drinks if they make you feel sick. Salty snacks, such as crisps, can help replace lost salt. You may also find ginger helps to relieve your nausea and vomiting. This is available as supplements, or can be found in ginger biscuits and ginger tea. Check with your pharmacist or GP before using ginger supplements. Page last reviewed: 17\/12\/2014 Next review due: 17\/12\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The most common cause of vomiting in children and babies is gastroenteritis. This is an infection of the gut usually caused by a virus or bacteria, which also causes diarrhoea. The symptoms can be unpleasant but your child will usually start to feel better after a few days. However, persistent vomiting can sometimes cause your child to become severely dehydrated and occasionally it can be a sign of something more serious, such as meningitis. This page outlines what to do if your child keeps vomiting and describes some of the common causes of vomiting in children and babies. If your child has a high temperature, you can also read a separate page about fever in children. What to do If your child vomits, you should keep a close eye on them. Trust your instincts and contact your GP immediately if you're worried. If the cause is just a tummy bug, your child should still be feeling well enough to eat, play and be their usual self. In this case, keep feeding them as normal and offer them regular drinks (see below). But if they don't seem themself \u2013 for example, if they're floppy, irritable or less responsive \u2013 they may be seriously ill, so you should get medical help immediately. When to get medical advice You should contact your GP if: your child is repeatedly vomiting and is unable to hold down fluids you think they're dehydrated \u2013 symptoms of dehydration can include a dry mouth, crying without producing tears, urinating less or not wetting many nappies, and drowsiness their vomit is green or contains blood they have been vomiting for more than a day or two Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if your child is vomiting and develops sudden and severe tummy pain, or they're floppy, irritable or less responsive Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest A&E department immediately if they're vomiting and have a headache, stiff neck and a rash. Looking after your child at home In most cases, you can treat your child safely at home. The most important thing you can do is make sure they keep drinking fluids to prevent dehydration. If your baby is vomiting, carry on breastfeeding or giving them milk feeds. If they seem dehydrated, they will need extra fluids. Ask your GP or pharmacist whether you should give your baby oral rehydration solution. Oral rehydration solution is a special powder that you make into a drink. It contains sugar and salts to help replace the water and salts lost through vomiting and diarrhoea. Children who are vomiting should keep taking small sips of clear fluid, such as water or clear broth. Fruit juice and fizzy drinks should be avoided until they're feeling better. If they're not dehydrated and haven't lost their appetite, it's fine for your child to eat solid foods as normal. Again, speak to your GP or pharmacist if you're concerned about dehydration. They may recommend an oral rehydration solution for your child. Contact your GP or practice nurse if your child is unable to hold down oral rehydration solution. If your child has diarrhoea and is vomiting, they shouldn't go to school or any other childcare facility until 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea or vomiting. Read more about treating gastroenteritis in children. Causes of vomiting in children There are a number of possible causes of vomiting in children, which are described below. Gastroenteritis Gastroenteritis is an infection of the gut. It's a common cause of vomiting in children and usually lasts a few days. Food allergy Food allergies can cause vomiting in children, as well as other symptoms, such as a raised, red, itchy skin rash (urticaria) and swelling of the face, around the eyes, lips, tongue or the roof of the mouth. Watch out for foods that may bring on vomiting and see your GP for a diagnosis if you think your child may have a food allergy. Other infections Vomiting can sometimes be a sign of an infection other than gastroenteritis, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), middle ear infections, pneumonia or meningitis. Contact your child's GP if they're vomiting and experiencing additional symptoms of an infection, such as a high temperature (fever) and irritability. Appendicitis Appendicitis is a painful swelling of the appendix, a finger-like pouch connected to the large intestine. It causes severe tummy pain that gets worse over time. If your child has tummy pain that's gradually getting worse, contact your GP, local out-of-hours service or NHS 111 immediately. You should call 999 for an ambulance if they have pain that gets worse quickly and spreads across their tummy. In most cases of appendicitis, the appendix will need to be surgically removed as soon as possible. Poison Accidentally swallowing something poisonous can cause your child to vomit. If you think this is the case, contact your GP immediately or take your child to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Causes of vomiting in babies These include: gastroenteritis  a food allergy or milk intolerance gastro-oesophageal reflux \u2013 where stomach contents escape back up the gullet  too big a hole in the bottle teat, which causes your baby to swallow too much milk \u2013 read more bottle feeding advice accidentally swallowing something poisonous congenital pyloric stenosis \u2013 a condition present at birth where the passage from the stomach to the bowel has narrowed, so food is unable to pass through easily; this causes projectile vomiting a strangulated hernia \u2013 your baby will vomit frequently and cry as if they are in a lot of pain; this should be treated as a medical emergency intussusception (where the bowel telescopes in on itself) \u2013 as well as vomiting, your baby may look pale, floppy and have symptoms of dehydration Page last reviewed: 17\/04\/2015 Next review due: 17\/04\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It usually occurs as a result of the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus becoming weakened. Read more about the causes of GORD. GORD causes symptoms such as heartburn and an unpleasant taste in the back of the mouth. It may just be an occasional nuisance for some people, but for others it can be a severe, lifelong problem. GORD can often be controlled with self-help measures and medication. Occasionally, surgery to correct the problem may be needed. This topic focuses on GORD in adults. There are separate topics on reflux in babies and heartburn in pregnancy. This page covers: Symptoms of GORD What to do if you have GORD When to see your GP Treatments for GORD Complications of GORD Symptoms of GORD Symptoms of GORD can include: heartburn (an uncomfortable burning sensation in the chest that often occurs after eating) acid reflux (where stomach acid comes back up into your mouth and causes an unpleasant, sour taste) oesophagitis (a sore, inflamed oesophagus) bad breath bloating and belching feeling or being sick pain when swallowing and\/or difficulty swallowing Read more about the symptoms of GORD. What to do if you have GORD You can often control the symptoms of GORD by making some lifestyle changes and taking over-the-counter medication. See treatments for GORD for more information. You don't necessarily need to see your GP if you only have symptoms occasionally. Ask your pharmacist for advice on treatments.  When to see your GP Visit your GP if you're worried about your symptoms, or if: you have symptoms several times a week over-the-counter medications aren't helping your symptoms are severe you have difficulty swallowing you have possible signs of a more serious problem, such as persistent vomiting, vomiting blood or unexplained weight loss Your GP will usually be able to diagnose GORD based on your symptoms, although they may refer you for some tests. Read more about diagnosing GORD. Treatments for GORD The main treatments for GORD are: self-help measures \u2013 this includes eating smaller but more frequent meals, avoiding any foods or drinks that trigger your symptoms, raising the head of your bed, and keeping to a healthy weight over-the-counter medicines \u2013 ask your pharmacist to recommend an antacid or an alginate stronger prescription medicines \u2013 including proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) You may only need to take medication when you experience symptoms, although long-term treatment may be needed if the problem continues. Surgery to stop stomach acid leaking into your oesophagus may be recommended if medication isn't helping, or you don't want to take medication on a long-term basis. Read more about the treatments for GORD. Complications of GORD If you have GORD for a long time, stomach acid can damage your oesophagus and cause further problems. These include: ulcers (sores) on the oesophagus \u2013 these may bleed and make swallowing painful the oesophagus becoming scarred and narrowed \u2013 this can make swallowing difficult and may require an operation to correct it changes in the cells lining the oesophagus (Barrett's oesophagus) \u2013 very occasionally, oesophageal cancer can develop from these cells, so you may need to be closely monitored Read more about the complications of GORD.

They're available over the counter from pharmacies and are often used to treat the symptoms of heartburn and indigestion. How antacids work Antacids counteract (neutralise) the acid in your stomach that's used to aid digestion. This helps reduce the symptoms of heartburn and relieves pain. Some antacids also coat the surface of the oesophagus (gullet) with a protective barrier against stomach acid, or produce a gel on the stomach\u2019s surface which helps stop acid leaking into the oesophagus and causing acid reflux. Different types of antacids Antacids are available in liquid form or as chewable tablets. They're sold under various brand names but contain common ingredients, including: aluminium hydroxide magnesium carbonate magnesium trisilicate Extra ingredients are sometimes added to help treat other problems, such as simeticone to relieve flatulence (wind), and alginates to prevent acid flowing into your oesophagus. Who can't take antacids? Antacids aren't suitable for everyone. For example, many antacids aren't recommended for children under the age of 12 and people with certain health conditions, such as kidney disease. Antacids can also interfere with other medications, so you may not be able to take them while you're being treated for another condition. Antacids are generally considered safe to take during pregnancy, but you should discuss it with your GP or pharmacist beforehand. Read more about who can't take antacid medicines. Possible side effects of antacids Like all medicines, antacids can have side effects. Common side effects include: diarrhoea constipation flatulence stomach cramps feeling sick or vomiting If you have diarrhoea or constipation after taking antacids it may be possible to switch to an alternative medicine. Speak to your GP or pharmacist for advice. Any side effects you experience while taking antacids should pass once you stop taking the medication. Visit your GP if they continue. Missed or extra doses When taking antacid medicines, follow the instructions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine or the advice of your GP or pharmacist. If you miss a dose, it won't usually be necessary to alter your next dose. It's likely that you can carry on taking your normal dose. However, for specific advice about what to do, refer to the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. Taking extra doses could cause several unpleasant side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation. Contact your GP or pharmacist immediately if you think that you've taken more antacids than you should have. Alternatively, you can call NHS 111 for advice.

It means food passes through the stomach more slowly than usual, leading to symptoms such as: feeling full very quickly when eating nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting loss of appetite weight loss bloating abdominal (tummy) pain or discomfort heartburn These symptoms can be mild or severe, and tend to come and go. If you think you may have gastroparesis you should see your GP, as it can lead to some potentially serious complications, including: dehydration from repeated vomiting gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) \u2013 where stomach acid leaks out of your stomach and into your gullet malnutrition \u2013 when your body is not getting enough nutrients unpredictable blood sugar levels \u2013 this is a particular risk in people with diabetes (see below) What causes gastroparesis? Gastroparesis is thought to be the result of a problem with the nerves and muscles controlling the emptying of the stomach. If these nerves are damaged, the muscles of your stomach may not work properly and the movement of food can slow down. In many cases, the cause is unknown \u2013 this is known as idiopathic gastroparesis. Known causes include usually poorly controlled type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes. The nerves to the stomach can be damaged by high levels of blood glucose. Therefore it's important to keep your blood glucose levels under control if you have diabetes. Read about healthy living with diabetes. Gastroparesis can also be a complication of some types of surgery, such as weight loss (bariatric) surgery or a gastrectomy (removal of part of the stomach). Other possible causes include: medications such as opioid painkillers (for example, morphine) and some antidepressants Parkinson's disease \u2013 a condition in which part of the brain becomes progressively damaged over many years scleroderma \u2013 an uncommon disease that results in hard, thickened areas of skin and sometimes problems with internal organs and blood vessels amyloidosis \u2013 a group of rare but serious diseases caused by deposits of abnormal protein in tissues and organs throughout the body Diagnosing gastroparesis To diagnose gastroparesis, your GP will ask about your symptoms and medical history, and may arrange some blood tests. You may be referred to hospital for some of the following tests: a barium X-ray \u2013 you swallow a liquid containing the chemical barium, which shows up on X-ray and highlights its passage through your digestive system a gastric emptying scan using scintigraphy \u2013 you eat food (often eggs) containing a very small amount of a radioactive substance that is detected on the scan; gastroparesis is diagnosed if more than 10% of the food is still in your stomach four hours after eating a wireless capsule test \u2013 you swallow a small, electronic device that sends information about how fast it moves through your digestive tract to a recording device endoscopy \u2013 a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) is passed down your throat and into your stomach to examine the stomach lining and rule out other possible causes Treating gastroparesis Gastroparesis cannot usually be cured, but dietary changes and medical treatments can help you control the condition. Dietary changes You may find these tips helpful: instead of three meals a day, try more frequent, smaller meals \u2013 this will mean there is less food in your stomach and it will be easier to pass through your system try soft and liquid foods, which are easier to digest chew food well before swallowing drink non-fizzy liquids with each meal It may also help to avoid certain foods that are hard to digest \u2013 such as apples with their skin on, or high-fibre foods like oranges and broccoli \u2013 as well as foods high in fat (which can also slow down digestion). Medication The following medications may help improve your symptoms: domperidone \u2013 which is taken before eating to contract your stomach muscles and help move food along erythromycin \u2013 an antibiotic that also helps contract the stomach and may help move food along anti-emetics \u2013 medications that control nausea However, the evidence that these medications relieve the symptoms of gastroparesis is relatively limited and they can cause a number of side effects, so make sure you discuss the potential risks and benefits with your doctor. Domperidone should only be taken at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration due to the small risk of potentially serious heart-related side effects. A similar medication to domperidone called metoclopramide used to be frequently used to treat people with gastroparesis. However, it\u2019s no longer widely recommended for the condition because of concerns about serious side effects such as muscle spasms and twitches that can occur when the medication is used for a long time. Electrical stimulation If dietary changes and medication don't improve your symptoms, a relatively new treatment called gastroelectrical stimulation may be tried. However, this is currently not routinely funded by many local NHS authorities. Gastroelectrical stimulation involves surgically implanting a battery-operated device under the skin of your tummy. Two leads attached to this device are fixed to the muscles of your lower stomach. They deliver electrical impulses to help stimulate the muscles involved in controlling the passage of food through your stomach. The device is turned on using a handheld external control. The effectiveness of this treatment can vary considerably. Not everyone will respond to it and for many of those who do, the effect will largely wear off within 12 months. Therefore, this treatment is not suitable for everyone with gastroparesis. There is also a small chance of this procedure leading to complications such as infection, the device dislodging and moving, or a hole forming in your stomach wall, which would mean removing the device. Speak to your surgeon about the possible risks. For more information, read the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on gastroelectrical stimulation for gastroparesis. Botulinum toxin More severe cases of gastroparesis may occasionally be treated by injecting botulinum toxin into the valve between your stomach and small intestine, to relax it and keep it open for a longer period of time so food can pass through. The injection is given through an endoscope, which is passed down your throat and into your stomach. This is a fairly new treatment and some studies have found that it may not be very effective, so it is not recommended by all doctors. A feeding tube If you have extremely severe gastroparesis that is not improved with dietary changes and medication, you may benefit from a feeding tube. Many different types of feeding tube are available \u2013 some only temporary, and others permanent. A temporary feeding tube called a nasojejunal tube may be offered to you first, which is inserted through your nose to pass nutrients directly into your small intestine. A feeding tube can also be inserted into your bowel surgically, through an incision made in your tummy. This is known as a jejunostomy. Liquid food containing nutrients can be fed through the tube, which goes straight to your bowel to be absorbed, bypassing your stomach. Speak to your doctor about the risks and benefits of each type of feeding tube. An alternative feeding method for severe gastroparesis is intravenous (parenteral) nutrition, where liquid nutrients are passed straight into your bloodstream via a catheter (a tiny flexible tube) that is fed into a large vein. Surgery Some people may benefit from having an operation to insert a tube into the stomach through the tummy. This tube can be periodically opened to release gas and relieve bloating. Very occasionally, a procedure to create a new opening between your stomach and small intestine (gastroenterostomy) or to connect your stomach directly to the second part of your small intestine called the jejunum (gastrojejunostomy) may be recommended as a last resort. These procedures may reduce your symptoms by allowing food to move through your stomach more easily. Your doctor can explain whether any procedures are suitable for you, and they can discuss the possible risks involved. Advice for people with diabetes Having gastroparesis means your food is being absorbed slowly and at unpredictable times. If you also have diabetes, this can lead to wide swings in blood sugar levels, so it's important to ensure you tightly control your blood sugar levels. Your doctor can advise you about any changes you may need to make to your diet or medication. If you are taking insulin, you may need to divide your dose before and after meals and inject into areas from which absorption is typically slower (such as the thigh). You will also need to check your blood glucose levels frequently after you eat. In people with gastroparesis, food takes longer to pass through the stomach than usual  Community content from HealthUnlocked Digestive health Find out how to beat common digestive problems like bloating and indigestion Page last reviewed: 03\/11\/2014 Next review due: 03\/11\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's also sometimes referred to as an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.  The endoscope has a light and a camera at one end. The camera sends images of the inside of your oesophagus, stomach and duodenum to a monitor. Why a gastroscopy may be used  A gastroscopy can be used to: investigate problems such as difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) or persistent abdominal (tummy) pain diagnose conditions such as stomach ulcers or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) treat conditions such as bleeding ulcers, a blockage in the oesophagus, non-cancerous growths (polyps) or small cancerous tumours A gastroscopy used to check symptoms or confirm a diagnosis is known as a diagnostic gastroscopy. A gastroscopy used to treat a condition is known as a therapeutic gastroscopy. Read more about why a gastroscopy may be used. The gastroscopy procedure A gastroscopy often takes less than 15 minutes, although it may take longer if it's being used to treat a condition. It's usually carried out as an outpatient procedure, which means you won't have to spend the night in hospital. Before the procedure, your throat will be numbed with a local anaesthetic spray. You can also choose to have a sedative, if you prefer. This means you will still be awake, but will be drowsy and have reduced awareness about what's happening. The doctor carrying out the procedure will place the endoscope in the back of your mouth and ask you to swallow the first part of the tube. It will then be guided down your oesophagus and into your stomach. The procedure shouldn't be painful, but it may be unpleasant or uncomfortable at times.  Read more about how a gastroscopy is performed. What are the risks? A gastroscopy is a very safe procedure, but like all medical procedures it does carry a risk of complications. Possible complications that can occur include: a reaction to the sedative, which can cause problems with your breathing, heart rate and blood pressure internal bleeding tearing of the lining of your oesophagus, stomach or duodenum (perforation) However, serious problems are rare, occurring in less than 1 in every 1,000 cases.

Biological sex is assigned at birth, depending on the appearance of the genitals. Gender identity is the gender that a person \"identifies\" with or feels themselves to be. While biological sex and gender identity are the same for most people, this isn't the case for everyone. For example, some people may have the anatomy of a man, but identify themselves as a woman, while others may not feel they're definitively either male or female. This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. It's not a mental illness. Some people with gender dysphoria have a strong and persistent desire to live according to their gender identity, rather than their biological sex. These people are sometimes called transsexual or trans people. Some trans people have treatment to make their physical appearance more consistent with their gender identity. Signs of gender dysphoria The first signs of gender dysphoria can appear at a very young age. For example, a child may refuse to wear typical boys' or girls' clothes, or dislike taking part in typical boys' or girls' games and activities. In most cases, this type of behaviour is just a normal part of growing up and will pass in time, but for those with gender dysphoria it continues through childhood and into adulthood. Adults with gender dysphoria can feel trapped inside a body that doesn't match their gender identity. They may feel so unhappy about conforming to societal expectations that they live according to their anatomical sex, rather than the gender they feel themselves to be. They may also have a strong desire to change or get rid of physical signs of their biological sex, such as facial hair or breasts. Read more about the symptoms of gender dysphoria. Getting help See your GP if you think you or your child may have gender dysphoria. If necessary, they can refer you to a specialist Gender Identity Clinic (GIC). Staff at these clinics can carry out a personalised assessment and provide any support you need. Assessment A diagnosis of gender dysphoria can usually be made after an in-depth assessment carried out by two or more specialists. This may require several sessions, carried out a few months apart, and may involve discussions with people you are close to, such as members of your family or your partner. The assessment will determine whether you have gender dysphoria and what your needs are, which could include: whether there's a clear mismatch between your biological sex and gender identity whether you have a strong desire to change your physical characteristics as a result of any mismatch how you're coping with any difficulties of a possible mismatch how your feelings and behaviours have developed over time what support you have, such as friends and family The assessment may also involve a more general assessment of your physical and psychological health. Treatment for gender dysphoria If the results of an assessment suggest that you or your child have gender dysphoria, staff at the GIC will work with you to come up with an individual treatment plan. This will include any psychological support you may need. Treatment for gender dysphoria aims to help reduce or remove the distressing feelings of a mismatch between biological sex and gender identity. This can mean different things for different people. For some people, it can mean dressing and living as their preferred gender. For others, it can mean taking hormones or also having surgery to change their physical appearance. Many trans people have treatment to change their body permanently, so they're more consistent with their gender identity, and the vast majority are satisfied with the eventual results. Read more about treating gender dysphoria. What causes gender dysphoria? Gender development is complex and there are many possible variations that cause a mismatch between a person\u2019s biological sex and their gender identity, making the exact cause of gender dysphoria unclear. Occasionally, the hormones that trigger the development of biological sex may not work properly on the brain, reproductive organs and genitals, causing differences between them. This may be caused by: additional hormones in the mother\u2019s system \u2013 possibly as a result of taking medication the foetus\u2019 insensitivity to the hormones, known as androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) \u2013 when this happens, gender dysphoria may be caused by hormones not working properly in the womb Gender dysphoria may also be the result of other rare conditions, such as: congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) \u2013 where a high level of male hormones are produced in a female foetus. This causes the genitals to become more male in appearance and, in some cases, the baby may be thought to be biologically male when she is born. intersex conditions \u2013 which cause babies to be born with the genitalia of both sexes (or ambiguous genitalia). Parents are recommended to wait until the child can choose their own gender identity before any surgery is carried out. Read more about disorders of sex development. How common is gender dysphoria? It's not known exactly how many people experience gender dysphoria, because many people with the condition never seek help. A survey of 10,000 people undertaken in 2012 by the Equality and Human Rights Commission found that 1% of the population surveyed was gender variant, to some extent. While gender dysphoria appears to be rare, the number of people being diagnosed with the condition is increasing, due to growing public awareness. However, many people with gender dysphoria still face prejudice and misunderstanding. Gender terminology Gender dysphoria is a complex condition that can be difficult to understand. Therefore, it helps to distinguish between the meanings of different gender-related terms: gender dysphoria \u2013 discomfort or distress caused by a mismatch between a person\u2019s gender identity and their biological sex assigned at birth transsexualism \u2013 the desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex, usually accompanied by the wish to have treatment to make their physical appearance more consistent with their gender identity transvestism \u2013 where a person occasionally wears clothes typically associated with the opposite gender (cross-dressing) for a variety of reasons genderqueer \u2013 an umbrella term used to describe gender identities other than man and woman \u2013 for example, those who are both man and woman, or neither man nor woman, or moving between genders Gender dysphoria isn't the same as transvestism or cross-dressing and isn't related to sexual orientation. People with the condition may identify as straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual or asexual, and this may change with treatment.

During a general anaesthetic, medications are used to send you to sleep, so you're unaware of surgery and don't move or feel pain while it's carried out. General anaesthesia is essential for some surgical procedures where it may be safer or more comfortable for you to be unconscious. It's usually used for long operations or those that would otherwise be very painful. It's not clear exactly how it works, but it's known that all anaesthetics interrupt the passage of signals along the nerves. This means that any stimulation to the body doesn't get processed or recognised by the brain. How general anaesthetics are given Before having an operation, you'll meet a specialist doctor called an anaesthetist to discuss which anaesthetic is most suitable for you. Your anaesthetist will look at your medical history and will ask whether anyone in your family has had problems with anaesthesia. They'll also ask about your general health and lifestyle, including whether you: have any allergies smoke or drink alcohol are taking any other medication Your anaesthetist can answer any questions you have. Let them know if you're unsure about any part of the procedure or if you have any concerns. You should be given clear instructions to follow before the operation, including whether you can eat or drink anything in the hours leading up to it. Before and during your operation Just before you have surgery, you'll usually be taken to a room where your anaesthetist will give you the general anaesthetic.  It will either be given as a: liquid that's injected into your veins through a cannula (a thin, plastic tube that feeds into a vein, usually on the back of your hand) gas that you breathe in through a mask The anaesthetic should take effect very quickly. You'll start feeling light-headed, before becoming unconscious within a minute or so. Your anaesthetist will stay with you throughout the procedure. They'll make sure you continue to receive the anaesthetic and that you stay in a controlled state of unconsciousness. They'll also give you painkilling medicine into your veins, so that you're comfortable when you wake up. Recovery After your operation, the anaesthetist will stop the anaesthetic and you'll gradually wake up. You'll usually be in a recovery room at first, before being transferred to a ward. Depending on your circumstances, you'll usually need to stay in hospital for a few hours to a few days after your operation. General anaesthetics can affect your memory, concentration and reflexes for a day or two, so it's important for a responsible adult to stay with you for at least 24 hours after your operation, if you're allowed to go home. You'll also be advised to avoid driving, drinking alcohol and signing any legal documents for 24-48 hours. Side effects General anaesthetics have some common side effects. Your anaesthetist should discuss these with you before your surgery. Most side effects occur immediately after your operation and don't last long. Possible side effects include: feeling sick and vomiting \u2013 this usually occurs immediately, although some people may continue to feel sick for up to a day shivering and feeling cold \u2013 this may last a few minutes or hours confusion and memory loss \u2013 this is more common in elderly people or those with existing memory problems; it's usually temporary, but occasionally can be longer lasting bladder problems \u2013 you may have difficulty passing urine dizziness \u2013 you will be given fluids to treat this bruising and soreness \u2013 this may develop in the area where you were injected or had a drip fitted; it usually heals without treatment sore throat \u2013 during your operation, a tube may be inserted either into your mouth or down your throat to help you breathe; afterwards, this can cause a sore throat damage to the mouth or teeth \u2013 a small proportion of people may have small cuts to their lips or tongue from the tube, and some may have damage to their teeth; you should tell your anaesthetist about any dental work you have had done Complications and risks A number of more serious complications are associated with general anaesthetics. These are rare, occurring in less than 1 in every 10,000 cases. Possible serious complications and risks include: a serious allergic reaction to the anaesthetic (anaphylaxis) an inherited reaction to the anaesthetic that causes breathing difficulties waking up during your operation \u2013 but this is rare, and the amount of anaesthetic given will be continuously monitored to help ensure this doesn't happen death \u2013 this is very rare, occurring in 1 in every 100,000 to 1 in every 200,000 cases Serious problems are more likely to occur if you're having major or emergency surgery, you have any other illnesses, you smoke, or you're overweight. Your anaesthetist will discuss the risks with you before your operation. You should try to stop smoking or drinking alcohol in the weeks before surgery, as doing so will reduce your risk of developing complications. You may also be advised to lose weight, and if you can you should increase your activity levels in the weeks before surgery, as this is likely to reduce your risk as well. In most cases, the benefits of being pain-free during an operation outweigh the risks. Other types of anaesthetic As well as general anaesthetic, there are several other types of anaesthetic, which can be used for certain procedures. They include: local anaesthetic epidural anaesthetic spinal anaesthetic nerve blocks  Page last reviewed: 08\/05\/2015 Next review due: 08\/05\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Everyone has feelings of anxiety at some point in their life \u2013 for example, you may feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam, or having a medical test or job interview. During times like these, feeling anxious can be perfectly normal. However, some people find it hard to control their worries. Their feelings of anxiety are more constant and can often affect their daily lives. Anxiety is the main symptom of several conditions, including: panic disorder phobias \u2013 such as agoraphobia or claustrophobia  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) social anxiety disorder (social phobia) However, the information in this section is about a specific condition called generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is a long-term condition that causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event.  People with GAD feel anxious most days and often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed. As soon as one anxious thought is resolved, another may appear about a different issue. GAD can cause both psychological (mental) and physical symptoms. These vary from person to person, but can include: feeling restless or worried having trouble concentrating or sleeping dizziness or heart palpitations Read about the symptoms of GAD. When to see your GP Although feelings of anxiety at certain times are completely normal, see your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or causing you distress. Your GP will ask about your symptoms and your worries, fears and emotions to find out if you could have GAD. Read more about diagnosing GAD. What causes GAD? The exact cause of GAD isn't fully understood, although it's likely that a combination of several factors plays a role. Research has suggested that these may include: overactivity in areas of the brain involved in emotions and behaviour an imbalance of the brain chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline, which are involved in the control and regulation of mood the genes you inherit from your parents \u2013 you're estimated to be five times more likely to develop GAD if you have a close relative with the condition having a history of stressful or traumatic experiences, such as domestic violence, child abuse or bullying having a painful long-term health condition, such as arthritis having a history of drug or alcohol misuse However, many people develop GAD for no apparent reason. Who is affected? GAD is a common condition, estimated to affect up to 5% of the UK population. Slightly more women are affected than men, and the condition is more common in people from the ages of 35 to 59. How GAD is treated GAD can have a significant effect on your daily life, but several different treatments are available that can ease your symptoms. These include: psychological therapy \u2013 such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) medication \u2013 such as a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) There are also many things you can do yourself to help reduce your anxiety, such as:  going on a self-help course exercising regularly stopping smoking cutting down on the amount of alcohol and caffeine you drink Read how stopping smoking can improve your anxiety. With treatment, many people are able to control their anxiety levels. However, some treatments may need to be continued for a long time and there may be periods when your symptoms worsen.

Inheriting faulty versions or \"variants\" of these genes significantly raises your risk of developing cancer, because the altered genes cannot repair the damaged cells, which can build up and form a tumour. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two examples of genes that raise your cancer risk if they become altered. Having a variant BRCA gene greatly increases a woman's chance of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. This was the reason Angelina Jolie had preventative breast cancer surgery, followed by ovarian cancer surgery. They also increase a man's chance of developing male breast cancer and prostate cancer.  BRCA genes are not the only cancer risk genes. Researchers recently identified more than 100 new gene variants associated with an increased risk of breast, prostate and ovarian cancer. Individually, these new gene variants only slightly increase the risk of cancer, but a combination could mean a high risk overall. If you or your partner have a high-risk cancer gene, such as an altered version of BRCA1, it can be passed on to any children you have.  If you're concerned, read on. This page covers: What to do if you're worried  Pros and cons of having a predictive genetic test  What testing involves  What a positive result means   Managing your risk  Telling close relatives  Planning a family  Paying for private testing What to do if you're worried  Speak to your GP if cancer runs in your family and you're worried you may get it too. They may refer you to a local genetics service for an NHS genetic test, which will tell you if you have inherited one of the cancer risk genes.  This type of testing is known as predictive genetic testing. It's \"predictive\" because a positive result means you have a greatly increased risk of developing cancer. It doesn't mean you have cancer or are definitely going to develop it. You may be eligible for this NHS test if the faulty gene has already been identified in one of your relatives, or if there is a strong family history of cancer in your family. See What testing involves, below. Pros and cons of having a predictive genetic test  Not everyone who is eligible for the NHS test will want to have it. It's a personal decision, and should only be made after you've had genetic counselling sessions and talked through what having the test means, how you may feel and how you will cope. Advantages a positive result means you can take steps to manage your risk of developing cancer \u2013 you can make certain lifestyle changes to lower your risk, have regular screening and have preventative treatment (see Managing your risk, below) knowing the result may reduce any stress and anxiety that comes from not knowing Disadvantages the results of some genetic tests are inconclusive \u2013 doctors may identify a variation in a gene, but not know what effect it may have a positive result may cause permanent anxiety \u2013 some people would rather not know about their risk and only want to be told if they actually develop cancer What testing involves   There are usually two steps to genetic testing: A relative with cancer has a diagnostic blood test to see if they have a cancer risk gene (this normally must happen before any healthy relatives are tested). Their result will be ready four to eight weeks later. If your relative's test is positive, you can have the predictive genetic test to see if you have the same faulty gene. Your GP will refer you to your local genetics service for the blood test (you'll need a copy of your relative's test results). The result will take up to two weeks to come through after a blood sample is taken, but this may not happen at your first appointment. This test is fully predictive as a \"clear\" negative test, which will mean you have not inherited the family high risk of cancer. The charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer explains the importance of these two steps: \"Without looking at the genes of an affected relative first, testing a healthy individual would be like reading through an entire book looking for a spelling mistake without knowing where the mistake is, or if there is a mistake at all.\" When there are no affected relatives available, full testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 may be possible for those with at least a 10% chance of having a genetic fault. This usually means having a very strong family history of early onset breast and particularly ovarian cancer. It takes four to eight weeks to get the result, but this is not fully predictive as a negative test, so cannot rule out that the problem in relatives is due to a different gene. What a positive result means  If your predictive genetic test result is positive, it means you have a faulty gene that raises your risk of developing cancer. It doesn't mean you are guaranteed to get cancer \u2013 your genes only partly influence your future health risks. Other factors, such as your medical history, lifestyle and your environment, also play a role. If you have one of the faulty BRCA genes, there is a 50% chance you will pass this on to any children you have and a 50% chance that each of your siblings also has it. You may want to discuss your results with other members of your family, who may also be affected. The genetics clinic will discuss with you how a positive or negative result will affect your life and your relationships with your family. You can read more about this in the beginner's guide to BRCA1 and BRCA2 (PDF, 866kb) produced by The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. Insurance companies cannot ask you to disclose the results of predictive genetic tests for the majority of policies, but this may change in the future. Managing your risk   If your test result is positive, you have a range of options to manage your risk. Risk-reducing surgery is not the only option. Ultimately, there's no right or wrong answer about what you should do \u2013 it's a decision only you can make. Regularly examining your breasts If you have the faulty BRCA1\/2 gene, it's a good idea to be aware of changes in your breasts. Read more about being breast cancer aware. This advice applies to men with a faulty BRCA2 gene too, as they are also at increased risk of breast cancer (although to a lesser extent). Screening In the case of breast cancer, annual breast screening in the form of mammograms and MRI scans can also monitor your condition and catch cancer early, if it does develop. Detecting breast cancer at an early stage means it may be easier to treat. The chance of making a full recovery from breast cancer, especially if it is detected early, is relatively high compared with other forms of cancer. Unfortunately, there's currently no reliable screening test for ovarian cancer or prostate cancer. Read more about screening for prostate cancer. However, annual PSA tests for prostate cancer may benefit men who carry the faulty BRCA2 gene. Lifestyle changes Changes in your lifestyle can sometimes reduce your individual cancer risk. These include taking plenty of exercise and eating a healthy diet. If you have a faulty BRCA gene, be aware of other factors that could increase your risk of breast cancer. It's recommended that you avoid: the oral contraceptive pill if you are over 35 combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) if you\u2019re over 50 drinking more than the maximum recommended daily limits of alcohol being overweight The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also recommends that women with a family history of breast cancer breastfeed their children, if possible. Read about the things that may help to prevent ovarian cancer. Medication (chemoprevention) NICE has recommended treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene for a specific group of women who have a high risk of developing breast cancer. These medicines can reduce the risk of breast cancer for up to 20 years from five years of taking them. For more information, read the article: Drugs to be offered to women at high risk of breast cancer, which also explains the side effects these medicines can cause. Read the full NICE 2013 guidelines on familial breast cancer.   Risk-reducing surgery Risk-reducing surgery means removing all the tissue (such as the breasts or ovaries) that could become cancerous. Carriers of a faulty BRCA gene may wish to consider a preventative mastectomy.   Women who have risk-reducing mastectomies reduce their risk of developing breast cancer by around 90%. However, a mastectomy is a major operation and recovering from it can be physically and emotionally difficult. Surgery can also be used to reduce ovarian cancer risk. Women who have their ovaries removed before the menopause not only dramatically reduce their risk of developing ovarian cancer, but also reduce their risk of developing breast cancer by up to 50%. However, this will trigger an early menopause and mean you're not able to have your own children (unless you store eggs or embryos). Read more about surgery to remove the ovaries, including the risks and after-effects. The risk of ovarian cancer in women who carry a BRCA gene fault does not begin to rise significantly until about the age of 40. Therefore, carriers of the faulty gene who are younger than 40 usually wait to have this operation. Telling close relatives   Your genetics unit will not approach your relatives about your result \u2013 it will usually be up to you to tell your family. You may be given a standard letter to share with relatives, which explains your test result and contains all the information they need to be referred for the test themselves. However, not everyone will want to have the genetic test. Women who are closely related to you (such as your sister or daughter) can have cancer screening without having genetic testing. Planning a family  Cancer risk genes can be passed on to any children you have. If your predictive genetic test is positive and you want to start a family, you have several options. You can: Have your children without any intervention, and risk your child inheriting the faulty gene. Adopt a baby. Use donor eggs or donor sperm (depending on who carries the faulty gene) to avoid passing on the faulty gene. Have prenatal testing, which is a test done in pregnancy that reveals whether your baby has the faulty gene. You can then plan to continue or terminate the pregnancy, depending on the test result. Have pre-implantation genetic diagnosis \u2013 a technique used to select embryos that have not inherited the faulty gene. However, there is no guarantee this technique will result in a successful pregnancy, and funding for it on the NHS may not be available to all patients. Paying for private testing If there isn't a strong family history of cancer in your family and the faulty gene hasn't otherwise been identified in any of your relatives, you won't be eligible for the NHS genetic test. You'll have to pay for it privately if you still wish to have the test. Consider this carefully, because: if you don't have any family history of cancer, it's unlikely you have one of the faulty genes the tests can be expensive, potentially costing up to £500-2,000 or more there's no guarantee they will predict whether you'll develop cancer you may not be offered genetic counselling to help you make a decision and support you once you get your results About BRCA1 and BRCA2 If you have a fault (mutation) in one of the BRCA genes, your risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer is greatly increased.   Women with the faulty BRCA1 gene, for example, have a 60-90% lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 40-60% risk of ovarian cancer. In other words, out of every 100 women with the faulty BRCA1 gene, between 60 and 90 will develop breast cancer in their lifetime and between 40 and 60 will develop ovarian cancer. The faulty BRCA genes affect around 1 in every 400 people, but people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are at a much higher risk (as many as 1 in 40 may carry the faulty gene). For more information, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust has produced a beginner's guide to BRCA1 and BRCA2 (PDF, 867kb).

About genes Your genes are a set of instructions for the growth and development of every cell in your body. For example, they determine characteristics such as your blood group and the colour of your eyes and hair. However, many characteristics aren't due to genes alone \u2013 environment also plays an important role. For example, children may inherit 'tall genes' from their parents, but if their diet doesn't provide them with the necessary nutrients, they may not grow very tall. Chromosomes Genes are packaged in bundles called chromosomes. In humans, each cell in the body contains 23 pairs of chromosomes \u2013 46 in total. You inherit one of each pair of chromosomes from your mother and one from your father. This means there are two copies of every gene in each cell, with the exception of the sex chromosomes, X and Y. The X and Y chromosomes determine the biological sex of a baby. Babies with a Y chromosome (XY) will be male, whereas those without a Y chromosome will be female (XX). This means that males only have one copy of each X chromosome gene, rather than two, and they have a few genes found only on the Y chromosome and play an important role in male development. Occasionally, individuals inherit more than one sex chromosome. Females with three X chromosomes (XXX) and males with an extra Y (XYY) are normal, and most never know they have an extra chromosome. However, females with one X have a condition known as Turner syndrome, and males with an extra X have Klinefelter syndrome. The whole set of genes is known as the genome. Humans have about 21,000 genes on their 23 chromosomes, so the human genome contains two copies of those 21,000 (except for those on X and Y in males). DNA Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the long molecule found inside chromosomes that stores genetic information. It is tightly coiled into a \u2018double helix\u2019 shape, which looks like a twisted ladder. Each 'rung' of the ladder is made up of a combination of four chemicals \u2013 adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine \u2013 which are represented as the letters A, T, C and G. These 'letters' are ordered in particular sequences within your genes and they contain the instructions to make a particular protein, in a particular cell, at a particular time. Proteins are complex chemicals that are the building blocks of the body. For example, keratin is the protein in hair and nails, while haemoglobin is the red protein in blood. There are around six billion letters of DNA code within each cell. Genes and medical conditions As well as determining characteristics such as eye and hair colour, your genes can also directly cause or increase your risk of a wide range of medical conditions. Although not always the case, many of these conditions occur when a child inherits a specific altered (mutated) version of a particular gene from one or both of their parents. Examples of conditions directly caused by genetic mutations include: muscular dystrophy \u2013 which causes the muscles to weaken over time, leading to an increasing level of disability Down's syndrome \u2013 which affects a child's normal physical development and causes learning difficulties cystic fibrosis \u2013 a condition in which the lungs and digestive system become clogged with thick sticky mucus There are also many conditions that are not directly caused by genetic mutations, but can occur as the result of a combination of an inherited genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, such as a poor diet, smoking and a lack of exercise. Read more about how genes are inherited. Genetic testing Genetic testing can be used to find out whether you are carrying a particular genetic mutation that causes a medical condition. This can be useful for a number of purposes, including diagnosing certain genetic conditions, predicting your likelihood of developing a certain condition and determining if any children you have are at risk of developing an inherited condition. Testing usually involves taking a blood or tissue sample and analysing the DNA in your cells. Genetic testing can also be carried to find out if a foetus is likely to be born with a certain genetic condition by extracting and testing a sample of cells from the womb.

The initial project ran from 1990 to 2003. Its objective was to map the immense amount of genetic information found in every human cell. As well as identifying specific human genes, the Human Genome Project has enabled scientists to gain a better understanding of how certain traits and characteristics are passed on from parents to children.

It causes painful blisters on the genitals and the surrounding areas. As genital herpes can be passed to others through intimate sexual contact, it's often referred to as a sexually transmitted infection (STI). HSV can affect any mucous membrane (moist lining), such as those found in the mouth (cold sores). Genital herpes is a chronic (long-term) condition. The virus remains in your body and can become active again. The average rate of recurrence is four to five times in the first two years after being infected. However, over time, it tends to become active less frequently and each outbreak becomes less severe. Read more about the symptoms of genital herpes. The herpes simplex virus (HSV) There are two types of herpes simplex virus (HSV), type 1 and type 2. Both types are highly contagious and can be passed easily from one person to another by direct contact. Genital herpes is usually transmitted by having sex (vaginal, anal or oral) with an infected person. Even if someone with genital herpes doesn't have any symptoms, it's possible for them to pass the condition on to a sexual partner. At least eight out of 10 people who carry the virus are unaware they have been infected because there are often few or no initial symptoms. However, certain triggers can activate the virus, causing an outbreak of genital herpes. Read more about the causes of genital herpes. Who is affected? Genital herpes is a common condition, especially in people from 20 to 24 years old. In 2013, 32,279 people attended a sexual health clinic in England with an attack of genital herpes for the first time. Read more about how genital herpes is diagnosed. Treating genital herpes Although there's no cure for genital herpes, the symptoms can usually be controlled using antiviral medicines. However, it's important to prevent the spread of genital herpes by avoiding sex until symptoms have cleared up and continuing to use a condom afterwards. Read more about how genital herpes is treated. Pregnancy Genital herpes can cause problems during pregnancy. These complications can be more serious depending on whether you already have genital herpes, or develop it for the first time while pregnant. Read more about complications of genital herpes.

Genital warts are very common. In England, they are the second most common type of sexually transmitted infection (STI) after chlamydia. Genital warts are the result of a viral skin infection caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). They are usually painless and do not pose a serious threat to health. But they can be unpleasant to look at and cause psychological distress. There is no evidence that your fertility will be affected by genital warts. Read more about the symptoms of genital warts. The human papilloma virus (HPV) The HPV is not a single virus, but a family of more than 100 different strains of viruses. Different strains usually affect different parts of the body, including the hands or feet. Although around 30 different types of HPV can affect the genital skin, most cases of infection with HPV cause no visible symptoms. Around 90% of all cases of genital warts are caused by two strains of the virus \u2013 type 6 and type 11. The types of HPV that cause visible genital warts do not cause genital cancer. Other strains of HPV can cause cervical cancer. How do they spread? Genital warts can be spread during vaginal or anal sex, and by sharing sex toys. But you don't need to have penetrative sex to pass the infection on because HPV is spread by skin-to-skin contact. Read more about the causes of genital warts. It can take months, or even years, for warts to develop after infection with HPV. So if you're in a relationship and you get genital warts, it does not necessarily mean your partner has been having sex with other people. HPV is most likely to be transmitted to others when warts are present, although it is still possible to pass the virus on before the warts have developed and after they have disappeared. Condoms do not provide complete protection because it is possible for the skin around your genital area not covered by the condom to become infected. Read more about preventing genital warts. Treating genital warts If you think you have genital warts, see a health professional as they may need to be treated. It is possible to have more than one STI at a time, so if you think you have warts, it is a good idea to have a check-up. You can make an appointment at your local sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic. You can go to a sexual health clinic whatever age you are. If you're under 16, the service is still confidential and the clinic won't tell your parents. Find your local sexual health or GUM clinic. The treatment for genital warts depends on how many warts you have and where they are. Several treatments are available, such as liquids or creams and freezing the warts (cryotherapy). You should not use wart creams that are available over the counter because they are designed to only treat warts on the hands or verrucas. If you are diagnosed with genital warts, it is recommended you do not have sex, including anal and oral sex, until your genital warts have fully healed. This will help prevent you passing the infection on to others. It will also help speed up your recovery. Learn more in treating genital warts. Will the warts come back? Some people only ever get one episode of genital warts. For many others, the warts will come back weeks, months or years later. If you do develop a new wart, it is not possible to say if these are a result of the original infection or a new infection with HPV. Who is affected? Both men and women can be affected by genital warts. According to Public Health England, in 2012 there were 73,893 new cases of genital warts diagnosed by GUM clinics in England. This compares with 206,912 new cases of chlamydia in 2012. Genital warts are most common in sexually active teenagers and young adults. The highest rates of genital warts occur in men aged 20 to 24 years and women aged 16 to 19 years. HPV vaccinations HPV vaccines in the UK are offered to all girls in year 8 (aged 12 to 13 years). Since September 2012, the vaccine Gardasil has been used and can help protect against HPV types 6 and 11, which cause around 90% of genital warts. It also protects against types 16 and 18, which are linked to more than 70% of cases of cervical cancer in the UK. Before September 2012, a different vaccine called Cervarix was used to protect against HPV types 16 and 18. HPV vaccines cannot protect against all types of HPV. If you are a woman and have received HPV vaccinations, you should still attend cervical screening (smear tests) as the vaccines do not guarantee that you will not develop cervical cancer in the future.

If the pain is persistent and you haven't accidentally bitten or burnt your tongue, see your GP or dentist. There may be an underlying problem that needs treating, and your GP or dentist may be able to advise you about pain relief while you wait for it to get better. This page outlines the most likely causes of tongue pain, but you shouldn't use it to diagnose yourself with a condition \u2013 always leave that to a healthcare professional. Common causes Common causes of tongue pain are outlined below. Geographic tongue Also known as benign migratory glossitis or oral erythema migrans, geographic tongue is a common condition that causes irregular red patches surrounded by white lines to develop on the tongue, giving it a map-like appearance. In some people, the red patches may feel sore or sensitive to certain foods and drinks. You may notice that after a few days, weeks or months the position of these lines and patches change. They may disappear and re-appear later on a different part of the tongue. Some people find the condition improves over time, while for others it may be persistent. See your GP or dentist if you have persistent discoloured or painful patches on your tongue. It\u2019s not clear exactly what causes geographic tongue and there is no specific treatment for it, but you may be able to manage the pain by taking over-the-counter painkillers (speak to your pharmacist for advice) and avoiding anything that makes it worse, such as acidic, spicy or hot foods. Oral thrush Oral thrush is an infection in the mouth caused by a fungus, which can cause a coated or white tongue and areas of soreness. You are more likely to develop oral thrush if you: have recently taken antibiotics have poor oral hygiene wear dentures (false teeth), particularly if they don't fit properly have a weakened immune system have diabetes You should see your GP if you think you have oral thrush. If it is left untreated, the symptoms will persist and your mouth will continue to be uncomfortable. Oral thrush is treated with antifungal medicines taken for around a week. These usually come in the form of gels or liquid that you apply directly inside your mouth, although tablets or capsules are sometimes used. Aphthous mouth ulcers Aphthous mouth ulcers are painful sores that can occur anywhere within the mouth and are common on the underside of the tongue. Many mouth ulcers are caused by damage to the mouth, such as from accidentally biting your tongue or eating something hard and sharp. Ulcers that keep recurring have been linked to things such as stress, anxiety, hormone changes, certain foods and stopping smoking. Read more about the causes of mouth ulcers. Most mouth ulcers heal within a week or two and you may be able to manage the pain in the meantime by taking over-the-counter painkillers and avoiding anything that worsens it, such as spicy foods. See your GP or dentist if you have an ulcer that doesn\u2019t improve within a few weeks or if you develop ulcers regularly. Less common causes Less commonly, tongue pain may be caused by: a viral infection \u2013 such as an infection by viruses that cause hand, foot and mouth disease or cold sores vitamin deficiencies and anaemia \u2013 a sore tongue can sometimes be a symptom of iron deficiency anaemia and vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia median rhomboid glossitis \u2013 where a smooth, red, inflamed patch develops on the middle or back of the tongue, thought to result from a fungal infection glossodynia or \"burning mouth syndrome\" \u2013 a burning pain on the tip of the tongue that is often seen in people with depression glossopharyngeal neuralgia \u2013 repeated episodes of severe tongue pain believed to be caused by nerve irritation lichen planus \u2013 a long-term skin condition that causes an itchy rash and can also affect the mouth, causing a white lacy pattern and painful patches on the tongue Behçet's disease \u2013 a rare condition that causes inflammation of the blood vessels and can also lead to painful mouth ulcers  pemphigus vulgaris \u2013 a rare and serious condition that causes painful blisters to develop on the skin, as well as inside the mouth, nose, throat, anus and genitals medications \u2013 painful mouth ulcers can be a side effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and beta-blockers, and certain mouthwashes can cause tongue pain in some people Moeller's glossitis \u2013 a type of inflammation of the tongue cancer of the tongue \u2013 although this is rare Click on the above links for more information about these conditions and medications.

Symptoms of rubella include: a red-pink skin rash made up of small spots swollen glands around the head and neck a high temperature (fever) cold-like symptoms such as a cough and runny nose aching and painful joints \u2013 more common in adults The symptoms of rubella usually only last a few days, but your glands may be swollen for several weeks. Read more about the symptoms of rubella. When to see your GP You should always contact your GP or NHS 111 if you suspect rubella. Don't visit your GP surgery without phoning first, as arrangements may need to be made to reduce the risk of infecting others. If you're pregnant and develop a rash or come into contact with someone who has a rash, contact your GP or midwife immediately. Read more about diagnosing rubella. Rubella and pregnancy Rubella usually only becomes a serious concern if a pregnant woman catches the infection during the first 20 weeks of her pregnancy. This is because the rubella virus can disrupt the development of the baby and cause a wide range of health problems, including: eye problems \u2013 such as cataracts (cloudy patches on the lens of the eye) deafness heart abnormalities brain damage The birth defects caused by the rubella virus are known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Since the introduction of the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine, CRS is now very rare in the UK. Read more about the complications of rubella. How it spreads Rubella is caused by a type of virus called a togavirus. It's spread in a similar way to a cold or flu, through droplets of moisture from the nose or throat of someone who's infected. These droplets are released into the air when someone coughs, sneezes or talks. You can become infected if you come into contact with the droplets from an infected person, although it can take two to three weeks for symptoms to develop. If you have rubella, you'll be infectious to other people from one week before symptoms develop, and for up to four days after the rash first appeared. You should stay away from school or work for four days after the rash starts to avoid infecting others, and try to avoid contact with pregnant women during this time. Who's affected? Rubella is rare in the UK nowadays. Most cases occur in people who came to the UK from countries that don't offer routine immunisation against rubella. However, there can occasionally be large outbreaks of rubella in the UK. One of these occurred in 1996, when there were almost 4,000 cases in England and Wales. There were 12 confirmed cases of rubella in England and Wales in 2013. Treating rubella There's no specific treatment for rubella, but symptoms normally pass within 7 to 10 days. If you or your child are finding the symptoms uncomfortable, you can treat some of these at home while you wait for the infection to pass. For example, paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to reduce the fever and treat any aches or pains. Liquid infant paracetamol can be used for young children. Aspirin shouldn't be given to children under the age of 16 years. Read more about treating rubella. Preventing rubella The best way to prevent rubella is to be immunised with the MMR vaccine. Children are offered this vaccine as part of the routine childhood immunisation programme. It's given in two doses \u2013 the first when the child is one year old, followed by a second booster dose before they start school, at three years and four months. Routine vaccination is important because it reduces the risk of large outbreaks and helps protect pregnant women and their babies. The MMR vaccine can also be given to older children and adults who haven't been fully immunised before. Contact your GP if you're uncertain whether you or your child are up-to-date with vaccinations. If you're thinking of getting pregnant and you're not sure whether you've had two doses of the MMR vaccine, it's a good idea to check with your GP practice. If your records show you haven't had two doses of MMR or there's no record, ask for the vaccinations. Read more about preventing rubella. Information about you If you or your child has rubella, your clinical team will pass information about you\/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

It can occur at any stage of pregnancy, but is more common in the second half. It occurs if your body cannot produce enough insulin \u2013 a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels \u2013 to meet the extra needs in pregnancy. Gestational diabetes can cause problems for you and your baby during and after birth. But the risk of these problems happening can be reduced if it's detected and well managed. This page covers: Who's at risk Symptoms How it can affect your pregnancy Screening Treatments Long-term effects Future pregnancies Who's at risk of gestational diabetes Any woman can develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy, but you're at an increased risk if: your body mass index (BMI) is above 30 \u2013 use the healthy weight calculator to work out your BMI you previously had a baby who weighed 4.5kg (10lbs) or more at birth you had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy one of your parents or siblings has diabetes your family origins are south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean or Middle Eastern If any of these apply to you, you should be offered screening for gestational diabetes during your pregnancy. Symptoms of gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes doesn't usually cause any symptoms. Most cases are only picked up when your blood sugar level is tested during screening for gestational diabetes. Some women may develop symptoms if their blood sugar level gets too high (hyperglycaemia), such as: increased thirst needing to pee more often than usual a dry mouth tiredness But some of these symptoms are common during pregnancy anyway and aren't necessarily a sign of a problem. Speak to your midwife or doctor if you're worried about any symptoms you're experiencing. How gestational diabetes can affect your pregnancy Most women with gestational diabetes have otherwise normal pregnancies with healthy babies. However, gestational diabetes can cause problems such as: your baby growing larger than usual \u2013 this may lead to difficulties during the delivery and increases the likelihood of needing induced labour or a caesarean section polyhydramnios \u2013 too much amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby) in the womb, which can cause premature labour or problems at delivery premature birth \u2013 giving birth before the 37th week of pregnancy pre-eclampsia \u2013 a condition that causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and can lead to pregnancy complications if not treated your baby developing low blood sugar or yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) after he or she is born, which may require treatment in hospital the loss of your baby (stillbirth) \u2013 though this is rare Having gestational diabetes also means you're at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. Screening for gestational diabetes During your first antenatal appointment at around weeks 8 to 12 of your pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will ask you some questions to determine whether you're at an increased risk of gestational diabetes. If you have one or more risk factors for gestational diabetes \u2013 see Who's at risk, above \u2013 you should be offered a screening test. The screening test used is called an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which takes about two hours. It involves having a blood test taken in the morning when you've had nothing to eat or drink (except water) overnight. You're then given a glucose drink.  After resting for two hours, another blood sample is taken to see how your body is dealing with the glucose. The OGTT is done when you're between 24 and 28 weeks pregnant. If you've had gestational diabetes before, you'll be offered an OGTT earlier in pregnancy soon after your booking visit, and another OGTT at 24 to 28 weeks if the first test is normal. Alternatively, it may be suggested that you start testing your blood sugar yourself using a finger-pricking device in the same way as you did during your previous episode of gestational diabetes. Treatments for gestational diabetes In women with gestational diabetes, the chances of having problems with the pregnancy can be reduced by controlling blood sugar levels. You'll be given a blood sugar testing kit so you can monitor the effects of treatment. Blood sugar levels can be reduced by changes in diet and exercise.  But the majority of women will need medication as well if changes in diet and exercise don't reduce blood sugar enough. This may be tablets or insulin injections. You'll also be more closely monitored during your pregnancy and birth to check for any potential problems. If you have gestational diabetes, it's best to give birth before 41 weeks. Induction of labour or a caesarean section may be recommended if labour doesn't start naturally by this time. Earlier delivery may be recommended if there are concerns about your or your baby's health or if your blood sugar levels haven't been well controlled. Read more about how gestational diabetes is treated. Long-term effects of gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes normally goes away after birth. But women who've had it are more likely to develop: gestational diabetes again in future pregnancies type 2 diabetes \u2013 a lifelong type of diabetes You should have a blood test to check for diabetes 6 to 13 weeks after giving birth, and every year thereafter if the result is normal. See your GP if you develop symptoms of high blood sugar, such as increased thirst, needing to pee more often than usual, and a dry mouth \u2013 don't wait until your next test.  You should have the tests even if you feel well, as many people with diabetes don't have any symptoms.  You'll also be advised about things you can do to reduce your risk of developing diabetes, such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly. Some research has suggested that babies of mothers who had gestational diabetes may be more likely to develop diabetes or become obese later in life. Planning future pregnancies If you've had gestational diabetes before and you're planning to get pregnant, make sure you get checked for diabetes. Your GP can arrange this. If you do have diabetes, you should be referred to a diabetes pre-conception clinic for support to ensure your condition is well controlled before you get pregnant. Read more about diabetes in pregnancy. If you have an unplanned but wanted pregnancy, talk to your GP and tell them you had gestational diabetes in your previous pregnancy.   If tests show you don't have diabetes, you'll be offered screening earlier in pregnancy soon after your booking visit, and a repeat screening test at 24 to 28 weeks if the first test is normal. Alternatively, it may be suggested that you start testing your blood glucose yourself using a finger-pricking device in the same way as you did during your previous gestational diabetes.

Glucose comes from the digestion of starchy foods, such as bread and rice. Insulin, a hormone produced by your pancreas, helps your body to use glucose for energy. Three types of diabetes can affect you when you're pregnant: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes \u2013 long-term conditions that women may have before they get pregnant (pre-existing diabetes) gestational diabetes \u2013 develops only in pregnancy and goes away after the baby is born The information on this page is for women who have pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy. Most women with diabetes have a healthy baby, but diabetes does give you a higher risk of some complications. If you already have diabetes If you already have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, you may be at a higher risk of:   having a large baby \u2013 which increases the risk of a difficult birth, having your labour induced, or a caesarean section  having a miscarriage People with type 1 diabetes may develop problems with their eyes (diabetic retinopathy) and their kidneys (diabetic nephropathy), or existing problems may get worse. If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, your baby may be at risk of: not developing normally and having congenital abnormalities, particularly heart and nervous system abnormalities being stillborn or dying soon after birth having health problems shortly after birth, such as heart and breathing problems, and needing hospital care developing obesity or diabetes later in life Reducing the risks if you have pre-existing diabetes The best way to reduce the risk to your own and your baby's health is to ensure your diabetes is controlled before you become pregnant.  Ask your GP or diabetes specialist (diabetologist) for advice. You should be referred to a diabetic pre-conception clinic for support before you try to get pregnant.  Find diabetes support services near you. You should be offered a blood test called an HbA1c test, which helps assess the level of glucose in your blood. It's best if the level is no more than 6.5% before you get pregnant, as long as this does not cause problems with hypoglycaemia. If your HbA1c is higher than this, you would benefit from getting your blood glucose under better control before you conceive to reduce the risk of complications for you and your baby. Your GP or diabetes specialist can advise you on how best to do this. If your HbA1c is very high (above 10%), your care team should strongly advise you not to try for a baby until it has fallen. Folic acid Women with diabetes should take a higher dose of folic acid. The normal daily dose for women trying to get pregnant and for pregnant women is 400 micrograms. Diabetic women should take 5 milligrams (mg) a day. Your doctor can prescribe this high-dose folic acid for you, as 5mg tablets are not available over the counter. Taking folic acid helps prevent your baby developing birth defects, such as spina bifida. You should take folic acid while you are trying to get pregnant, until you are 12 weeks pregnant. Your diabetes treatment in pregnancy Your diabetic treatment regime is likely to need adjusting during your pregnancy, depending on your needs.  If you take drugs for conditions related to your diabetes, such as high blood pressure, these may have to be altered. It's very important to keep any appointments that are made for you so your care team can monitor your condition and react to any changes that could affect your own or your baby's wellbeing. Expect to monitor your blood glucose levels more frequently during pregnancy. Your eyes and kidneys will be screened more often to check they are not deteriorating in pregnancy, as eye and kidney problems can get worse.  You may also find that as you get better control over your diabetes you have more low blood sugar (hypoglycaemic) attacks. These are harmless for your baby, but you and your partner need to know how to cope with them.  Find out about treating a hypoglycaemic attack, and talk to your doctor or diabetes specialist. Diabetic eye screening in pregnancy You will be offered diabetic eye screening at recommended intervals during pregnancy if you had diabetes before you got pregnant (pre-existing diabetes). This screening test is to check for signs of diabetic eye disease, including diabetic retinopathy. Everyone with diabetes is offered diabetic eye screening, but screening is very important when you are pregnant because the risk of serious eye problems is greater in pregnancy. Diabetic eye screening is strongly recommended in pregnancy. It is part of managing your diabetes, and diabetic retinopathy is treatable, especially if it is caught early. If you decide not to have the test, you should tell the clinician looking after your diabetes care during pregnancy. Read more about diabetic eye screening. Labour and birth If you have diabetes, it's strongly recommended that you give birth with the support of a consultant-led maternity team in a hospital.  Read more about where you can give birth, including in hospital. Babies born to diabetic mothers are often larger than normal. This is because blood glucose passes directly from you to your baby, so if you have high blood glucose levels your baby will produce extra insulin to compensate. This can lead to your baby storing more fat and tissue. This in turn can lead to birth difficulties, which requires the expertise of a hospital team. After the birth Two to four hours after your baby is born they will have a heel prick blood test to check whether their blood glucose level is too low. Feed your baby as soon as possible after the birth \u2013 within 30 minutes \u2013 to help keep your baby's blood glucose at a safe level. If your baby's blood glucose can't be kept at a safe level, they may need extra care. Your baby may be given a drip to increase their blood glucose.  Read more about special care for babies.  When your pregnancy is over, you won't need as much insulin to control your blood glucose. You can decrease your insulin to your pre-pregnancy dose or, if you have type 2 diabetes, you can return to the tablets you were taking before you became pregnant. Talk to your doctor about this. If you had gestational diabetes, you can stop all treatment after the birth. You should be offered a test to check your blood glucose levels before you go home and at your six-week postnatal check. You should also be given advice on diet and exercise. Page last reviewed: 18\/03\/2015 Next review due: 18\/03\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's sometimes called temporal arteritis because the arteries around the temples are usually affected. The condition is one of the most common types of inflammation of the arteries and veins (vasculitis). Symptoms of giant cell arteritis include: aching and soreness in and around the temples jaw muscle pain while eating vision loss These can often develop suddenly, but may follow vague symptoms such as weight loss and prolonged tiredness. Read more about the symptoms of giant cell arteritis. When to see your GP Giant cell arteritis needs urgent medical attention and treatment with steroids. Without prompt treatment it can lead to permanent visual impairment. Contact your GP as soon as possible if you suddenly develop a severe headache, jaw pain when eating, blurred or double vision, or a sore scalp. If this isn't possible, contact your out-of-hours service or call NHS 111. Diagnosis and treatment Treatment for giant cell arteritis will usually begin as soon as possible. This may mean that treatment begins before a diagnosis is confirmed. An examination of your symptoms and blood tests may be carried out if it's thought you have giant cell arteritis. The most effective way to diagnose the condition is to remove some tissue from your temporal artery so it can be studied. This procedure is known as a temporal artery biopsy. The main treatment for giant cell arteritis is steroid medication (corticosteroids). Most people need to take steroids on a long-term basis to prevent their symptoms returning. A two-year course of corticosteroids is usually required. Other types of medication, such as low-dose aspirin and medication that suppresses the immune system (immunosuppressants), may also be used to reduce the risk of the condition recurring and complications developing. Read more about diagnosing giant cell arteritis and treating giant cell arteritis. Complications The damage to the blood vessels in giant cell arteritis can increase the risk of serious problems developing. These include permanent sight loss, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and cardiovascular disease. Read more about the possible complications of giant cell arteritis. Who's affected by giant cell arteritis? In the UK, it's estimated about 1 in every 4,500 people will develop giant cell arteritis each year. It only tends to affect adults over the age of 50, and those who develop the condition are usually over 60. Giant cell arteritis is three times more common in women than in men. It's also seven times more common in white people than in black people. Information about you If you have giant cell arteritis, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Polymyalgia rheumatica Around half of people with giant cell arteritis also develop polymyalgia rheumatic (PMR), a related but less serious condition. Polymyalgia rheumatica causes inflammation of the muscles and sometimes the joints, resulting in symptoms that can include shoulder, neck and hip pain, and stiffness of the affected muscles (which is often most obvious after waking up). The symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica can develop before, after, or at the same time as the symptoms of giant cell arteritis.

Diarrhoea is the most common symptom of giardiasis. Other symptoms can include: abdominal cramps foul-smelling flatulence and belching nausea (feeling sick) bloating indigestion fatigue (extreme tiredness) dehydration loss of appetite weight loss caused by malnutrition You may also experience vomiting and a mild fever of 37-38C (98.6-100.4F) but these symptoms are less common. Although these symptoms are often unpleasant, giardiasis doesn't usually pose a serious threat to health and can be easily treated. When to see a doctor See your GP if you have symptoms of diarrhoea, cramps, bloating and nausea that last for more than a week, particularly if you've recently travelled abroad. If your baby or child has diarrhoea lasting for more than two or three days, or they've had six or more episodes of diarrhoea in the last 24 hours, take them to see your GP. Your GP may have to send stool samples to be tested in a laboratory to diagnose giardiasis. Up to three samples may need to be taken over a number of days to confirm giardiasis. Treating giardiasis Giardiasis is usually treated successfully with antibiotic medicine that kills the giardia parasite. In most cases, medicines called metronidazole or tinidazole are used. Nausea is the most common side effect of metronidazole. On rare occasions, some people may also feel dizzy or sleepy. If this happens to you, avoid driving or using power tools or machinery. Don't drink alcohol while taking metronidazole or tinidazole, or for 48 hours after finishing your dose. Mixing alcohol with these types of medication can make the side effects worse. If you're diagnosed with giardiasis, other members of your household may be advised to have treatment. This may be recommended as a precautionary measure in case they've also been infected. Your GP will be able to tell you if treatment is necessary. How is giardiasis spread? Most people become infected with giardiasis by drinking water contaminated with the Giardia parasite, or through direct contact with an infected person. The giardiasis infection can also be passed on if an infected person doesn't wash their hands properly after using the toilet, then handles food eaten by others. Food can also be contaminated if it is washed with infected water. Practising good hygiene \u2013 such as regularly washing your hands with soap and water \u2013 and taking care when drinking water in countries with poor levels of sanitation can help to reduce your risk of developing giardiasis. Read more about the causes of giardiasis and preventing giardiasis. Who is affected? Giardiasis occurs almost everywhere in the world, but is particularly widespread where access to clean water is limited and sanitation is poor. It can affect people of all ages but is most common in young children and their parents. This is because things like nappy changing increase the risk of infection. There are more than 3,500 cases of giardiasis reported in England and Wales each year, although the true number is likely to be higher as many cases go undiagnosed. Around one quarter of these cases are thought to be contracted abroad, but many people don't develop the symptoms until they return home. Most cases of giardiasis are one-offs, but small outbreaks can occur in households, among family members, or at nurseries. Larger outbreaks are usually traced to contaminated water sources, such as drinking wells or water parks. Risk areas for giardiasis Places where giardiasis is widespread include: sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 all the countries south of the Sahara desert, such as South Africa, Gambia and Kenya south and southeast Asia, particularly India and Nepal Central America South America Russia Turkey Romania Bulgaria the countries of the former Yugoslavia (Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina) Page last reviewed: 02\/01\/2015 Next review due: 02\/01\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Bilirubin is a yellow substance found naturally in the blood. It forms as a by-product when old red blood cells are broken down. Symptoms of Gilbert's syndrome Most people with Gilbert's syndrome experience occasional and short-lived episodes of jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) due to the build-up of bilirubin in the blood. As Gilbert's syndrome usually only causes a slight increase in bilirubin levels, the yellowing of jaundice is often mild. The eyes are usually affected most. Some people also report other problems during episodes of jaundice, including: abdominal (tummy) pain feeling very tired (fatigue) loss of appetite feeling sick dizziness irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \u2013 a common digestive disorder that causes stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and constipation problems concentrating and thinking clearly (brain fog) a general sense of feeling unwell However, these problems aren't necessarily thought to be directly related to increased bilirubin levels, and could indicate a condition other than Gilbert\u2019s syndrome. Around one in three people with Gilbert\u2019s syndrome don't experience any symptoms at all. Therefore, you may not realise you have the syndrome until tests for an unrelated problem are carried out. When to see your GP Although jaundice caused by Gilbert's syndrome is usually mild, jaundice can sometimes be associated with more serious liver problems, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis C. You should therefore seek immediate medical advice from your GP if you experience an episode of jaundice for the first time. If this isn't possible, contact NHS 111 or your local out-of-hours service for advice. If you've been diagnosed with Gilbert\u2019s syndrome (see below), you don't usually need to seek medical advice during an episode of jaundice, unless you have additional or unusual symptoms. What causes Gilbert\u2019s syndrome? Gilbert\u2019s syndrome is a genetic disorder that's hereditary (it runs in families). People with the syndrome have a faulty gene which causes the liver to have problems removing bilirubin from the blood. Normally, when red blood cells reach the end of their life (after about 120 days), haemoglobin \u2013 the red pigment that carries oxygen in the blood \u2013 breaks down into bilirubin. The liver converts bilirubin into a water-soluble form, which passes into bile and is eventually removed from the body in urine or stools. Bilirubin gives urine its light yellow colour and stools their dark brown colour. In Gilbert\u2019s syndrome, the faulty gene means that bilirubin isn't passed into bile (a fluid produced by the liver to help with digestion) at the normal rate. Instead, it builds up in the bloodstream, giving the skin and white of the eyes a yellowish tinge. Other than inheriting the faulty gene, there are no known risk factors for developing Gilbert's syndrome. It isn't related to lifestyle habits, environmental factors or serious underlying liver problems, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis C. What triggers the symptoms? People with Gilbert\u2019s syndrome often find there are certain triggers that can bring on an episode of jaundice. Some of the possible triggers linked with the condition include: being dehydrated going without food for long periods of time (fasting) being ill with an infection being stressed physical exertion not getting enough sleep having surgery in women, having their monthly period Where possible, avoiding known triggers can reduce your chance of experiencing episodes of jaundice. Who's affected Gilbert\u2019s syndrome is common, but it's difficult to know exactly how many people are affected because it doesn't always cause obvious symptoms. In the UK, it's thought that at least 1 in 20 people (probably more) are affected by Gilbert's syndrome. Gilbert's syndrome affects more men than women. It's usually diagnosed during a person's late teens or early twenties. Diagnosing Gilbert's syndrome Gilbert\u2019s syndrome can be diagnosed using a blood test to measure the levels of bilirubin in your blood and a liver function test. When the liver is damaged, it releases enzymes into the blood. At the same time, levels of proteins that the liver produces to keep the body healthy begin to drop. By measuring the levels of these enzymes and proteins, it's possible to build up a reasonably accurate picture of how well the liver is functioning. If the test results show you have high levels of bilirubin in your blood, but your liver is otherwise working normally, a confident diagnosis of Gilbert\u2019s syndrome can usually be made. In certain cases, a genetic test may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome. Living with Gilbert's syndrome Gilbert\u2019s syndrome is a lifelong disorder. However, it doesn't require treatment because it doesn't pose a threat to health and doesn't cause complications or an increased risk of liver disease. Episodes of jaundice and any associated symptoms are usually short-lived and eventually pass. If you have Gilbert's syndrome, there's no reason to modify your diet or the amount of exercise you do, and the recommendations about eating a healthy, balanced diet and the physical activity guidelines still apply. However, you may find it useful to avoid the things you know trigger episodes of jaundice, such as dehydration and stress. If you have Gilbert's syndrome, the problem with your liver may also mean you're at risk of developing jaundice or other side effects after taking certain medications. Therefore, seek medical advice before taking any new medication and make sure you mention to any doctors treating you for the first time that you have the syndrome. Medications that shouldn't be taken if you have Gilbert's syndrome, unless advised by a doctor, include some types of HIV medication, some types of medication for high cholesterol, and some chemotherapy medications.

Most adults in the UK have gum disease to some degree and most people experience it at least once. It's much less common in children. If you have gum disease, your gums may bleed when you brush your teeth and you may have bad breath. This early stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis. If gingivitis isn't treated, a condition called periodontitis can develop. This affects more tissues that support teeth and hold them in place. If periodontitis isn't treated, the bone in your jaw may be damaged and small spaces can open up between the gum and teeth. Your teeth can become loose and may eventually fall out. Read more about the symptoms of gum disease. What causes gum disease? Gum disease is caused by a build-up of plaque on the teeth. Plaque is a sticky substance that contains bacteria. Some bacteria in plaque are harmless, but some are harmful for the health of your gums. If you don't remove plaque from your teeth by brushing them, it builds up and irritates your gums. This can lead to redness with bleeding, swelling and soreness. Read more about the causes of gum disease. Seeing your dentist You should make an appointment to see your dentist if your gums are painful, swollen or if they bleed when you brush your teeth. Find a dentist near you. Your dentist can carry out a thorough dental examination to check the health of your gums, which may involve inserting a thin metal stick with a bend in one end (periodontal probe) beside your teeth. In some cases, a number of X-rays may be needed to check the condition of your teeth and jaw bone. Preventing and treating gum disease Mild cases of gum disease can usually be treated by maintaining a good level of oral hygiene. This includes brushing your teeth at least twice a day and flossing regularly. You should also make sure you attend regular dental check-ups. In most cases, your dentist or dental hygienist will be able to give your teeth a thorough clean and remove any hardened plaque (tartar). They'll also be able to show you how to clean your teeth effectively to help prevent plaque building up in the future. If you have severe gum disease, you'll usually need to have further medical and dental treatment and, in some cases, surgery may need to be carried out. This will usually be performed by a specialist in gum problems (periodontics). Read more about treating gum disease and keeping your teeth clean. Dental check-ups It's important to have regular dental check-ups so any problems with your teeth and gums can be detected and treated early. If you've never had gum disease and have good oral health, you may only need to visit your dentist every one to two years for a check-up. You may need to visit your dentist more frequently if you've had problems with gum disease in the past. At each appointment your dentist will advise when you need your next appointment. If you have an increased risk of developing gum problems \u2013 for example, if you smoke or have diabetes \u2013 you may be advised to visit your dentist more often so your teeth and gums can be closely monitored. Complications of gum disease If you have untreated gum disease that develops into periodontitis, it can lead to further complications, such as: gum abscesses (painful collections of pus) receding gums loose teeth loss of teeth Read more about the complications of gum disease.

It is also known as infectious mononucleosis, or \"mono\". Common symptoms include: a high temperature (fever) a severely sore throat swollen glands in the neck fatigue (extreme tiredness) While the symptoms of glandular fever can be very unpleasant, most of them should pass within two to three weeks. Fatigue, however, can occasionally last several months. Read more about the symptoms of glandular fever. When to seek medical advice You should contact your GP if you suspect that you or your child has glandular fever. While there is little your GP can do in terms of treatment, they can provide advice and support to help you control your symptoms and reduce the risk of passing the infection on to others. You should go to your local accident and emergency (A&E) department or dial 999 for an ambulance if you have glandular fever and you: develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties find swallowing fluids difficult develop intense abdominal pain These symptoms can be a sign of a complication of glandular fever that may need to be treated in hospital. What causes glandular fever? Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is found in the saliva of infected people and can be spread through: kissing \u2013 glandular fever is often referred to as the \"kissing disease\" exposure to coughs and sneezes sharing eating and drinking utensils, such as cups, glasses and unwashed cutlery EBV may be found in the saliva of someone who has had glandular fever for several months after their symptoms pass, and some people may continue to have the virus in their saliva on and off for years. If you have EBV, it's a good idea to take steps to avoid infecting others while you are ill, such as not kissing other people, but there's no need no need to avoid all contact with others as the chances of passing on the infection are generally low. Read more about the causes of glandular fever. Who is affected? Glandular fever can affect people of all ages, but most cases affect teenagers and young adults. Most EBV infections are thought to occur during childhood and cause only mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all. However, if a person develops an EBV infection during early adulthood, they can develop glandular fever. Once you have had glandular fever, it is unlikely you will develop it again. This is because people develop lifelong immunity after the initial infection. How glandular fever is diagnosed To diagnose glandular fever, your GP will first ask about your symptoms before carrying out a physical examination. They will look for characteristic signs of glandular fever, such as swollen glands, tonsils, liver and spleen. Your GP may also recommend a blood test to help confirm the diagnosis and rule out infections that can cause similar symptoms, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella, mumps and toxoplasmosis. How glandular fever is treated There is no cure for glandular fever, but there are a number of simple treatments and measures that can help reduce the symptoms while you wait for your body to control the infection. These include: drinking plenty of fluids taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen getting plenty of rest and gradually increasing your activity as your energy levels improve Occasionally, antibiotics or corticosteroids may be used if you develop complications of glandular fever. Some people with particularly severe symptoms may need to be looked after in hospital for a few days. Read more about treating glandular fever. Possible complications Complications associated with glandular fever are uncommon, but when they do occur they can be serious. They can include: further infections of other areas of the body, including the brain, liver and lungs severe anaemia (a lack of oxygen-carrying red blood cells) breathing difficulties as a result of the tonsils becoming significantly swollen a ruptured (burst) spleen, which may need to be treated with surgery Read more about the complications of glandular fever.

Glaucoma often affects both eyes, usually to varying degrees. One eye may develop glaucoma quicker than the other. The eyeball contains a fluid called aqueous humour which is constantly produced by the eye, with any excess drained though tubes. Glaucoma develops when the fluid cannot drain properly and pressure builds up, known as the intraocular pressure. This can damage the optic nerve (which connects the eye to the brain) and the nerve fibres from the retina (the light-sensitive nerve tissue that lines the back of the eye). Read more information about the causes of glaucoma. Types of glaucoma There are four main types of glaucoma: chronic open-angle glaucoma \u2013 this is the most common type of glaucoma and develops very slowly primary angle-closure glaucoma \u2013 this is rare and can occur slowly (chronic) or may develop rapidly (acute) with a sudden, painful build-up of pressure in the eye secondary glaucoma \u2013 this mainly occurs as a result of an eye injury or another eye condition, such as uveitis (inflammation of the middle layer of the eye) developmental glaucoma (congenital glaucoma) \u2013 a rare but sometimes serious type of glaucoma which occurs in very young children, caused by an abnormality of the eye Read more information about the symptoms of glaucoma. Treating glaucoma Glaucoma can be treated with eye drops, laser treatment or surgery. But early diagnosis is important because any damage to the eyes cannot be reversed. Treatment aims to control the condition and minimise future damage. If left untreated, glaucoma can cause visual impairment. But if it's diagnosed and treated early enough, further damage to vision can be prevented. Read more about how glaucoma is treated. Preventing glaucoma Attending regular optician appointments will help to ensure any signs of glaucoma can be detected early and allow treatment to begin. Read about how glaucoma is diagnosed. You are entitled to a free NHS eye test if you are over 40 years old and have a first-degree relative (mother, father, sister or brother) with glaucoma. You may also be entitled to a free NHS eye test if: an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) thinks you are at risk of developing glaucoma you are over 60 years old Read more information about NHS eye care services. How common is glaucoma? In England and Wales, it's estimated more than 500,000 people have glaucoma but many more people may not know they have the condition. Chronic open-angle glaucoma affects up to two in every 100 people over 40 years old and around five in every 100 people over 80 years old. You are also at increased risk of developing open-angle glaucoma if you are of black-African or black-Caribbean origin. Some types of glaucoma, such as acute angle-closure glaucoma, are much less common. However, people of Asian origin are more at risk of getting this type of glaucoma compared with those from other ethnic groups. Glaucoma Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

It's often caused by your immune system attacking healthy body tissue. In most cases, glomerulonephritis doesn't cause any noticeable symptoms and is often diagnosed when blood or urine tests are carried out for another reason. In severe cases, glomerulonephritis may cause visible blood in your urine or your urine may become frothy. Swelling of the legs or other parts of the body (oedema) can also develop. Having blood in your urine doesn't mean that you definitely have glomerulonephritis, but you should see your GP so the cause can be investigated. Read more about the symptoms of glomerulonephritis and diagnosing glomerulonephritis. Why does glomerulonephritis happen? Glomerulonephritis is usually the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack healthy tissue in the kidneys. However, there are many cases where the exact cause is unknown. It can occur by itself or be part of a more general condition, such as vasculitis or lupus. Glomerulonephritis is sometimes short-lived (acute), but often lasts for a long time (chronic). Read more about the causes of glomerulonephritis.  How is glomerulonephritis treated? The recommended treatment will depend on the cause and severity of your condition. Mild cases may not need any treatment. Treatment can be as simple as making changes to your diet, such as eating less salt to reduce the strain on your kidneys. Medications to lower blood pressure, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, are commonly prescribed for glomerulonephritis because they help protect the kidneys. If the condition is caused by a problem with your immune system, medications called immunosuppressants may be used. Although treatment is effective in many cases, further problems can sometimes develop. These include high blood pressure, damage to other organs, chronic kidney disease and kidney failure. Read more about treating glomerulonephritis and the complications of glomerulonephritis. Information about you If you have glomerulonephritis, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. What do our kidneys do?

The medical term for glue ear is otitis media with effusion (OME). It's estimated that one in five children around the age of two will be affected by glue ear at any given time, and about 8 in every 10 children will have had glue ear at least once by the time they're 10 years old. The main symptom of glue ear is some hearing loss in one or both ears. This is usually similar to what you experience when you put your hands over your ears. Signs that your child may be having problems hearing include:  struggling to keep up with conversations becoming aggravated because they're trying harder to hear regularly turning up the volume on the television  Contact your GP if you have any concerns about your child's hearing. Read more about the symptoms of glue ear and diagnosing glue ear. What causes glue ear? The middle ear is the part of the ear directly behind the eardrum. It contains three tiny bones that carry sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. The build-up of fluid associated with glue ear prevents these bones moving freely, which affects hearing because it means they can't pass sound vibrations to the inner ear. Exactly what causes this build-up of fluid is unclear, although it seems to be related to a problem with the tube that connects the middle ear to the back of the throat (Eustachian tube). One of the main functions of the Eustachian tube is to help drain fluid from the middle ear. It's thought that problems with the Eustachian tube may be caused by things like a previous ear infection, smoke irritation or allergies. Glue ear isn't caused by a build-up of ear wax, or by getting water in the ear after swimming or showering. Other factors that are also thought to increase the risk of getting glue ear include: growing up in a household where adults smoke being bottlefed rather than breastfed as a baby having siblings (brothers and sisters) who've had the condition Read more about the causes of glue ear and preventing glue ear. Treating glue ear Most cases of glue ear don't require treatment as the condition will improve by itself, usually within three months. Treatment is usually only recommended when symptoms last longer than three months and the hearing loss is thought to be significant enough to interfere with a child's speech and language development. In these circumstances, glue ear can usually be treated using minor surgery, which involves placing small tubes (grommets) in the ear to help drain away the fluid. Read more about treating glue ear. Complications of glue ear Possible complications of glue ear include ear infections and, where hearing loss is more severe, a minor temporary delay in speech and language development. Some of the problems associated with glue ear get better by themselves quite quickly, although further treatment may occasionally be necessary. Read more about the complications of glue ear. Adults with glue ear Glue ear can occasionally develop in adults. It's diagnosed and treated in much the same way as children. If symptoms show no signs of improving after about three months, grommets can be put inside the ear to drain the fluid from it.

It can be worrying, but it's usually only caused by a minor infection and will often get better in a few days without treatment. Earache can be a sharp, dull or burning ear pain that comes and goes or is constant. One or both ears may be affected. When to contact your GP It's not always necessary to see your GP if you or your child have earache. The pain will often improve in a few days and there are things you can do to help in the meantime. You should contact your GP or local out-of-hours service if:  you or your child also have other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever), vomiting, a severe sore throat, swelling around the ear, or discharge from the ear there is something stuck in your or your child's ear the earache doesn't improve within a few days What you can do at home You can use over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat the pain. Children under the age of 16 should not take aspirin. Placing a warm flannel against the affected ear may also help relieve the pain. Your pharmacist may be able to recommend over-the-counter eardrops for your earache, but let them know your symptoms and ask for their advice first. Eardrops or olive oil drops should not be used if the eardrum has burst, and they will not help an ear infection. If you or your child has an ear infection, you should avoid getting the affected ear wet. Common causes of earache The information below should not be used to self-diagnose your condition, but it may give you an idea as to what might be causing your earache. It does not include every possible cause, but outlines some of the most common reasons for earache. Ear infections If the cause of earache is an ear infection, there may be a watery or pus-like fluid coming out of the ear. Outer ear infections (infections of the tube connecting the outer ear and eardrum) and middle ear infections (infections of the parts of the ear behind the eardrum) are very common causes of earache. Many ear infections clear up on their own without treatment in a few days or weeks, but in some cases your GP may prescribe eardrops or antibiotics. Read more about treating outer ear infections and treating middle ear infections. Glue ear Glue ear (also known as otitis media with effusion, or OME) is a build-up of fluid deep inside the ear, which commonly causes some temporary hearing loss. The condition tends to be painless, but sometimes the pressure of this fluid can cause earache. Glue ear will often clear up on its own, although this can take a few months. If the problem is particularly persistent, a minor procedure to place small tubes called grommets in the ear may be recommended to help drain the fluid. Read more about treating glue ear. Damage to the ear Earache can sometimes result from injury to the inside of the ear \u2013 for example, by scraping earwax from the ear canal using a cotton bud, or poking a cotton bud too far into your ear, which can puncture the eardrum. The ear canal is very sensitive and can easily become damaged. The ear should heal on its own without treatment, but it can take up to two months for a perforated eardrum to heal. If you have a perforated eardrum, eardrops shouldn't be used. Earwax or an object in the ear A build-up of earwax or an object stuck inside the ear can sometimes cause earache. If there is something in your or your child's ear that seems be causing pain, don't attempt to remove it yourself, as you may only push it further inside and you may damage the eardrum. If you have a build-up of earwax in your ear, your pharmacist will be able to recommend eardrops to soften it so it falls out naturally. In some cases, your GP will need to remove the wax (once softened with eardrops) by flushing the ear with water. This is known as ear irrigation. If there is an object in the ear, your GP may need to refer you or your child to a specialist to have it removed. Throat infections If you find it painful to swallow and you have a sore throat, your earache could be a symptom of a throat infection, such as tonsillitis or quinsy (an abscess on one side of the back of your throat, which can sometimes make it very difficult to swallow even fluids). Some types of tonsillitis will clear up after a few days without the need for antibiotics. But if you have quinsy, you will need to see your GP as soon as possible for treatment. You may have quinsy if your sore throat gets worse very quickly. A problem with your jaw Earache is occasionally caused by a problem with the joint of your jaw bone (where the jaw meets the skull). This is known as temporomandibular joint pain and can be caused by problems such as arthritis or teeth grinding. Jaw pain can often be treated with painkillers, warm or cold compresses, and trying not to clench your jaw and grind your teeth. A dental abscess A dental abscess is a collection of pus that can form in your teeth or gums as a result of a bacterial infection. The main symptom is pain in your affected tooth, which can be intense and throbbing, although the pain can sometimes spread to your ear. If you think you may have a dental abscess, make a dentist appointment as soon as possible. They may need to remove the abscess and drain the pus. Read more about treating dental abscesses.

It means the body can\u2019t process certain amino acids (\"building blocks\" of protein), causing a harmful build-up of substances in the blood and urine. Normally, our bodies break down protein foods like meat and fish into amino acids. Any amino acids that aren't needed are usually broken down and removed from the body. Babies with GA1 are unable to break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan. Normally, these amino acids are broken down into a substance called glutaric acid, which is then converted into energy. Babies with GA1 don\u2019t have the enzyme that breaks down glutaric acid, leading to a harmfully high level of this and other substances in the body. Diagnosing GA1 At around five days old, babies are now offered newborn blood spot screening to check if they have GA1. This involves pricking your baby\u2019s heel to collect drops of blood to test. If GA1 is diagnosed, treatment can be given straight away to reduce the risk of serious complications. With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, the majority of children with GA1 are able to live normal, healthy lives. However, treatment for GA1 must be continued for life. Without treatment, severe and life-threatening symptoms can develop, including seizures (fits) or falling into a coma. Some children with untreated GA1 are also at risk of brain damage, which can affect muscle movement. This may lead to problems with walking, talking and swallowing. Around 1 in 100,000 children worldwide are thought to be affected by GA1. Symptoms of GA1 Symptoms of GA1 usually don\u2019t appear until a few months after birth, although some babies are born with a larger-than-average head (macrocephaly). Children with GA1 may develop some floppiness or weakness in their muscles (hypotonia) during their first year and there\u2019s a risk of developing bleeding around their brain (subdural haematoma). In rarer cases, bleeding can develop around the back of the eyes (retinal haemorrhage). Metabolic crisis Children with GA1 may have episodes known as a metabolic crisis, sometimes early in their life. Symptoms of a metabolic crisis include: poor feeding or loss of appetite lack of energy abnormal movements vomiting irritability breathing difficulties It\u2019s important to get medical help immediately if your baby develops symptoms of a metabolic crisis. Your doctor will give you advice to help recognise the signs. In some cases, a metabolic crisis may be triggered later in childhood by an infection or illness. The hospital should provide you with emergency treatment instructions to follow if your child is ill, which helps to prevent these symptoms developing. Treating GA1 Diet Children diagnosed with GA1 are referred to a specialist metabolic dietitian and given a low-protein diet. This is tailored to reduce the amount of amino acids your baby receives, especially lysine and tryptophan. High-protein foods need to be limited, including: meat fish cheese eggs pulses nuts Your dietitian will provide detailed advice and guidance, as your baby still needs some of these foods for healthy growth and development. Breastfeeding and baby milk also need to be monitored and measured, as advised by your dietitian. Regular baby milk contains the amino acids that need to be restricted, so a special formula is used instead. This contains all the vitamins, minerals and other amino acids your baby needs. People with GA1 may need to follow a restricted protein diet for the rest of their life to reduce their risk of a metabolic crisis. As your child gets older, they\u2019ll need to learn how to control their diet and stay in contact with a dietitian for advice and monitoring. Medication Your child will be prescribed a medication called L-carnitine, which helps to clear some of the excess glutaric acid. L-carnitine is given as a tablet and needs to be taken regularly, as directed by your doctor. Emergency treatment If your baby develops an infection, such as a high temperature or cold, their risk of having a metabolic crisis increases. It\u2019s possible to reduce the risk by changing to an emergency diet while they\u2019re ill. Your dietitian will provide detailed instructions, but the aim is to replace milk and food containing protein with special high-sugar drinks. Medication should still be taken as normal. Your dietitian may provide you with a feeding tube (nasogastric tube) and show you how to use it safely. This can be useful in an emergency if your baby isn\u2019t feeding well while they are ill. If your baby can\u2019t keep down their emergency feeds, or develops repeated diarrhoea, you should contact the metabolic team at the hospital to let them know you\u2019re heading straight to the accident and emergency (A&E) department. You should also have been provided with a leaflet to bring with you in case of an emergency, in case the doctors haven\u2019t seen GA1 before. Once in hospital, your baby can be monitored and treated with intravenous fluids (given directly into a vein). You should also take your baby to hospital if they develop symptoms of a metabolic crisis, such as irritability, loss of energy or breathing difficulties. How GA1 is inherited The genetic cause (mutation) of GA1 is passed on by the parents, who usually don\u2019t have any symptoms of the condition. The way this mutation is passed on is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. This means a baby needs to receive two copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition \u2013 one from their mother and one from their father. If the baby only receives one mutated gene, they\u2019ll just be a carrier of GA1. If you\u2019re a carrier of the affected gene and you have a baby with a partner who\u2019s also a carrier, your baby has: a 25% chance of developing the condition a 50% chance of being a carrier of GA1 a 25% chance of receiving a pair of normal genes Although it\u2019s not possible to prevent GA1, it\u2019s important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition. Any further children you have can be tested for the condition as soon as possible and given appropriate treatment. You may also wish to consider genetic counselling for support, information and advice about genetic conditions. Information about you If you or your child has GA1, your clinical team will pass information about you\/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Eating foods containing gluten can trigger a range of symptoms, such as: diarrhoea, which may smell particularly unpleasant bloating and flatulence (passing wind) abdominal pain weight loss feeling tired all the time as a result of  malnutrition (not getting enough nutrients from food) children not growing at the expected rate Symptoms can range from mild to severe. Read more about the symptoms of coeliac disease. What causes coeliac disease? Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition. This is where the immune system \u2013 the body's defence against infection \u2013 mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. Coeliac disease isn't an allergy or an intolerance to gluten. In cases of coeliac disease, the immune system mistakes substances found inside gluten as a threat to the body and attacks them. This damages the surface of the small bowel (intestines), disrupting the body's ability to absorb nutrients from food. Exactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is still not entirely clear, although a combination of a person's genetic make-up and the environment appear to play a part. Read more about the causes of coeliac disease. Gluten Gluten is a protein found in three types of cereal: wheat barley rye Gluten is found in any food that contains the above cereals, including: pasta cakes breakfast cereals most types of bread certain types of sauces some types of ready meals In addition, most beers are made from barley. Treating coeliac disease There is no cure for coeliac disease, but switching to a gluten-free diet should help control symptoms and prevent the long-term consequences of the disease. Even if symptoms are mild or non-existent, it is still recommended to change your diet, as continuing to eat gluten can lead to serious complications. It is important to make sure your gluten-free diet is healthy and balanced. An increase in the range of available gluten-free foods in recent years has made it possible to eat both a healthy and varied gluten-free diet. Read more about the treatment of coeliac disease. Screening Currently, screening for coeliac disease is not routinely carried out in England. It is usually only recommended for people at an increased risk of developing the condition, such as those with a family history of the disease.  It is recommended that first-degree relatives (parents, brothers, sisters and children) of people with coeliac disease are screened. See diagnosing coeliac disease for more information about who should be screened for coeliac disease. Complications Complications of coeliac disease only tend to affect people who continue to eat gluten or who have yet to be diagnosed with the condition, which can be a common problem in milder cases. Potential long-term complications include: osteoporosis (weakening of the bones) iron deficiency anaemia vitamin B12 and folate deficiency anaemia  Less common and more serious complications include those affecting pregnancy, such as having a low-birth weight baby, and some types of cancers, such as bowel cancer. Read more about the complications of coeliac disease. Who is affected? Coeliac disease is a common condition that affects approximately 1 in every 100 people in the UK. However, some experts think this may be an underestimate because milder cases may go undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed as other digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Reported cases of coeliac disease are two to three times higher in women than men and can develop at any age, although symptoms are most likely to develop: during early childhood \u2013 at between 8 and 12 months old (though it may take several years before a correct diagnosis is made)  in later adulthood \u2013 between the ages of 40 and 60 years Information about you If you have coeliac disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley and rye  Coeliac UK The UK's leading charity for people affected by coeliac disease is Coeliac UK. Their website contains a range of useful resources, including information on gluten-free diets and specific products, as well as the details of local groups, volunteering and ongoing campaigns. The charity also has a telephone helpline on 0845 305 2060, open Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm.

It is estimated that around 1 in 12 children under the age of three have a food allergy. What is a food allergy? A food allergy is a rapid and potentially serious response to a food by your immune system. It can trigger classic allergy symptoms such as a rash, wheezing and itching. In rare cases the symptoms can be very severe and can cause potentially fatal breathing difficulties. This type of severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis should be treated as a medical emergency. Causes of food allergies The most common food allergies among adults are to fish and shellfish and nuts, including peanuts, walnuts, hazelnuts and brazil nuts. Children often have allergies to milk and eggs as well as to peanuts, other nuts and fish.  What is a food intolerance? Food intolerances are more common than food allergies. In a recent UK survey around one in five adults reported having a food intolerance. The symptoms of food intolerance tend to come on more slowly, often many hours after eating the problem food. Typical symptoms include bloating and stomach cramps. It's possible to be intolerant to several different foods. This can make it difficult to identify which foods are causing the problem. It is often unclear why a person has an intolerance to a certain type of food. Food intolerances can also be difficult to tell apart from other digestive disorders that produce similar symptoms, such as inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal obstructions or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). If you do have IBS you mind find that certain types of food, such as fried or fatty food, can trigger the onset of symptoms. Lactose intolerance Lactose intolerance, sometimes known as dairy intolerance, occurs when your body can't digest lactose. Lactose is in milk and dairy products such as yoghurts and soft cheeses. The main symptoms of lactose intolerance are diarrhoea and stomach pain. In most cases, your GP can diagnose lactose intolerance by looking at your symptoms and medical history. Could it be another type of food intolerance or condition? Sometimes it isn't clear which food is causing a problem. The only reliable way of identifying such a food intolerance is through an exclusion diet, where you cut out certain foods from your diet one at a time to see if there's an effect. Coeliac disease is a digestive condition where a person has an adverse reaction to gluten. However, coeliac disease is not an allergy or an intolerance to gluten. It is an autoimmune condition where the immune system mistakes substances found inside gluten as a threat to the body and attacks them. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye and barley that damages the intestine of people with coeliac disease. Symptoms include diarrhoea, bloating and weight loss. Coeliac disease can be accurately diagnosed with a blood test and biopsy. About 1 in 100 people in the UK have coeliac disease, but it's estimated that around half a million aren't diagnosed. Treatments for food allergy and food intolerance Always read food labels carefully, and learn where your problem food may be used as an ingredient in other foods. If you have a food allergy, you'll have to avoid the food you're allergic to. You may be able to eat the cooked versions without any problems, as can be the case with fruit or vegetable allergies. With lactose intolerance, you'll have to reduce the amount of dairy food that you eat. With other forms of food intolerance, you'll have to stop eating the food for a while, or possibly for life. With the autoimmune condition coeliac disease, you must avoid gluten for life. For more advice on your diet, ask your GP to refer you to an NHS dietitian.

But occasionally they can become infected, cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or spread serious illnesses such as Lyme disease and malaria. Bugs that bite or sting include wasps, hornets, bees, horseflies, ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, spiders and midges. This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you've been bitten or stung When to get medical advice When to get emergency medical help Prevention Symptoms of insect bites and stings Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Some people have a mild allergic reaction and a larger area of skin around the bite or sting becomes swollen, red and painful. This should pass within a week. Occasionally, a severe allergic reaction can occur, causing symptoms such as breathing difficulties, dizziness and a swollen face or mouth. This requires immediate medical treatment (see below). Read more about the symptoms of common insect bites and stings. What to do if you've been bitten or stung To treat an insect bite or sting: Remove the sting or tick if it's still in the skin (see treating insect bites and stings for advice about how to do this safely). Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they're unlikely to help. The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. Ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments that can help, such as painkillers, creams for itching and antihistamines. Read more about treatments for insect bites and stings. When to get medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if: you're worried about a bite or sting your symptoms don't start to improve within a few days or are getting worse you've been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes a large area (around 10cm or more) around the bite becomes red and swollen you have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness you have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a fever, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms When to get emergency medical help Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe reaction, such as: wheezing or difficulty breathing a swollen face, mouth or throat nausea or vomiting a fast heart rate dizziness or feeling faint difficulty swallowing loss of consciousness Emergency treatment in hospital is needed in these cases. Prevent insect bites and stings There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin \u2013 repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants \u2013 these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. You may need to take extra precautions if you're travelling to part of the world where there's a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about how to prevent insect bites and stings.

The lump will move up and down when you swallow. The thyroid gland is a small butterfly-shaped gland in the neck, just in front of the windpipe (trachea). It produces thyroid hormones, which help regulate the body's metabolism, the chemical processes that occur in the body. The size of a goitre can vary from person to person. In most cases, the swelling is small and doesn't cause any symptoms. In more severe cases, the symptoms may include: coughing a tight feeling in your throat changes to your voice, such as hoarsenes difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) difficulty breathing \u2013 there may be a high-pitched sound when you breathe (stridor) Diagnosing a goitre If you think you have a goitre, see your GP. They'll examine your neck to see whether your thyroid gland is swollen, and may request a thyroid function test to see how well your thyroid gland is working. A thyroid function test measures the level of certain hormones (chemicals produced by the body) in your blood. It can show whether you have an underactive or overactive thyroid, both of which are associated with goitre. If necessary, you may be referred to a specialist in hospital for further tests or treatment. Read more about how a goitre is diagnosed. Treating a goitre The treatment for a goitre depends on the underlying cause. If the goitre is small and isn't causing any problems, a wait-and-see approach is usually recommended. Other possible treatments include radioiodine treatment and thyroid surgery. Although most goitres are usually non-cancerous (benign), it's estimated that in 1 in 20 cases they may be a sign of thyroid cancer. Read more about treating a goitre. Causes of a goitre A goitre can have several possible causes, including: an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) hormone changes during puberty, pregnancy or the menopause not enough iodine (a trace mineral found in fish and plant foods) in your diet taking some types of medication \u2013 such as lithium, a medication often used to treat a number of mental health conditions an inflamed thyroid gland (thyroiditis) having radiation treatment to your neck or chest area \u2013 such as radiotherapy for neck cancer nodules or cysts within the thyroid \u2013 most are benign, but should be assessed thyroid cancer \u2013 a rare type of cancer in the UK Anyone can develop a goitre, but the chances increase with age. Women are also more likely to develop a goitre. Types of goitre There are two main types of goitre: diffuse goitre \u2013 where the entire thyroid gland swells and feels smooth to the touch nodular goitre \u2013 where solid or fluid-filled lumps called nodules develop within the thyroid and make the thyroid gland feel lumpy to touch; the nodules can be single or multiple and may contain fluid (cysts) Page last reviewed: 12\/05\/2016 Next review due: 12\/05\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

A girl with Turner syndrome only has one normal X sex chromosome, rather than the usual two (XX). This chromosome variation happens randomly when the baby is conceived in the womb. It is not linked to the mother's age. Read more about the genetic cause of Turner syndrome.  Characteristics of Turner syndrome Females with Turner syndrome often have a wide range of symptoms and some distinctive characteristics. Almost all girls with Turner syndrome: are shorter than average have underdeveloped ovaries (female reproductive organs), resulting in a lack of monthly periods and infertility As height and sexual development are the two main characteristics, Turner syndrome may not be diagnosed until a girl fails to show sexual development associated with puberty, usually between the ages of 8 and 14 years. Other characteristics of Turner syndrome can vary significantly between individuals. Read more about the symptoms of Turner syndrome and how Turner syndrome is diagnosed. Treating Turner syndrome There is no cure for Turner syndrome, but many of the associated symptoms can be treated. Girls and women with Turner syndrome will need to have regular health checks of their heart, kidneys and reproductive system throughout their lives. However, it is usually possible to lead a relatively normal and healthy life. Life expectancy is slightly reduced, but it can be improved with regular health checks to identify and treat potential problems at an early stage. Read more about treating Turner syndrome. Information about you If you or your daughter has Turner syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you\/your daughter on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

It used to be known as 'the clap'. The bacteria are mainly found in discharge from the penis and in vaginal fluid. Gonorrhoea is easily passed between people through: unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex sharing vibrators or other sex toys that haven't been washed or covered with a new condom each time they're used The bacteria can infect the cervix (entrance to the womb), the urethra (tube through which urine passes out of the body), the rectum, and less commonly the throat or eyes. The infection can also be passed from a pregnant woman to her baby. If you're pregnant and may have gonorrhoea, it's important to get tested and treated before your baby is born. Without treatment, gonorrhoea can cause permanent blindness in a newborn baby. Gonorrhoea isn't spread by kissing, hugging, sharing baths or towels, swimming pools, toilet seats, or sharing cups, plates and cutlery, because the bacteria can't survive outside the human body for long. Signs and symptoms Typical symptoms of gonorrhoea include a thick green or yellow discharge from the vagina or penis, pain when urinating and (in women) bleeding between periods. However, around 1 in 10 infected men and almost half of infected women don't experience any symptoms. Read more about the symptoms of gonorrhoea. Getting tested If you have any of the symptoms of gonorrhoea, or you're worried you may have an STI, you should visit your local genitourinary medicine (GUM) or sexual health clinic for a sexual health test. Gonorrhoea can be easily diagnosed by testing a sample of discharge picked up using a swab. Testing a sample of urine can also be used to diagnose the condition in men. It's important to get tested as soon as possible, because gonorrhoea can lead to more serious long-term health problems if it's not treated, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women, or infertility. You can find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching by postcode or town. For information on all sexual health services, visit the FPA website. Read more about diagnosing gonorrhoea and the possible complications of gonorrhoea. Treating gonorrhoea Gonorrhoea is usually treated with a single antibiotic injection and a single antibiotic tablet. With effective treatment, most of your symptoms should improve within a few days. It's usually recommended that you attend a follow-up appointment a week or two after treatment, so another test can be carried out to see if you're clear of infection. You should avoid having sex until you've been given the all-clear. Read more about how gonorrhoea is treated. Who's affected? Anyone who's sexually active can catch gonorrhoea, especially people who change partners frequently or don't use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, when having sex. Gonorrhoea is the second most common bacterial STI in the UK after chlamydia. Almost 35,000 cases were reported in England during 2014, with most cases affecting young men and women under the age of 25. Previous successful treatment for gonorrhoea doesn't make you immune to catching the infection again. Preventing gonorrhoea Gonorrhoea and other STIs can be successfully prevented by using appropriate contraception and taking other precautions, such as: using male condoms or female condoms every time you have vaginal sex, or male condoms during anal sex using a condom to cover the penis, or a latex or plastic square (dam) to cover the female genitals, if you have oral sex not sharing sex toys, or washing them and covering them with a new condom before anyone else uses them If you're worried you may have an STI, visit your local GUM or sexual health clinic for advice.

It causes sudden attacks of severe pain and swelling. It's estimated that between one and two in every 100 people in the UK are affected by gout. The condition mainly affects men over 30 and women after the menopause. Overall, gout is more common in men than women. Gout can be extremely painful and debilitating, but treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms and prevent further attacks. Signs and symptoms of gout Any joint can be affected by gout, but it usually affects joints towards the ends of the limbs, such as the toes, ankles, knees and fingers. Signs and symptoms of gout include: severe pain in one or more joints the joint feeling hot and very tender swelling in and around the affected joint red, shiny skin over the affected joint   Symptoms develop rapidly over a few hours and typically last three to 10 days. After this time the pain should pass and the joint should return to normal. Almost everyone with gout will experience further attacks at some point, usually within a year. Read more about the symptoms of gout. When to see your GP See your GP if you suspect you have gout and it hasn't been previously diagnosed, particularly if the pain keeps getting worse and you also have a high temperature (fever). It's important that a diagnosis is confirmed because other conditions that require urgent treatment, such as an infected joint, can sometimes cause similar symptoms. If you've already been diagnosed with gout and you have an attack, see your GP if any medication you've been prescribed (see below) doesn't start working within a couple of days. Read more about diagnosing gout. What causes gout? Gout is caused by a build-up of a substance called uric acid in the blood. If you produce too much uric acid or your kidneys don't filter enough out, it can build up and cause tiny sharp crystals to form in and around joints. These crystals can cause the joint to become inflamed (red and swollen) and painful. Things that may increase your chances of getting gout include: obesity, high blood pressure and\/or diabetes having a close relative with gout kidney problems eating foods that cause a build-up of uric acid, such as red meat, offal and seafood drinking too much beer or spirits Read more about the causes of gout. Treatments for gout If you have gout, treatment is available from your GP to: relieve symptoms during an attack \u2013 this can be done using ice packs and by taking medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine or corticosteroids prevent further attacks \u2013 through a combination of lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or changing your diet, and taking medication that lowers uric acid levels, such as allopurinol  With treatment, many people are able to reduce their uric acid levels sufficiently to dissolve the crystals that cause gout \u2013 and as a result have no further attacks. However, lifelong treatment is usually required. Read more about treating gout. Can gout cause further problems? Sometimes gout can lead to further problems, particularly if it's left untreated. These can include: kidney stones small firm lumps of uric acid crystals under the skin called tophi permanent joint damage Read more about the complications of gout. What's pseudogout? Pseudogout is a similar condition to gout, but usually affects the knee joint first. It's a form of arthritis that causes pain, stiffness, tenderness, redness, warmth and swelling in one or more of your joints - commonly the knee or wrist.  Page last reviewed: 24\/09\/2015 Next review due: 24\/09\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The rash usually appears over the backs of your forearms, hands or feet. It tends to affect children and young adults, and is slightly more common in females. What causes granuloma annulare? In granuloma annulare, the dermis (the tissue underneath the top layer of skin, which is known as the epidermis) becomes hypersensitive and inflamed. It's not clear what causes the skin to react in this way. The condition is sometimes associated with diabetes. The rash The rash is usually the only symptom of granuloma annulare, and most people with it are otherwise healthy. It may be slightly itchy, but it isn't usually painful. There may be a number of rings that grow slowly until they're about 2.5-5cm (1-2 inches) across. They then become flatter and more purple in colour, before eventually fading. In rare cases, the rash may spread all over the body, or there may be one or more firm lumps under the skin of the arms or legs (this is known as subcutaneous granuloma annulare). Granuloma annulare usually disappears without treatment within two years, although it can sometimes last for many years and new rings may appear. It's not infectious or caused by allergies. What to do Contact your GP if you notice a ring anywhere on your skin that doesn't go away within a few weeks. They'll be able to rule out other possible causes, like a fungal infection. Because granuloma annulare is harmless, you may not need any treatment for it. However, you may wish to consider treatment if the appearance of the rash is upsetting you. How it's treated There's no specific treatment for granuloma annulare and evidence for the use of medication is limited. Strong steroid creams or ointments, or steroid injections directly into the rings, may help to clear up the rash. However, steroids must be used carefully, because long-term use can thin the skin. Read more about corticosteroids (steroid medication). Severe or widespread cases of granuloma annulare can be treated with ultraviolet light therapy (PUVA) or medicines that suppress the immune system, usually imiquimod, tacrolimus or pimecrolimus cream. In some cases, cryotherapy (freezing the bumps with liquid nitrogen) may be recommended as a way of removing them and stimulating new skin growth. However, this type of treatment isn't always effective, and it can be painful and cause permanent scarring.

It's a serious condition that can eventually lead to tissue damage and organ failure and can be fatal if left untreated. However, there are effective treatments which mean most people can live relatively normal lives with the condition. Until recently, GPA used to be called Wegener's granulomatosis. Signs and symptoms The inflammation of the blood vessels (known as vasculitis) caused by GPA mainly affects the nose, sinuses, ears, lungs and kidneys, although other organs can be affected too, including the brain, skin, nerves, heart and bowels. This means the condition can have a wide range of symptoms, such as: a persistent unexplained fever night sweats fatigue (extreme tiredness) and weakness a general ill feeling loss of appetite and weight loss joint pain and soreness persistent ear infections and reduced hearing frequent sinusitis recurrent nosebleeds and crusts around the nose chest pain, cough and shortness of breath coughing up blood or blood in the phlegm blood in the urine Some people with GPA may also be at risk of developing blood clots in their legs (deep vein thrombosis) or lungs (pulmonary embolism). When to seek medical advice If you have any of the above symptoms that are persistent or troublesome see your GP. They can arrange appropriate tests if they suspect GPA is the cause and, if appropriate, arrange referral to a specialist centre for treatment. If you have been diagnosed with GPA and suddenly develop any of the above symptoms, see your GP immediately because you are probably experiencing a relapse (return of the condition). What causes GPA? The exact cause of GPA is unknown. It is thought that GPA is likely to be an autoimmune disease, which means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues. As with other autoimmune disorders, it's probable that people with GPA have a gene that makes them more likely to develop the condition. GPA is then probably triggered by an additional factor, such as an infection with bacteria or a virus. Genes alone are not responsible for the condition, as it's very unusual for GPA to occur in two people in the same family. Who is affected Around 500 men and women are diagnosed with GPA each year in the UK. Symptoms can start at any age, including in childhood, although the condition usually first appears in middle-aged or elderly people. How GPA is diagnosed Your doctor may suspect GPA if you feel unwell, have a persistent fever and have lost weight, and one or more of the following areas of your body is affected: your nose, ears and sinuses \u2013 for example, you have persistent earache, nosebleeds or sinusitis lungs \u2013 for example, you have difficulty breathing or are coughing up blood, or your chest X-ray shows lung abnormalities kidneys \u2013 for example, there is blood or protein in your urine Blood tests may be done to test levels of ANCAs (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies). These are antibodies thought to be involved in the process that leads to the blood vessels becoming inflamed. However, this test can sometimes come back negative in people with GPA and positive in people who don\u2019t have the condition, so it can't be relied upon on its own to diagnose the condition. A tissue sample of the affected area may also be removed (a biopsy) and looked at under the microscope for evidence of inflammation. In GPA, white blood cells clump together to form tiny lumps called granulomas. Computerised tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans may also be carried out to assess the condition of any organs or areas of the body that may be affected. How GPA is treated The aim of treatment for GPA is firstly to bring the condition under control (known as inducing remission), and then try to prevent the condition relapsing (known as maintaining remission). For most people, this can be achieved using a number of different medications, which may need to be taken for a number of years. Medication administration is supervised through specialist centres in close liaison with your GP and is tailored to each individual patient. Inducing remission To begin with, you will usually need high doses of medication to dampen down your immune system and bring the inflammation under control. Typically, you will be given a steroid medication called prednisolone to reduce the inflammation in addition to a medication called cyclophosphamide, which weakens your immune system. Steroid medication is either given intravenously alongside this, or is taken by mouth (orally) on a daily basis. Cyclophosphamide is normally given intravenously (directly into a vein) every two to three weeks. In milder cases, an alternative oral immune-suppressing medication called methotrexate may be given instead of cyclophosphamide. This treatment will continue \u2013 with your steroid dose gradually reduced over time \u2013 until you achieve remission, which in most people takes around three to six months. Cyclophosphamide and steroids are powerful medications, so make sure you discuss the possible side effects with your doctor. Read more about the side effects of steroid medication. Maintaining remission Once remission is achieved, your treatment with cyclophosphamide will be stopped and you will be given a milder immune-suppressing medication such as methotrexate or azathioprine. Your steroid medication may also be stopped, or you may continue taking it at a low dose. This stage of treatment will usually last between two and five years and will also involve frequent check-ups to look for signs of a relapse. Other treatments Although the medications described above are effective for most people, some people with GPA will need alternative or additional treatment. For example, you may be given long-term treatment with antibiotics alongside your other medications to prevent potentially serious infections, as the medications used to treat GPA can increase your chances of picking up an infection. If you have severe GPA, cyclophosphamide is not suitable for you, or your condition relapses despite therapy, you may be offered a medication called rituximab instead. This medication works by destroying certain cells produced by the immune system that are thought to play a role in the inflammation of the blood vessels. In particularly severe cases affecting the kidneys, a procedure called plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) may be recommended.  During this procedure, you will be connected to a machine that removes some of your blood. A blood component called plasma will then be separated from the blood cells and removed, before the remaining blood cells are returned to your body. This process can remove some of the antibodies thought to contribute to the inflammation in GPA. Once the disease is under control, some people may also need surgical treatment. For example, surgery may be needed to correct any nose deformities, narrowing of the airways or obstruction of the tear ducts that can occur as a result of the tissue damage caused by GPA. If damage to the kidneys means they are no longer able to work properly, a kidney transplant may be needed. Outlook Although GPA can be life-threatening, early diagnosis and modern treatments can significantly improve the outlook. Most people are able to achieve remission with medical treatment, although about half of people with GPA will have a relapse at some point. This usually happens within a few years of stopping treatment. If you do have a relapse, you will usually need to start taking medication again or increase the doses of any medication you are already taking. Most people with GPA are able to lead normal lives, although \u2013 in addition to taking medication regularly \u2013 you will need to have regular check-ups to monitor your progress and check for signs of a relapse. Complications, if they occur, are often the result of a delay in diagnosis and a lack of treatment. If left untreated, people with GPA may develop severe inflammation in the respiratory tract and kidneys, which can eventually lead to life-threatening lung and kidney failure. Information about you If you have GPA, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Overproduction of thyroid hormones can be caused by a number of conditions, which are outlined below. Graves' disease Graves' disease is the most common cause of overactive thyroid. It can run in families and can occur at any age, although it is most common in women aged 20-40 years old. You are more likely to develop Graves' disease if you smoke. Graves' disease is an autoimmune condition. This means the immune system mistakes something in the body for a toxic substance and attacks it. In Graves' disease, it attacks the thyroid gland, which leads to an overproduction of the thyroid hormones. It is not known what triggers the immune system to do this. Like many autoimmune conditions, it is thought that a combination of both genetic and environmental factors could be involved. If you have Graves' disease, your eyes may also be affected, causing discomfort and double vision. This is known as Graves' ophthalmopathy. You may find your eyes bulge out or appear more prominent. For more information on Graves' ophthalmopathy, read our page on complications of an overactive thyroid gland. Thyroid nodules It is possible for lumps to develop in your thyroid gland. These are known as nodules. It is not known why nodules develop, but they are usually non-cancerous (benign). However, the nodules can contain abnormal thyroid tissue, which affects the normal production of thyroxine or triiodothyronine, causing an overactive thyroid. Nodules that contain abnormal thyroid tissue are described as toxic. Toxic thyroid nodules account for about 1 in 20 cases of hyperthyroidism. Iodine supplements Iodine contained in the food you eat is used by your thyroid gland to produce the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine. However, taking additional iodine in supplements can cause your thyroid gland to produce too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine. This is known as iodine-induced hyperthyroidism \u2013 sometimes referred to as Jod-Basedow phenomenon. It usually only occurs if you already have nodules in your thyroid gland. Amiodarone Amiodarone is a type of medication known as an anti-arrhythmic, which helps to control an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation). If you have non-toxic nodules in your thyroid gland, taking amiodarone can cause hyperthyroidism because it contains iodine.  Amiodarone can cause a type of hyperthyroidism usually more severe and difficult to treat through a harmful effect on thyroid tissue. This type of hyperthyroidism is called amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Follicular thyroid cancer In rare cases, you may develop an overactive thyroid as a result of thyroid cancer that starts in your thyroid follicles. This can occur if cancer cells in your thyroid gland begin to produce thyroxine or triiodothyronine. This is also known as functioning thyroid cancer.

Stopping the bleeding, cleaning the wound thoroughly and covering it with a plaster or dressing is usually all that's needed. Minor wounds should start to heal within a few days. This page covers: How to treat cuts and grazes When to get medical help When to go to accident and emergency (A&E) How to treat cuts and grazes Stop the bleeding Stop any bleeding before applying a dressing to the wound. Apply pressure to the area using a clean and dry absorbent material \u2013 such as a bandage, towel or handkerchief \u2013 for several minutes. If the cut is to your hand or arm, raise it above your head to help reduce the flow of blood. If the injury is to a lower limb, lie down and raise the affected area above the level of your heart. Clean the wound and apply a dressing When the wound has stopped bleeding, clean it and cover it with a dressing to help stop it becoming infected. To do this: wash and dry your hands thoroughly clean the wound under drinking-quality running tap water \u2013 avoid using antiseptic as it may damage the skin and slow healing pat the area dry with a clean towel apply a sterile adhesive dressing, such as a plaster \u2013 read more about how to apply plasters and other dressings Keep the dressing clean by changing it as often as necessary. Keep the wound dry by using waterproof dressings, which will allow you to take showers. You can remove the dressing after a few days, once the wound has closed itself. Take painkillers if needed If the wound is painful for the first few days, you can take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. When to get medical help Call NHS 111 or visit your local walk-in centre, minor injuries unit or GP surgery if there's a risk your wound could become infected, or you think it's already infected. A wound is at risk of infection if: it has been contaminated with dirt, pus or other bodily fluids there was something in the wound before it was cleaned, such as gravel or a shard of glass it has a jagged edge it's longer than 5cm (2 inches) it was caused by an animal or human bite Signs a wound has become infected include: swelling, redness and increasing pain in the affected area pus forming in or around the wound feeling generally unwell a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above swollen glands under the chin or in the neck, armpits or groin An infected wound can usually be successfully treated with a short course of antibiotics. When to go to A&E Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible if: you cannot stop the bleeding you're bleeding from an artery \u2013 blood from an artery comes out in spurts with each beat of the heart, and is bright red and usually hard to control you experience persisting or significant loss of sensation near the wound or you're having trouble moving any body parts you have received a severe cut to the face \u2013 you may require urgent treatment to prevent scarring you have received a cut to the palm of your hand and it looks infected \u2013 these types of infection can spread quickly there's a possibility a foreign body is still inside the wound the wound is very large or the injury has caused a lot of tissue damage In A&E, your wound will be examined to determine whether there's any risk of infection. You may need a booster injection to prevent tetanus, and your wound may be closed with stitches, strips or special glue before a dressing is applied. If your wound is at risk of infection, it won't usually be closed because this may trap any infection inside. Instead, it will be packed with a non-sticky dressing before being covered with a protective dressing until it's safe to close.

Despite the name, there's no clear evidence to suggest that growing pains are the result of growth spurts. This is why some doctors prefer to use the term 'recurrent nocturnal limb pain in children'. What are the symptoms? Growing pains are felt as intense, cramp-like pain in both legs. They most often affect the calves, shins or ankles, but can also affect the thighs. The pains develop in the evening or at night (often after more active days), but shouldn't be present in the morning. Your child's ability to walk shouldn't be affected by growing pains and there should be no signs of limp, physical injury or infection. If your child's symptoms are different to those described above it's unlikely they have growing pains. For example, if only one leg is affected or they're limping. In these cases, take your child to see a GP (see below), as they may have an underlying medical condition. What causes growing pains? The cause of growing pains is unknown, although they seem to be more common in active children and children with loose, flexible joints (joint hypermobility). They also tend to run in families. There's no clear evidence to suggest they're the result of growth spurts or any underlying conditions. What to do Growing pains can usually be treated at home. You can give your child paracetamol or ibuprofen to manage the pain. Sometimes, giving them painkillers before bedtime after an active day can prevent them waking in the night. However, children under 16 should not be given aspirin unless your doctor specifically advises this. You can also try firmly massaging your child's leg muscles and joints or applying warmth to their legs, for example with heat packs. Supportive footwear such as trainers might help prevent growing pains. Make sure any shoelaces are tied and that shoes with Velcro are fastened firmly. When to see your GP See your GP if your child's symptoms are particularly severe or suggest they may have another condition, such as: pain in just one leg pain also affecting the arms or back pain that occurs every night or continues during the day swollen joints a high temperature (fever) loss of appetite weight loss reluctance to walk, or a limp with no obvious cause Your GP will want to rule out an injury or other illnesses, such as arthritis, vitamin D deficiency (rickets) or even leukaemia if your child is unwell. They may refer your child to hospital for further assessment. Link with restless legs syndrome? Some doctors are investigating whether there's a link between growing pains and restless legs syndrome (RLS). RLS is a condition of the nervous system that causes: an overwhelming urge to move the legs an unpleasant sensation in the legs that eases once the legs are moved It's not currently known whether growing pains are an early form of RLS, or an entirely separate condition.

There are two main types of restricted growth: proportionate short stature (PSS) \u2013 a general lack of growth, where the length of the trunk and limbs are in proportion disproportionate short stature (DSS) \u2013 where the limbs are shorter or out of proportion with other parts of the body As well as having short stature, some people with restricted growth also have other physical problems, such as bowed legs or an unusually curved spine. However, most people don't have any other serious problems. They can often live a relatively normal life and have a normal life expectancy. Read more about the symptoms of restricted growth. What causes restricted growth? The most common cause of PSS is being born to small parents, but it can sometimes occur as a result of the body not producing enough growth hormone. Certain genetic syndromes, such as Turner syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome, can also cause PSS. DSS usually occurs as part of a genetic condition, such as achondroplasia. Many children born with DSS have parents of average height and the faulty gene causing the condition occurred by chance. If your child is diagnosed with restricted growth, tests will be carried out to try to identify the underlying cause. Read more about the causes of restricted growth and diagnosing restricted growth. Managing restricted growth Treatments recommended for people with restricted growth depend on the cause of the condition and any associated problems they have. A number of different healthcare professionals will usually be involved in your care. Some people with restricted growth may benefit from treatment with growth hormone injections, which can help a child with restricted growth grow more than they otherwise would. In cases of DSS where the legs are particularly short, a leg-lengthening procedure is sometimes used, although this is controversial and there is uncertainty about its safety and effectiveness.

It occurs when the body's immune system attacks part of the nervous system. The exact cause of Guillain-Barré syndrome is unknown. However, most people (around 60%) develop the condition shortly after having a viral or bacterial infection. It's thought infection may trigger the immune system to attack nerve roots and peripheral nerves. Read more about causes of Guillain-Barré syndrome. The symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome usually develop two to four weeks after a minor infection, such as a cold, sore throat or gastroenteritis (an infection of the stomach and bowel). Symptoms often start in your feet and hands before spreading to your arms and then your legs. Initially, you may have: pain, tingling and numbness progressive muscle weakness co-ordination problems and unsteadiness (you may be unable to walk unaided) The weakness usually affects both sides of your body, and may get worse over several days. Read more about the symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome.  The peripheral nervous system The peripheral nervous system is the network of nerves that lie outside the central nervous system, including the motor nerves, which the brain uses to control the muscles. In Guillain-Barré syndrome, the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) attacks these nerves, causing them to become inflamed and stop working. Diagnosing Guillain-Barré syndrome It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish the symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome from other brain and nervous system disorders. Therefore, two tests are usually used to confirm the diagnosis. They are: nerve conduction studies and electromyography (EMG) \u2013 tests that measure nerve and muscle function lumbar puncture \u2013 where a small needle is used to remove a small amount of fluid from the spinal canal for analysis You may also have blood tests to rule out other possible causes. Read more about how Guillain-Barré syndrome is diagnosed. Treating Guillain-Barré syndrome Guillain-Barré syndrome is treated in hospital in a general ward, a neurology ward or an intensive care unit (ICU), depending on the severity of the condition. There are two main treatments: intravenous immunoglobulin plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) These treatments target the antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) produced by your immune system to prevent them further damaging your peripheral nerves. Intravenous immunoglobulin is slightly safer and easier to give than plasma exchange. However, both treatments are equally effective. Read more about how Guillain-Barré syndrome is treated. Recovery Most people with Guillain-Barré syndrome make a full recovery. However, you may need to spend several weeks or months in hospital and it may take a year or more to fully recover. Therapies such as counselling, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy are available to help you recover. Read more about recovering from Guillain-Barré syndrome. Complications Some people won't recover completely from Guillain-Barré syndrome and up to 20% of people still experience some muscle weakness after three years. Possible long-term complications include: not being able to walk unaided \u2013 for example, needing a wheelchair loss of sensation (sensory ataxia) that may cause a lack of co-ordination loss of balance muscle weakness in your arms or legs problems with your sense of touch (dysaesthesia) \u2013 often felt as a burning or tingling sensation Some people with Guillain-Barré syndrome also experience persistent fatigue (extreme tiredness). In rare cases, complications can be life-threatening, particularly in the 'acute' phase when a person is most unwell. Read more about the complications of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Who is affected Guillain-Barré syndrome is rare, affecting about 1,200 people in the UK every year. It affects slightly more men than women and can occur at any age. However, it's most common in adults between the ages of 30-50 years. Information about you If you have Guillain-Barré syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Most adults in the UK have gum disease to some degree and most people experience it at least once. It's much less common in children. If you have gum disease, your gums may bleed when you brush your teeth and you may have bad breath. This early stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis. If gingivitis isn't treated, a condition called periodontitis can develop. This affects more tissues that support teeth and hold them in place. If periodontitis isn't treated, the bone in your jaw may be damaged and small spaces can open up between the gum and teeth. Your teeth can become loose and may eventually fall out. Read more about the symptoms of gum disease. What causes gum disease? Gum disease is caused by a build-up of plaque on the teeth. Plaque is a sticky substance that contains bacteria. Some bacteria in plaque are harmless, but some are harmful for the health of your gums. If you don't remove plaque from your teeth by brushing them, it builds up and irritates your gums. This can lead to redness with bleeding, swelling and soreness. Read more about the causes of gum disease. Seeing your dentist You should make an appointment to see your dentist if your gums are painful, swollen or if they bleed when you brush your teeth. Find a dentist near you. Your dentist can carry out a thorough dental examination to check the health of your gums, which may involve inserting a thin metal stick with a bend in one end (periodontal probe) beside your teeth. In some cases, a number of X-rays may be needed to check the condition of your teeth and jaw bone. Preventing and treating gum disease Mild cases of gum disease can usually be treated by maintaining a good level of oral hygiene. This includes brushing your teeth at least twice a day and flossing regularly. You should also make sure you attend regular dental check-ups. In most cases, your dentist or dental hygienist will be able to give your teeth a thorough clean and remove any hardened plaque (tartar). They'll also be able to show you how to clean your teeth effectively to help prevent plaque building up in the future. If you have severe gum disease, you'll usually need to have further medical and dental treatment and, in some cases, surgery may need to be carried out. This will usually be performed by a specialist in gum problems (periodontics). Read more about treating gum disease and keeping your teeth clean. Dental check-ups It's important to have regular dental check-ups so any problems with your teeth and gums can be detected and treated early. If you've never had gum disease and have good oral health, you may only need to visit your dentist every one to two years for a check-up. You may need to visit your dentist more frequently if you've had problems with gum disease in the past. At each appointment your dentist will advise when you need your next appointment. If you have an increased risk of developing gum problems \u2013 for example, if you smoke or have diabetes \u2013 you may be advised to visit your dentist more often so your teeth and gums can be closely monitored. Complications of gum disease If you have untreated gum disease that develops into periodontitis, it can lead to further complications, such as: gum abscesses (painful collections of pus) receding gums loose teeth loss of teeth Read more about the complications of gum disease. NHS dentists Everyone should be able to access good quality NHS dental services. There's no need to register with a dentist. Simply find a practice that's convenient for you, whether it's near home or work, and phone to see if any appointments are available. Read more about how to find an NHS dentist.

Proponents of \"leaky gut syndrome\" claim that many symptoms and conditions are caused by the immune system reacting to germs, toxins or other substances that have been absorbed into the bloodstream via a porous (\"leaky\") bowel. While it's true that some conditions and medications can cause a \"leaky\" gut (what scientists call increased intestinal permeability), there is currently little evidence to support the theory that a porous bowel is the direct cause of any significant, widespread problems. There is also little evidence that the \"treatments\" some people claim help to reduce bowel \"leakiness\", such as nutritional supplements and herbal remedies, have any beneficial effect for most of the conditions they supposedly help. What can cause a \"leaky\" bowel? The inside of the bowel is lined by a single layer of cells that make up the mucosal barrier (the barrier between the inside of the gut and the rest of the body). This barrier is effective at absorbing nutrients, but prevents most large molecules and germs passing from inside the bowel into the bloodstream and potentially causing widespread symptoms. In some circumstances, this barrier can become less effective and \"leaky\", although this in itself is not generally thought to be sufficient to cause serious problems. Alcohol and certain painkillers Alcohol, aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen are well-known irritants of the bowel lining. They can damage the seals between cells, allowing some substances to pass through the gaps and into the bloodstream. Gastroenterologists (specialists in gut conditions) generally agree that these irritants don't usually cause anything more than just mild inflammation of a particular area of the bowel. This will usually cause no obvious symptoms and will improve over time if you stop taking the medication or stop drinking alcohol. At the very worst, the inflammation might be bad enough to occasionally cause ulcers in the bowel lining. Certain conditions and treatments The following conditions and treatments can also damage the seals in the bowel lining: inflammatory bowel diseases \u2013 such as Crohn's disease infections of the intestines \u2013 such as salmonella, norovirus and giardiasis  coeliac disease  chemotherapy medicines chronic kidney disease   radiotherapy to the abdomen (tummy) immunosuppressants (medicines that weaken the immune system) HIV\/AIDS  cystic fibrosis   type 1 diabetes sepsis complicated surgery Generally, even in these situations treatment for a \"leaky\" bowel isn\u2019t necessary. However, under certain circumstances people with Crohn's disease, for example, may benefit from a liquid diet to reduce bowel inflammation, which also improves the \u201Cleaky\u201D bowel (read more about treating Crohn's disease). The \"leaky gut syndrome\" theory Exponents of \"leaky gut syndrome\" \u2013 largely nutritionists and practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine \u2013 believe the bowel lining can become irritated and \"leaky\" as the result of a much wider range of factors, including an overgrowth of yeast or bacteria in the bowel, a poor diet and the overuse of antibiotics. They believe that undigested food particles, bacterial toxins and germs can pass through the \"leaky\" gut wall and into the bloodstream, triggering the immune system and causing persistent inflammation throughout the body. This, they say, is linked to a much wider range of health problems, including: food allergies  migraine  tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome   asthma  lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis (MS) skin conditions such as scleroderma and eczema autism  However, there is currently little evidence to suggest these conditions are in fact caused by having a \"leaky\" gut. Promoted products Many different \"treatments\" have been suggested by people who promote the idea of \"leaky gut syndrome\", including diet books, nutritional supplements (containing probiotics, for example), herbal remedies, gluten-free foods and other special diets, such as a low FODMAP, low sugar or antifungal diet. However, you should be wary of treatments offered by people who claim to be able to \"cure\" \"leaky gut syndrome\", as there is little scientific evidence to suggest they are beneficial for many of the conditions they are claimed to help. Some people even promote various nutritional \"treatments\" for autism, despite conflicting evidence and a recommendation from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) that special diets shouldn't be used to treat the main symptoms of the condition. Some of the dietary changes suggested for \u201Cleaky gut syndrome\u201D (such as a low FODMAP diet) can help people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but these seem to work irrespective of the presence of a \u201Cleaky\u201D gut. Generally, eliminating foods from the diet is not a good idea unless it's strictly necessary (for example, if you have coeliac disease) and done on the advice of a healthcare professional, as it can lead to nutritional deficiencies.  Advice and further information If you have symptoms that are not explained by a diagnosis, it may help to read the topic on medically unexplained symptoms. Such mystery symptoms are surprisingly common, accounting for up to a fifth of all GP consultations in the UK.  If you have been diagnosed with a particular health condition, you can look it up in our A-Z index of treatments and conditions, where you will find reliable, evidence-based information about its treatment. Generally, it is wise to view \"holistic\" and \"natural health\" websites with scepticism \u2013 do not assume that the information they provide is correct or based on scientific facts or evidence.

What is gynaecomastia? Gynaecomastia (sometimes referred to as \"man boobs\") is a common condition that causes boys\u2019 and men\u2019s breasts to swell and become larger than normal. It is most common in teenage boys and older men. What are the signs of gynaecomastia? Signs vary from a small amount of extra tissue around the nipples to more prominent breasts. It can affect one or both breasts. Sometimes, the breast tissue can be tender or painful, but this isn\u2019t always the case. What causes gynaecomastia? Gynaecomastia can have several causes. Hormone imbalance Gynaecomastia can be caused by an imbalance between the sex hormones testosterone and oestrogen. Oestrogen causes breast tissue to grow. While all men produce some oestrogen, they usually have much higher levels of testosterone, which stops the oestrogen from causing breast tissue to grow. If the balance of hormones in the body changes, this can cause a man\u2019s breasts to grow. Sometimes, the cause of this imbalance is unknown. Obesity Some growth in breast tissue is not due to extra body fat from being overweight, so losing weight or doing more exercise may not improve the condition. However, a common reason for gynaecomastia is that being very overweight (obese) can increase levels of oestrogen, which can cause breast tissue to grow. Newborn baby boys Gynaecomastia can affect newborn baby boys, because oestrogen passes through the placenta from the mother to the baby. This is temporary and will disappear a few weeks after the baby is born. Puberty During puberty, boys\u2019 hormone levels vary. If the level of testosterone drops, oestrogen can cause breast tissue to grow. Many teenage boys have some degree of breast enlargement. Gynaecomastia at puberty usually clears up as boys get older and their hormone levels become more stable. Older age As men get older, they produce less testosterone. Older men also tend to have more body fat, and this can cause more oestrogen to be produced. These changes in hormone levels can lead to excess breast tissue growth.
