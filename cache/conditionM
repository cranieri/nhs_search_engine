Central vision is what you see when you focus straight ahead. In AMD, this vision becomes increasingly blurred, which means: reading becomes difficult  colours appear less vibrant people's faces are difficult to recognise This sight loss usually happens gradually over time, although it can sometimes be rapid. AMD doesn't affect your peripheral vision (side vision), which means it will not cause complete blindness.   Read more about the symptoms of age-related macular degeneration and the complications of age-related macular degeneration. When to seek medical advice Visit your GP or optometrist if your vision is getting gradually worse. If your vision suddenly gets worse, images are distorted or you notice blind spots in your field of vision, seek medical advice immediately and book an emergency appointment with an optometrist. If AMD is suspected, you'll be referred to an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for tests and any necessary treatment. Read more about how age-related macular degeneration is diagnosed. Why it happens Macular degeneration develops when the part of the eye responsible for central vision (the macula) is unable to function as effectively as it used to. There are two main types \u2013 dry AMD and wet AMD. Dry AMD Dry AMD develops when the cells of the macula become damaged by a build-up of deposits called drusen. It's the most common and least serious type of AMD, accounting for around 9 out of 10 cases. Vision loss is gradual, occurring over many years. However, an estimated 1 in 10 people with dry AMD go on to develop wet AMD. Wet AMD Wet AMD \u2013 sometimes called neovascular AMD \u2013 develops when abnormal blood vessels form underneath the macula and damage its cells. Wet AMD is more serious than dry AMD. Without treatment, vision can deteriorate within days. Read more about the causes of age-related macular degeneration. Who's affected? AMD currently affects more than 600,000 people in the UK and is the leading cause of vision loss. By 2020, it's predicted almost 700,000 people will have late-stage AMD in the UK.  For reasons that are unclear, AMD tends to be more common in women than men. It's also more common in white and Chinese people. The condition is most common in people over the age of 50. It's estimated 1 in every 10 people over 65 have some degree of AMD. Treating macular degeneration There's currently no cure for either type of AMD. With dry AMD, treatment aims to help a person make the most of their remaining vision \u2013 for example, magnifying lenses can be used to make reading easier. There's some evidence to suggest a diet rich in leafy green vegetables may slow the progression of dry AMD. Wet AMD can be treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medication. This aims to stop your vision getting worse by preventing further blood vessels developing. In some cases, laser surgery can also be used to destroy abnormal blood vessels. The early diagnosis and treatment of wet AMD is essential for reducing the risk of severe vision loss. Read more about treating age-related macular degeneration. Reducing your risk It's not always possible to prevent macular degeneration because it's not clear exactly what triggers the processes that cause the condition. Your risk of developing AMD is closely linked to your age and whether you have a family history of the condition. However, you may be able to reduce your risk of developing AMD, or help prevent it getting worse, by: stopping smoking if you smoke eating a healthy, balanced diet that includes plenty of fruit and vegetables moderating your consumption of alcohol \u2013 read more about alcohol units and recommendations trying to achieve or maintain a healthy weight wearing UV-absorbing glasses when outside for long periods Juvenile macular degeneration In rare cases, macular degeneration can affect younger people. This is sometimes known as juvenile macular degeneration. It can be present at birth or develop later, but it's almost always caused by an inherited genetic disorder, such as: Stargardt's disease \u2013 the most common cause of juvenile macular degeneration, this can start in childhood or early adulthood Best's disease \u2013 also known as Best's vitelliform macular dystrophy Sorsby's dystrophy \u2013 this often begins between the ages of 30 and 40  Page last reviewed: 24\/08\/2015 Next review due: 24\/08\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The retina is the light-sensitive film at the back of the eye. In the centre is the macula \u2013 the part responsible for central and fine detail vision needed for tasks such as reading. In the early stages, a macular hole can cause blurred and distorted vision. Straight lines may look wavy or bowed, and you may have trouble reading small print. After a while, you may see a small black patch or a \"missing patch\" in the centre of your vision. You won't feel any pain and the condition doesn't lead to a total loss of sight. Surgery is usually needed to repair the hole (see below). This is often successful, but you need to be aware of the possible complications of treatment. Your vision will never completely return to normal, but it's usually improved by having surgery. Why does it happen? We don't know why macular holes develop. The vast majority of cases happen spontaneously (without an obvious cause). They most often affect people aged 60-80, and are twice as common in women as men. One possible risk factor is a condition called vitreomacular traction. As you get older, the vitreous jelly in the middle of your eye starts to pull away from the retina and macula at the back of the eye. If some of the vitreous jelly remains attached, it can lead to a macular hole. A few cases may be associated with: retinal detachment \u2013 when the retina begins to pull away from the blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients severe injury to the eye being slightly long-sighted (hyperopic) being very short-sighted (myopic) persistent swelling of the central retina (cystoid macular oedema) What should I do? If you have blurred or distorted vision, or there's a black spot in the centre of your vision, see your GP or optician as soon as possible. You'll probably be referred to an ophthalmologist (a specialist in eye conditions). If you do have a macular hole and you don't seek help, your central vision will probably get gradually worse. After a year, you'll be unable to read even the largest print on an eye test chart. There's evidence that relatively early treatment (within months) gives a better outcome in terms of improvement in vision. There's a very small chance the hole may close and heal by itself, so for this reason, your ophthalmologist may want to monitor its progression before recommending treatment. What is the treatment and how successful is it? Vitrectomy surgery A macular hole can often be repaired using an operation called a vitrectomy, with inner limiting membrane (ILM) peel and gas. If you've had the hole for less than a year, there's around a 90% chance the operation will be successful in closing it. More than 70% of people successfully treated will be able to read two or three additional lines on a standard vision chart, compared to before the operation. Even if surgery does not achieve this degree of improvement, your vision will at least become stable, and you may find you have less distortion of vision. In a minority of patients, the hole doesn't close despite surgery, and the central vision can continue to deteriorate. However, a second operation can still be successful in closing the hole. Ocriplasmin injection If a macular hole is caused by vitreomacular traction, it may be possible to treat it with an injection of ocriplasmin into the eye. The injection helps the vitreous jelly separate from the back of the eye and allows the macular hole to close. This treatment is successful at closing a macular hole in around 40% of cases. The injection takes a few seconds and you'll be given local anaesthetic  as eye drops or an injection, so you won't feel any pain. You'll also be given eye drops to dilate your pupil, so the ophthalmologist can see the back of your eye. An ocriplasmin injection is usually only available in the early stages, while the macular hole is less than 400 micrometres wide, but causing severe symptoms. Ocriplasmin can cause some mild side effects, which usually go away, such as: temporary discomfort floaters flashing lights dimming of vision yellow tinge to the vision A small number of people may develop more severe side effects, such as a noticeable loss of vision, enlargement of the macular hole or retinal detachment. Surgery is usually needed to correct macular hole enlargement or retinal detachment. You won't be able to drive after the injection, as the eye drops cause your vision to be blurry. However, you should have normal, comfortable vision the day after. If the ocriplasmin injection fails to close the macular hole, which happens in around 60% of cases, vitrectomy surgery will be needed to close the macular hole and improve the vision. What does vitrectomy surgery involve? Macular hole surgery is a form of keyhole surgery performed under a microscope. Three small incisions (one millimetre in size) are made in the white of the eye and very fine instruments are inserted. First, the vitreous jelly is removed (vitrectomy) and then a very delicate layer (the inner limiting membrane) is carefully peeled off the surface of the retina around the hole, to release the forces that keep the hole open. The eye is then filled with a temporary gas bubble, which presses the hole flat onto the back of the eye to help it seal. The bubble of gas will block the vision while it's present, but it slowly disappears over a period of about four to eight weeks. Macular hole surgery usually takes 45-90 minutes and can be done while you're awake (under local anaesthetic) or asleep (under general anaesthetic). Most patients opt for a local anaesthetic, which involves a numbing injection around the eye, so no pain is felt during the operation. You may be able to go home the same day, but most patients need to stay in hospital overnight. What can I expect after the operation? Temporary poor vision With the gas in place, the vision in your eye will be very poor \u2013 a bit like having your eye open under water. Your balance will be affected and you'll have trouble judging distances, so be aware of steps and kerbs. You may have problems with activities such as pouring liquids or picking up objects. In the 7-10 days after the operation, the gas bubble slowly shrinks. As this happens, the space that was taken up by the gas fills with the natural fluid made by your eye and your vision should start to improve. It generally takes six to eight weeks for the gas to become absorbed and for vision to improve. Mild pain or discomfort Your eye may be mildly sore after the operation, and will probably feel sensitive. Contact your ophthalmologist immediately or go to your nearest eye accident & emergency (A&E) department if at any time: you're in serious pain your vision gets worse than it was on the day after the surgery Protective dressing When you wake up, your eye will be padded with a protective plastic shield taped over it. The pad and shield can be removed the day after the operation. Getting home If you've had a general anaesthetic, you will not be able to leave the hospital unless a responsible adult is there to help you get home. Medication You'll usually be prescribed two or three types of drops to take after surgery: an antibiotic a steroid a pupil-dilating agent You'll be seen again in the clinic about two weeks after the operation and if all is well, the drops will be reduced over the following weeks. Do I need to position myself face down after the operation? Once at home, you may have to spend several hours during the day with your head held still and in a specific position, called posturing. The aim of lying or sitting face down is to keep the gas bubble in contact with the hole as much as possible, to encourage it to close. There's evidence that lying face down improves the success rate for larger holes, but it may not be needed for smaller holes. If you're asked to do some face-down positioning, your head should be positioned so the tip of your nose points straight down to the ground. This could be done sitting at a table or lying flat on your stomach on a bed or sofa. Your doctor will advise you on whether you need to do this and, if so, for how long. You may find it helpful to read Moorfields Eye Hospital's instructions for post-operative posturing (PDF, 1.7Mb). If face-down posturing isn't advised, you may simply be told to avoid lying on your back for at least two weeks after the surgery. Sleeping You'll need to sleep with your head on one side, resting on an ear. You may be asked to avoid sleeping on your back for at least one month after your operation, to make sure the gas bubble is in contact with the macular hole as much as possible. If you can't lie on your side, you should sleep propped up with pillows so you're at a 45-degree angle. If you have concerns about sleeping positions, speak to your doctor or nurse. Am I able to travel after macular hole surgery? You must not fly or travel to high altitude on land while the gas bubble is still in your eye (up to 12 weeks after surgery). If you ignore this, the bubble will expand at altitude, causing very high pressure inside your eye. This will result in severe pain and permanent loss of vision. What if I need another operation shortly after my treatment? If you need a general anaesthetic while the gas is still in your eye, it's vital you tell the anaesthetist, so they can avoid certain anaesthetic agents that can cause expansion of the bubble. Can I drive after the operation? No \u2013 the gas bubble will still be present in your eye for six to eight weeks after your surgery, so during this time you can't drive a vehicle of any sort. None of these exclusions apply once the gas has fully absorbed. You'll notice the bubble shrinking and will be aware when it has completely gone. How much time will I need off work? Most people will need at least two weeks off work, although this will depend to an extent on the type of work you do and the speed of recovery. Discuss this with your surgeon. What are the possible complications of macular hole surgery? It's unlikely that you'll suffer harmful effects from a macular hole operation. However, you should be aware of these six possible complications: Failure of the hole to close. This happens in 1-2 out of 10 patients. If the hole fails to close, your vision may be a little worse than before the surgery. It's usually possible to repeat the surgery.  Cataract. This means the natural lens in your eye has gone cloudy. You'll almost certainly get a cataract after the surgery, usually within a year, if you've not already had a cataract operation. The cataract may be removed at the same time the hole is being repaired. Retinal detachment. The retina detaches from the back of the eye in 1-2% of patients having macular hole surgery. This can potentially cause blindness, but it's usually repairable in a further operation. Bleeding. This occurs very rarely, but severe bleeding within the eye can result in blindness. Infection. This is also very rare, occurring in an estimated 1 in 1,000 patients. Infection needs further treatment and could lead to blindness. Raised eye pressure. An increase in pressure within the eye is quite common in the days after macular hole surgery, usually due to the expanding gas bubble. In most cases, it's short-lived and controlled with extra eye drops or tablets to reduce the pressure, protecting the eye from damage. If the high pressure is extreme or becomes prolonged, there may be some damage to the optic nerve as a result.  How successful is macular hole surgery? The most important factor in predicting whether the hole closes as a result of surgery is the length of time the hole has been present. If you've had a hole for less than six months, there's about a 90% chance your operation will be successful (9 in 10 operations will successfully close the hole). If the hole has been present for a year or more, this success rate drops to about 60%. Most people have some improvement in vision after they've recovered from the surgery. At the very least, the operation normally prevents your sight from getting any worse. Your doctor will speak to you in more detail about what results you can expect from the surgery. Even if surgery doesn't successfully correct your central vision, a macular hole never affects your peripheral vision, so you'd never go completely blind from this condition.  Can I develop a macular hole in my other eye? After carefully examining your other eye, your surgeon should be able to tell you the risk of developing a macular hole in this eye. In some people this is extremely unlikely, in others there's a 1 in 10 chance of developing a macular hole in the other eye. It's very important to monitor any changes in the vision of your healthy eye and report these to your eye specialist, GP or optician urgently. How does it differ from age-related macular degeneration? A macular hole isn't the same as macular degeneration, although they affect the same area of the eye and can sometimes both be present in the same eye. Age-related macular degeneration is damage to the macula, leading to the gradual loss of central vision. It's unclear what causes it, but getting older, smoking and a family history of the condition are known to increase your risk.

It causes brain damage that worsens rapidly over time. Symptoms of CJD include: loss of intellect and memory change in personality loss of balance and co-ordination slurred speech vision problems and blindness abnormal jerking movements progressive loss of brain function and mobility Most people with CJD will die within a year of the symptoms starting, usually from infection. This is because the immobility caused by CJD can make people with the condition vulnerable to infection. Read more about the symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and diagnosing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. What causes CJD? CJD appears to be caused by an abnormal infectious protein called a prion. These prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells, resulting in the symptoms described above. While the abnormal prions are technically infectious, they're very different to viruses and bacteria. For example, prions aren't destroyed by the extremes of heat and radiation used to kill bacteria and viruses, and antibiotics or antiviral medicines have no effect on them. Read more about the causes of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Types of CJD There are four main types of CJD, which are described below. Sporadic CJD Sporadic CJD is the most common type. The precise cause of sporadic CJD is unclear, but it's been suggested that a normal brain protein changes abnormally ('misfolds') and turns into a prion. Most cases of sporadic CJD occur in adults aged between 45 and 75. On average, symptoms develop at age 60-65 years. Despite being the most common type of CJD, sporadic CJD is still very rare, affecting only one or two people in every million each year in the UK. In the UK during 2014, there were 90 recorded deaths from sporadic CJD. Variant CJD Variant CJD is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or 'mad cow disease'), a similar prion disease to CJD. Since the link between variant CJD and BSE was discovered in 1996, strict controls have proved very effective in preventing meat from infected cattle from entering the food chain (see preventing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease for more information). However, the average time it takes for the symptoms of variant CJD to occur after initial infection (the incubation period) is still unclear. The incubation period could be very long (over 10 years) in some people, so those exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced can still develop variant CJD. The prion that causes variant CJD can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, although this has only happened four times in the UK. There have been 177 recorded cases of variant CJD in the UK to date and there were no recorded deaths from the condition in the UK during 2014. Familial or inherited CJD Familial CJD is a very rare genetic condition where one of the genes a person inherits from their parent (the prion protein gene) carries a mutation that causes prions to form in their brain during adulthood, triggering the symptoms of CJD. It affects about 1 in every 9 million people in the UK. The symptoms of familial CJD usually first develop in the early 50s. In the UK during 2014, there were 10 deaths from familial CJD and similar inherited prion diseases. Iatrogenic CJD Iatrogenic CJD is where the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment. For example, a common cause of iatrogenic CJD in the past was growth hormone treatment using human pituitary growth hormones extracted from deceased individuals, some of whom were infected with CJD. Synthetic versions of human growth hormone have been used since 1985, so this is no longer a risk. Iatrogenic CJD can also occur if instruments used during brain surgery on a person with CJD aren't properly cleaned between each surgical procedure and are re-used on another person. However, increased awareness of these risks means iatrogenic CJD is now very rare. In the UK during 2014, there were just three deaths from iatrogenic CJD (caused by receiving human growth hormone before 1985). How CJD is treated There's currently no cure for CJD, so treatment aims to relieve symptoms and make the affected person feel as comfortable as possible. This can include using medication such as antidepressants to help with anxiety and depression, and painkillers to relieve pain. Some people will need nursing care and assistance with feeding. Read more about treating Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Information about you If you have CJD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Variant CJD compensation scheme In October 2001, the government announced a compensation scheme for UK victims of variant CJD.

An MRI scanner is a large tube that contains powerful magnets. You lie inside the tube during the scan. An MRI scan can be used to examine almost any part of the body, including the: brain and spinal cord bones and joints breasts heart and blood vessels internal organs, such as the liver, womb or prostate gland  The results of an MRI scan can be used to help diagnose conditions, plan treatments and assess how effective previous treatment has been. Read a guide to NHS waiting times. What happens during an MRI scan? During an MRI scan, you lie on a flat bed that's moved into the scanner. Depending on the part of your body being scanned, you'll be moved into the scanner either head first or feet first. The MRI scanner is operated by a radiographer, who is trained in carrying out imaging investigations. They control the scanner using a computer, which is in a different room, to keep it away from the magnetic field generated by the scanner. You'll be able to talk to the radiographer through an intercom and they'll be able to see you on a television monitor throughout the scan. At certain times during the scan, the scanner will make loud tapping noises. This is the electric current in the scanner coils being turned on and off. You'll be given earplugs or headphones to wear. It's very important to keep as still as possible during your MRI scan. The scan lasts 15 to 90 minutes, depending on the size of the area being scanned and how many images are taken. Read more about how an MRI scan is performed. How does an MRI scan work? Most of the human body is made up of water molecules, which consist of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. At the centre of each hydrogen atom is an even smaller particle, called a proton. Protons are like tiny magnets and are very sensitive to magnetic fields. When you lie under the powerful scanner magnets, the protons in your body line up in the same direction, in the same way that a magnet can pull the needle of a compass. Short bursts of radio waves are then sent to certain areas of the body, knocking the protons out of alignment. When the radio waves are turned off, the protons realign. This sends out radio signals, which are picked up by receivers. These signals provide information about the exact location of the protons in the body. They also help to distinguish between the various types of tissue in the body, because the protons in different types of tissue realign at different speeds and produce distinct signals. In the same way that millions of pixels on a computer screen can create complex pictures, the signals from the millions of protons in the body are combined to create a detailed image of the inside of the body. Safety An MRI scan is a painless and safe procedure. You may find it uncomfortable if you have claustrophobia, but most people find this manageable with support from the radiographer. Going into the scanner feet first may be easier, although this is not always possible. MRI scans don't involve exposing the body to X-ray radiation. This means people who may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of radiation, such as pregnant women and babies, can use them if necessary. However, not everyone can have an MRI scan. For example, they're not always possible for people who have certain types of implants fitted, such as a pacemaker (a battery-operated device that helps to control an irregular heartbeat). Extensive research has been carried out into whether the magnetic fields and radio waves used during MRI scans could pose a risk to the human body. No evidence has been found to suggest there's a risk, which means MRI scans are one of the safest medical procedures currently available. Read more about who can and can't have an MRI scan.

If it isn't diagnosed and treated promptly, it can be fatal. A single mosquito bite is all it takes for someone to become infected. Symptoms of malaria It's important to be aware of the symptoms of malaria if you're travelling to areas where there's a high risk of the disease. Symptoms include: a high temperature (fever) sweats and chills headaches vomiting muscle pains diarrhoea Symptoms usually appear between 7 and 18 days after becoming infected, but in some cases the symptoms may not appear for up to a year, or occasionally even longer. Read more about the symptoms of malaria. When to seek medical attention Seek medical help immediately if you develop symptoms of malaria during or after a visit to an area where the disease is found. You should still seek medical help even if it's several weeks, months or a year after you return from travelling. If there's a possibility you have malaria, a blood test will be carried out to confirm whether or not you're infected. You should receive the results of your blood test on the same day. If you have malaria, treatment will be started straight away. What causes malaria? Malaria is caused by a type of parasite known as Plasmodium. There are many different types of Plasmodia parasites, but only five cause malaria in humans. The Plasmodium parasite is mainly spread by female Anopheles mosquitoes, which mainly bite at dusk and at night. When an infected mosquito bites a human, it passes the parasites into the bloodstream. Malaria can also be spread through blood transfusions and the sharing of needles, but this is very rare. Read more about the causes of malaria and how it's spread. Malaria risk areas Malaria is found in more than 100 countries, mainly in tropical regions of the world, including: large areas of Africa and Asia Central and South America Haiti and the Dominican Republic parts of the Middle East some Pacific islands The 2014 World Malaria Report, published by the World Health Organization (WHO), estimates there were 198 million cases of malaria worldwide and 584,000 deaths in 2013. Malaria is not found in the UK, although about 1,586 travellers were diagnosed with the disease after returning to the UK in 2014, and three people died. The Fit for Travel website has more information about the risk of malaria in specific countries. Preventing malaria Many cases of malaria can be avoided. An easy way to remember is the ABCD approach to prevention: Awareness of risk \u2013 find out whether you're at risk of getting malaria before travelling Bite prevention \u2013 avoid mosquito bites by using insect repellent, covering your arms and legs, and using an insecticide-treated mosquito net Check whether you need to take malaria prevention tablets \u2013 if you do, make sure you take the right antimalarial tablets at the right dose, and finish the course Diagnosis \u2013 seek immediate medical advice if you develop malaria symptoms, as long as up to a year after you return from travelling Speak to your GP if you're planning to visit an area where there's a malaria risk. It may be recommended that you take antimalarial tablets to prevent infection. Read more about preventing malaria. Treating malaria If malaria is diagnosed and treated promptly, virtually everyone will make a full recovery. Treatment should be started as soon as the diagnosis has been confirmed. Antimalarial medication is used to both treat and prevent malaria. Which type of medication is used and the length of treatment will depend on: the type of malaria the severity of your symptoms where you caught malaria whether you took an antimalarial to prevent malaria  whether you're pregnant In some cases, you may be prescribed emergency standby treatment for malaria before you travel. This is usually if there's a risk of you becoming infected with malaria while travelling in a remote area with little or no access to medical care. Read more about treating malaria. Complications of malaria Malaria is a serious illness that can get worse very quickly. It can be fatal if not treated promptly. It can also cause serious complications, including: severe anaemia \u2013 where red blood cells are unable to carry enough oxygen around the body, leading to drowsiness and weakness cerebral malaria \u2013 in rare cases, the small blood vessels leading to the brain can become blocked, causing seizures, brain damage and coma The effects of malaria are usually more severe in pregnant women, babies, young children and the elderly. Pregnant women in particular are usually advised not to travel to malaria risk areas. Read more about the complications of malaria.

It's much less common in men than women, with only around 1 new case of breast cancer diagnosed for every 100,000 men (about 350 to 400 cases) in the UK each year.   The cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts. However, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition called gynaecomastia. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged. Breast cancer in men can also cause nipple problems, such as the nipple turning in on itself (retraction) or nipple discharge. Read more about the symptoms of male breast cancer. When to see your GP You should always talk to your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have problems affecting your nipples, such as discharge. While these symptoms are unlikely to be caused by breast cancer, they should be investigated further.  Why it happens The cause of male breast cancer is unclear, but factors known to increase your chances of developing the condition include: age \u2013 most cases affect men over the age of 60 having a family history of breast cancer (male or female) obesity \u2013 a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more Read more about causes of breast cancer in men. Treating breast cancer in men In most cases, surgery is used to remove the cancer, along with a section of the breast. This may be followed by a long-term course of hormone-blocking therapy using medication, usually a drug called tamoxifen. Tamoxifen helps block the effects of hormones known to stimulate the growth of cancerous cells in breast tissue. It should help prevent the cancer returning. In some cases, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used for the same purpose. Read more about treating breast cancer in men. Outlook The outlook for breast cancer is not as good in men as in women. This is because there's reduced awareness of the condition and it may take longer to diagnose. The survival rates for breast cancer in men largely depend on how far the cancer has spread before it's diagnosed. Breast cancer diagnosed at an early stage can often be treated successfully, but effective treatment is more difficult if the cancer has spread beyond the breast tissue. Unfortunately, many cases are diagnosed after the cancer has already started to spread. Read more about diagnosing breast cancer in men.

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: What is the male pill? In the past 50 years, there have been few changes in male contraception compared with the range of options available to women. Today, the only contraceptive methods available to men are: condoms \u2013 a barrier form of contraception that stops sperm reaching and fertilising an egg vasectomy \u2013 a minor surgical procedure that stops sperm being ejaculated from the penis during sex (it is usually permanent)  Some men use withdrawal to try to prevent pregnancy, when they pull their penis out of their partner's vagina before ejaculating. However, this is not a recommended method of contraception. Sperm can be released from the penis before ejaculation. Ongoing research There are many ongoing research projects into different methods of male contraception. Researchers are optimistic that a safe, effective and reversible method of male contraception will eventually become a reality, although this is still several years away.  Types of research There are two main areas of research into male contraception: hormonal contraception \u2013 where synthetic (man-made) hormones are used to temporarily stop the development of healthy sperm non-hormonal methods \u2013 where other techniques are used to prevent healthy sperm from entering a woman's vagina Hormonal contraception In fertile men, new sperm cells are constantly created in the testicles. This process is triggered by the hormone testosterone. The goal of hormonal contraception research is to find a way of temporarily blocking the effects of testosterone so testicles stop producing healthy sperm cells. However, this needs to be achieved without lowering testosterone levels to such an extent that it triggers side effects, such as a loss of sexual desire. Synthetic testosterone and other steroid combinations One way of doing this is by giving men a synthetic version of testosterone, together with a hormone called progestogen. Progestogens are synthetic versions of a female sex hormone often found in female hormonal contraceptives, such as the progestogen-only pill.  This approach stops the testes producing testosterone which, in most cases, prevents normal sperm production. However, at the same time it keeps the amount of testosterone in the blood normal, preventing side effects. This is a very effective approach, but some men still carry on producing enough sperm to cause a pregnancy. The reason why this happens is unknown, but it may be that some men carry on producing enough testosterone to continue to stimulate some sperm production. Research is now focusing on different combinations of synthetic testosterone and progestogens. Several trials in different countries are looking at the effectiveness and long-term safety of hormonal contraceptives for men, including some phase III trials. Phase III trials are the last clinical trials carried out before a medicine is given a marketing licence. An important disadvantage of using synthetic testosterone is that sperm production is suppressed at different rates in men of different ethnic origins. These differences may be due to genetic, dietary or environmental factors, but the exact reasons are unknown. Understanding the reasons may lead to new ways of providing effective contraception for all men of diverse ethnic backgrounds. Non-hormonal contraception Many of the non-hormonal methods of contraception currently being studied involve the vas deferens. The vas deferens is the tube that sperm pass through on their way to the penis. This tube is cut during a vasectomy. RISUG and the IVD   One promising avenue of research is a technique called reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG). During this technique, a non-toxic synthetic chemical is injected into the vas deferens. The chemical reacts and blocks the vas deferens. It also kills sperm when they come into contact with it. The chemical is effective almost immediately after it is injected. The chemical stays in place until a man decides that he wants to have children. It can then be washed out using another injection which dissolves and flushes it out of the vas deferens. A variation of this technique is the intra-vas device (IVD). It involves injecting a \"plug\" into the vas deferens which can be removed later. The IVD filters out the sperm as it passes through the vas deferens.  Initial results of RISUG and IVD are promising, but further research is needed to assess the long-term effectiveness and safety of both techniques. Reasearch published in 2013 found that blocking certain proteins in the bodies of male mice rendered them infertile, but did not affect their sexual behaviour or the quality of their sperm. It prevented the sperm cells from being launched during ejaculation. When the mice's sperm was used to artificially inseminate female mice, it resulted in pregnancies and healthy baby mice. If a way can be found to block these proteins in human males, this may take research a step closer to producing a male contraceptive pill. However, the research is in the very early stages and a male pill has not been developed. You can find out more about the research into proteins, mice and sperm.   Epididymis Other research is focusing on the epididymis. This is a long, coiled tube behind the testicles that allows sperm to mature normally, which is essential for normal fertility. Attempts have been made to interfere with the way the epididymis works and the way sperm matures inside the epididymis. However, so far neither approach has been successful.  Page last reviewed: 06\/11\/2014 Next review due: 06\/11\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Both men and women can get thrush, though it is more often associated with women. The medical term for thrush is candidiasis. What it looks like In men, it usually affects the head of the penis \u2013 causing irritation, discharge and redness.  Read more about the symptoms of thrush. It can also affect the skin, known as candidal skin infection, and the inside of the mouth, known as oral thrush. Should I see a doctor? If you suspect thrush for the first time, it's best to see a doctor for a diagnosis. This is because the symptoms can be similar to those of a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Your GP will be able to tell the difference. If you've had thrush before and you recognise the symptoms, you can treat it yourself with over-the-counter medication. You should also visit your GP if you have a weakened immune system and you have thrush. This is because there is a risk that a thrush infection could progress to a more serious case of invasive candidiasis. Read our page on the complications of thrush for more information about invasive candidiasis. Treating and preventing thrush You can treat thrush without prescription medications. For thrush affecting your penis, ask your chemist for clotrimazole cream or a tablet called fluconazole. For thrush infections in your groin or elsewhere, the chemist can supply a cream. It's possible for thrush to spread during sex, but it's not an STI. However, both sexual partners may need thrush treatment to prevent re-infection. Re-infection from a female partner is common. Seek advice from a pharmacist or your GP. However, not all cases are caused by sex, and many cases develop in men and women who are not sexually active. Read more about treating thrush.  You can help prevent thrush by cleaning your penis regularly and using a condom while having sex with your partner (if they have thrush). Avoid using perfumed soaps or shower gels on your genitals, as they can cause irritation. Make sure you dry your penis properly after washing. Wearing loose-fitting cotton underwear can help prevent moisture building up under your foreskin, which lowers the chances of the candida fungus multiplying.  What causes thrush? The fungus candida albicans occurs naturally in your body, particularly in warm, moist areas, such as inside the mouth and around the genitals. It does not usually cause problems because it is kept under control by your immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence against illness and infection) and other types of bacteria in the body. However, certain conditions can cause the fungus to multiply and lead to infection. You are more likely to be at risk of thrush if: you have a weakened immune system are obese, with large rolls of skin (an environment where fungi can often thrive) have type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes \u2013 as the high levels of glucose associated with diabetes can encourage the fungus to breed; people with diabetes also tend to sweat more, creating a perfect breeding environment for the fungus Read more about what causes thrush in men.

There are many types of hair loss with different symptoms and causes. Some of the more common types of hair loss are described below, including: male- and female-pattern baldness  alopecia areata scarring alopecia anagen effluvium telogen effluvium Male- and female-pattern baldness Male-pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss, affecting around half of all men by 50 years of age. It usually starts around the late twenties or early thirties and most men have some degree of hair loss by their late thirties. It generally follows a pattern of a receding hairline, followed by thinning of the hair on the crown and temples, leaving a horseshoe shape around the back and sides of the head. Sometimes it can progress to complete baldness, although this is uncommon. Male-pattern baldness is hereditary, which means it runs in families. It's thought to be caused by oversensitive hair follicles, linked to having too much of a certain male hormone. As well as affecting men, it can sometimes affect women (female-pattern baldness). During female-pattern baldness, hair usually only thins on top of the head. It's not clear if female-pattern baldness is hereditary and the causes are less well understood. However, it tends to be more noticeable in women who have been through the menopause (when a woman's periods stop at around age 52), perhaps because they have fewer female hormones. Alopecia areata Alopecia areata causes patches of baldness about the size of a large coin. They usually appear on the scalp but can occur anywhere on the body. It can occur at any age, but mostly affects teenagers and young adults. In most cases of alopecia areata, hair will grow back in a few months. At first, hair may grow back fine and white, but over time it should thicken and regain its normal colour. Some people go on to develop a more severe form of hair loss, such as: alopecia totalis (no scalp hair) alopecia universalis (no hair on the scalp and body) Alopecia areata is caused by a problem with the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness). It's more common among people with other autoimmune conditions, such as an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), diabetes or Down's syndrome. It's also believed some people's genes make them more susceptible to alopecia areata, as one in five people with the condition have a family history of the condition. Alopecia areata can occur at any age, although it's more common in people aged 15-29. It affects one or two people in every 1,000 in the UK. Scarring alopecia  Scarring alopecia, also known as cicatricial alopecia, is usually caused by complications of another condition. In this type of alopecia, the hair follicle (the small hole in your skin that an individual hair grows out of) is completely destroyed. This means your hair won't grow back. Depending on the condition, the skin where the hair has fallen out is likely to be affected in some way. Conditions which can cause scarring alopecia include: scleroderma \u2013 a condition affecting the body's connective (supporting) tissues, resulting in hard, puffy and itchy skin lichen planus \u2013 an itchy rash affecting many areas of the body discoid lupus \u2013 a mild form of lupus affecting the skin, causing scaly marks and hair loss folliculitis decalvans \u2013 a rare form of alopecia that most commonly affects men, causing baldness and scarring of the affected areas frontal fibrosing alopecia \u2013 a type of alopecia that affects post-menopausal women where the hair follicles are damaged, and the hair falls out and is unable to grow back Scarring alopecia occurs in both males and females, but is less common in children than adults. It accounts for about 7% of hair loss cases. Anagen effluvium Anagen effluvium is widespread hair loss that can affect your scalp, face and body. One of the most common causes of this type of hair loss is the cancer treatment chemotherapy. In some cases, other cancer treatments \u2013 including immunotherapy and radiotherapy \u2013 may also cause hair loss. The hair loss is usually noticeable within a few weeks of starting treatment. However, not all chemotherapy drugs cause hair loss and sometimes the hair loss is so small it's hardly noticeable. It may be possible to reduce hair loss from chemotherapy by wearing a special cap that keeps the scalp cool. However, scalp cooling is not always effective and not widely available. In most cases, hair loss in anagen effluvium is temporary. Your hair should start to grow back a few months after chemotherapy has stopped. Telogen effluvium Telogen effluvium is a common type of alopecia where there is widespread thinning of the hair, rather than specific bald patches. Your hair may feel thinner, but you're unlikely to lose it all and your other body hair isn't usually affected. Telogen effluvium can be caused by your body reacting to: hormonal changes, such as those that take place when a woman is pregnant intense emotional stress intense physical stress, such as childbirth a short-term illness, such as a severe infection or an operation a long-term illness, such as cancer or liver disease changes in your diet, such as crash dieting some medications, such as anticoagulants (medicines that reduce the ability of your blood to clot) or beta-blockers (used to treat a number of conditions, such as high blood pressure) In most cases of telogen effluvium, your hair will stop falling out and start to grow back within six months. How is hair loss treated? More common types of hair loss, such as male-pattern baldness, don't need treatment because they're a natural part of ageing and don't pose a risk to your health. However, any type of hair loss can be distressing, so you should see your GP if you're worried about it. Your GP should be able to diagnose your type of hair loss by examining your hair. They can also discuss possible treatments with you so it's advisable to visit your GP before trying a private consultant dermatologist (skin care specialist). If you want treatment for male-pattern baldness for cosmetic reasons, two medications called finasteride and minoxidil can be used. Minoxidil can also be used to treat female-pattern baldness. However, these treatments don't work for everyone and only work for as long as they're continued. They are not available on the NHS and can be expensive. Alopecia areata is usually treated with steroid injections, although it's sometimes possible to use a steroid cream, gel or ointment. A treatment called immunotherapy may also be used. This involves stimulating hair growth by causing an intentional allergic reaction in the affected areas of skin. If you have significant hair loss of any type, you may decide to wear a wig. Wigs are available on the NHS, but you may have to pay unless you qualify for help with charges. There are also some surgical options for hair loss, including a hair transplant and artificial hair implants. Read more about treating hair loss. Emotional issues Hair loss can be difficult to come to terms with. The hair on your head can be a defining part of your identity. If you start to lose your hair, it can feel as if you're losing part of your identity. This can affect your self-confidence and sometimes lead to depression. Speak to your GP if you're finding it difficult to deal with your hair loss. They may suggest counselling. You may also benefit from joining a support group or speaking to other people in the same situation \u2013 for example, through online forums. A number of charities, such as Alopecia UK, have support groups and online forums where you can talk to others who are experiencing hair loss.

You won't be able to straighten the end of the finger because the tendon connecting the muscle to the finger bone is stretched or torn. The finger will also be painful and swollen. Sometimes a small fragment of bone breaks off with the tendon. Mallet finger is most often caused by a minor injury, such as catching the finger on clothing or bedding. It's also a common sports injury, particularly in sports where a ball or another object can strike the end of a finger. In some cases, mallet finger can be caused by a cut to the end of the finger on the side of the nail. What should I do? If you think you have mallet finger, go to your nearest minor injuries unit or accident and emergency (A&E) department to have it splinted. You should do this as soon as possible \u2013 the earlier it's treated, the better the outcome. Try to keep your hand raised until the doctor sees you. This helps to reduce any swelling and pain. Take off any rings on the affected finger, as swelling may make it difficult to remove them later or may cut off the blood supply to the finger. You can take an over-the-counter painkiller, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to relieve the pain. Once your finger is splinted, applying an ice pack a few times a day for 10 to 20 minutes may also help reduce pain and swelling. How is it treated? Your finger will be placed in a plastic splint, which keeps it straight, with the end joint slightly bent backwards. You'll still be able to bend the finger at the middle joint. Sometimes a custom splint is made by an occupational therapy team if a standard one doesn't fit well. The splint is taped on, and must be worn day and night for 6 to 12 weeks to allow the two ends of the torn tendon to stay together and heal. It should only be removed for cleaning. It's really important that the end of your finger doesn't bend during the time it's splinted, as this may slow down healing and reduce the effectiveness of the treatment. The middle joint of the finger is left free so you can continue to move it to prevent any stiffness developing. You should only need surgery if the finger bone has broken \u2013 known as a mallet fracture or bony mallet injury \u2013 or in the uncommon situation where the mallet finger fails to heal. How do I keep my finger and splint clean? The splinted finger must be kept clean and dry at all times. If the skin becomes wet inside the splint, it will become very sore. It's important to wash both your finger and the splint at least once a day, following these instructions: Keep your finger flat on the table, cut the strapping, and slide the splint off your finger. Wash and dry your finger and the splint using soap and water. Keep the end joint straight at all times by keeping your finger flat on the table. You may find it easier if someone helps you do this each day, as any movement of the end of the finger will delay the healing of the tendon, and may even cause permanent damage. Slide the splint back over the fingertip, still keeping the finger straight. Replace the strapping \u2013 this should cover the middle of the splint, but should not cover the middle joint of the finger. How long will it take to heal? Your mallet finger should heal within 6 to 12 weeks, after which time you'll be able to use the finger again. You may be advised to continue to only wear the splint at night for up to four more weeks. Sometimes you only need to see a specialist once, as a hand physiotherapist can take over your care. They'll provide you with exercises to perform at home to help prevent stiffness in the finger. Depending on your job, you may require time off work. It's important to avoid any sports involving the hands while your injury is healing. It may take several months to regain full function. Redness, swelling, and tenderness of the skin around the end of the finger are common for three or four months after injury, but usually settle eventually. Fractures involving the joint of the finger also increase the risk of arthritis in the future.

Malnutrition means \"poor nutrition\" and can refer to: undernutrition \u2013 when you don't get enough nutrients overnutrition \u2013 when you get more nutrients than you need This topic focuses on undernutrition. See obesity for more information about the main problems associated with overnutrition. Who's affected by malnutrition? Malnutrition is a common health problem. There are an estimated 3 million malnourished people in the UK at any time, with many more at risk of becoming malnourished. Around one in three people admitted to hospital or care homes in the UK are found to be malnourished or at risk of malnourishment. Malnutrition is caused by having an inadequate diet or a problem absorbing nutrients from food. There are many reasons why these might happen, including having reduced mobility, a long-term health condition, or a low income. Read more about the causes of malnutrition. Signs of malnutrition The most common symptom of undernutrition is unintentional weight loss (losing 5-10% or more of your body weight over three to six months). Other signs can include: weak muscles feeling tired all the time low mood an increase in illnesses or infections  The main sign of overnutrition is being overweight or obese. However, people with undernutrition can also be overweight if they eat a diet high in energy (calories), but low in other nutrients. Signs of malnutrition in children can include failure to grow at the expected rate and changes in behaviour, such as appearing unusually irritable, sluggish or anxious. Your child\u2019s weight and physical development should be regularly assessed by your GP when your child is young. Speak to your GP or health visitor if you have any concerns about your child\u2019s health or development. Read more about the symptoms of malnutrition. When to see your GP See your GP if your body mass index (BMI) is lower than 18.5 or you notice the above symptoms.  BMI is a measure of whether you're a healthy weight for your height. You can use the BMI healthy weight calculator to work out your BMI. You should visit your GP if you believe you or someone you care for is at risk of malnutrition. They can check for signs of malnourishment and any conditions that may cause malnutrition. Read more about diagnosing malnutrition. Treating malnutrition Depending on what's caused a person to become malnourished and how severe it is, treatment may be carried out at home or in hospital. Dietary changes are the main treatment for malnutrition. If you're undernourished, you may need to increase the nutritional content of your food, with or without taking nutritional supplements. If you're unable to eat enough to meet your nutritional needs you may need: a feeding tube to provide nutrients directly into your digestive system a drip to provide nutrients and fluids directly into a vein Read more about treating malnutrition. Preventing malnutrition The best way to prevent malnutrition is to eat a healthy, balanced diet. A healthy, balanced diet is vital for maintaining health and fitness. To stay healthy, you need to eat a variety of foods from the four main food groups including: plenty of fruit and vegetables plenty of bread, rice, potatoes, pasta and other starchy foods some milk and dairy foods some meat, fish, eggs, beans and other non dairy sources of protein The eatwell plate shows the different types of food you need to eat (and in what proportions) to maintain a well-balanced and healthy diet.

The main sign of kwashiorkor is having too much fluid in body tissues, causing swelling under the skin (oedema). It usually begins in the legs, but can involve the whole body, including the face. The following symptoms can also be present: red, inflamed patches of skin that darken and peel or split open dry, sparse, brittle hair that may turn reddish yellow or white drowsiness and tiredness irritability failure to grow loss of muscle mass an enlarged tummy ('pot belly') regular or persistent infections ridged or cracked nails If the condition is left untreated for too long, it can be fatal. Why does it happen? Kwashiorkor is most commonly seen in developing regions of the world with an unstable food supply, particularly in countries where the diet consists mainly of corn, rice and beans which lack essential nutrients such as proteins, vitamins and minerals. However, the exact cause remains unknown. The condition is unusual in developed countries such as the UK, although it can occasionally occur as a result of problems such as severe neglect, long-term (chronic) illness, a lack of knowledge about nutrition or a very restricted diet. Kwashiorkor can affect people of all ages, but is more common in children than adults. How it is diagnosed Kwashiorkor can be diagnosed based on physical appearance and knowledge about the person's diet and care. There are other conditions that may cause oedema and the other signs of kwashiorkor. Blood and urine tests may be done to exclude these and to see how kwashiorkor is affecting the body, including measuring blood sugar and protein levels, checking how well the liver and kidneys are working, checking for anaemia and measuring the levels of vitamins and minerals in the body. Other tests may include growth measurements, calculating body mass index (BMI), measuring body water content, taking a skin biopsy and analysing a hair sample. How it is treated If it is identified early, kwashiorkor can sometimes be treated with either specially formulated milk-based feeds or ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF), which is typically made up of peanut butter, milk powder, sugar, vegetable oil and added vitamins and minerals. In severe cases, or where there are already complications such as infections, more intensive treatment provided as an inpatient in a hospital or clinic will be needed. Inpatient treatment will usually involve: correcting or preventing low blood glucose keeping the person warm, as kwashiorkor can cause difficulty generating body heat treating dehydration if it is present with specially-formulated rehydration solution treating infections with antibiotics, as kwashiorkor greatly increases the risk of infections correcting vitamin and mineral deficiencies \u2013 vitamin supplements are usually included in the special milks or RUTF slowly introducing small amounts of food at first because it may upset the body\u2019s metabolism, before gradually increasing the strength and amount of food eaten to promote weight gain and growth This whole process generally takes between two and six weeks to complete. Play and stimulation are an important part of recovery from kwashiorkor, as well as ensuring nutrition and care provided at home are adequate. Outlook How well a person with kwashiorkor does after treatment depends on the severity of the condition when treatment began.  If treatment was started early, the person usually recovers well, although children may never reach their full growth potential. If treatment was started in the later stages of malnutrition, the person may be left with physical and intellectual disabilities. If kwashiorkor is not treated or treatment is delayed, it can result in death. Children with kwashiorkor often develop an enlarged 'pot belly'  Marasmus Marasmus is another type of malnutrition often found in developing regions of the world affected by an unstable food supply. The condition is generally associated with a lack of protein, calories and other nutrients in the diet and, unlike kwashiorkor, it tends to lead to significant loss of fat and muscle without any associated swelling (oedema). It's not clear exactly why some severely malnourished children develop marasmus and others develop kwashiorkor, although it is not thought to be solely due to diet because both conditions can occur in children with very similar diets. Marasmus is generally treated in the same way as kwashiorkor.

Breast screening aims to find breast cancers early. It uses an X-ray test called a mammogram that can spot cancers when they are too small to see or feel. Breast screening does, however, have some risks you should be aware of (see below). As the likelihood of getting breast cancer increases with age, all women who are aged 50-70 and registered with a GP are automatically invited for breast cancer screening every three years. In the meantime, if you are worried about breast cancer symptoms, such as a lump or area of thickened tissue in a breast, don't wait to be offered screening \u2013 see your GP. This page gives an overview of breast cancer screening, with links to information on why and when it is offered, what happens when you go for breast screening, and receiving your results. Why is breast screening offered? Most experts agree that regular breast screening is beneficial in identifying breast cancer early. The earlier the condition is found, the better the chances of surviving it. You're also less likely to need a mastectomy (breast removal) or chemotherapy if breast cancer is detected at an early stage. The main risk is that breast screening sometimes picks up cancers that may not have caused any symptoms or become life-threatening. You may end up having unnecessary extra tests and treatment. Read about the pros and cons of breast cancer screening. When will I be offered breast screening? Breast screening is currently offered to women aged 50-70 in England. However, the NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47-73. You will first be invited for screening between your 50th and 53rd birthday, although in some areas you'll be invited from the age of 47 as part of the trial extension of the programme. You may be eligible for breast screening before the age of 50 if you have a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer (for more information, read 'If you have a family history of breast cancer'). If you're over the age of 70, you'll stop receiving screening invitations. However, you're still eligible for screening and can arrange an appointment by contacting your local screening unit. For more information, read when breast cancer screening is offered. Find breast screening units in your area. What happens during breast screening? Breast screening is carried out at special clinics or mobile breast screening units. The procedure is carried out by female members of staff who take mammograms. During screening, your breasts will be X-rayed one at a time. The breast is placed on the X-ray machine and gently but firmly compressed with a clear plate. Two X-rays are taken of each breast at different angles. For more information, read what happens during breast cancer screening.  When will I receive my results? After your breasts have been X-rayed, the mammogram will be checked for any abnormalities. The results of the mammogram will be sent to you and your GP no later than two weeks after your appointment. Following screening, about one in 25 women will be called back for further assessment. Being called back doesn't mean you definitely have cancer. The first mammogram may have been unclear. About one in four women who are called back for further assessment are diagnosed with breast cancer. Read our page on understanding your results.

What is gynaecomastia? Gynaecomastia (sometimes referred to as \"man boobs\") is a common condition that causes boys\u2019 and men\u2019s breasts to swell and become larger than normal. It is most common in teenage boys and older men. What are the signs of gynaecomastia? Signs vary from a small amount of extra tissue around the nipples to more prominent breasts. It can affect one or both breasts. Sometimes, the breast tissue can be tender or painful, but this isn\u2019t always the case. What causes gynaecomastia? Gynaecomastia can have several causes. Hormone imbalance Gynaecomastia can be caused by an imbalance between the sex hormones testosterone and oestrogen. Oestrogen causes breast tissue to grow. While all men produce some oestrogen, they usually have much higher levels of testosterone, which stops the oestrogen from causing breast tissue to grow. If the balance of hormones in the body changes, this can cause a man\u2019s breasts to grow. Sometimes, the cause of this imbalance is unknown. Obesity Some growth in breast tissue is not due to extra body fat from being overweight, so losing weight or doing more exercise may not improve the condition. However, a common reason for gynaecomastia is that being very overweight (obese) can increase levels of oestrogen, which can cause breast tissue to grow. Newborn baby boys Gynaecomastia can affect newborn baby boys, because oestrogen passes through the placenta from the mother to the baby. This is temporary and will disappear a few weeks after the baby is born. Puberty During puberty, boys\u2019 hormone levels vary. If the level of testosterone drops, oestrogen can cause breast tissue to grow. Many teenage boys have some degree of breast enlargement. Gynaecomastia at puberty usually clears up as boys get older and their hormone levels become more stable. Older age As men get older, they produce less testosterone. Older men also tend to have more body fat, and this can cause more oestrogen to be produced. These changes in hormone levels can lead to excess breast tissue growth. Other causes In rare cases, gynaecomastia can be caused by: side effects of medication \u2013 such as anti-ulcer drugs or medication for heart disease illegal drugs \u2013 such as cannabis or anabolic steroids drinking too much alcohol  a health abnormality \u2013 such as kidney failure or liver disease Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome (a rare genetic disorder) lumps or infection in the testicles Treatment for gynaecomastia If you\u2019re worried about breast tissue growth, see your GP. If your GP thinks treatment is needed, there are two types of treatment for gynaecomastia: surgery to remove the excess breast tissue medication to adjust a hormone imbalance Your GP can discuss the treatment options with you. Read more about male breast reduction surgery. Procedures such as breast reduction surgery are not usually available on the NHS, unless there is a clear medical need for them. For example, if you have had gynaecomastia for a long time, it has not responded to other treatments and it is causing you a lot of distress or pain, your GP may refer you to a plastic surgeon to discuss the possibility of surgery. Always see your GP if the area is very painful or there is an obvious lump. Sometimes, the lump may need to be removed. Gynaecomastia is not related to breast cancer, but if you're worried about breast swelling, see a GP. Read the answers to more questions about men\u2019s health.

It means the body can't process certain amino acids (the \"building blocks\" of protein), causing a harmful build-up of substances in the blood and urine. Normally, our bodies break down protein foods such as meat and fish into amino acids. Any amino acids that aren't needed are usually broken down and removed from the body. Babies with MSUD are unable to break down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine. Very high levels of these amino acids are harmful. One of the characteristic symptoms of MSUD is sweet-smelling urine, which gives the condition its name. Diagnosing MSUD At around five days old, babies are offered newborn blood spot screening to check if they have MSUD. This involves pricking your baby's heel to collect drops of blood to test. If MSUD is diagnosed, treatment can be given straight away to reduce the risk of serious complications. With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, the outcome can be greatly improved. However, treatment for MSUD must be continued for life. Without treatment, severe and life-threatening symptoms can develop, including seizures (fits) or falling into a coma. Some children with untreated MSUD are also at risk of brain damage and developmental delay. Around 1 in 185,000 children worldwide are thought to be affected by the condition. Symptoms Symptoms of MSUD usually appear within the first few days or weeks after birth. More general symptoms include: sweet-smelling urine and sweat poor feeding or loss of appetite weight loss Babies with MSUD may also have episodes known as a metabolic crisis, sometimes early in their life. Symptoms of a metabolic crisis include: lack of energy vomiting irritability breathing difficulties It's important to get medical help immediately if your baby develops symptoms of a metabolic crisis. Your doctor will give you advice to help you recognise the signs. In some cases, a metabolic crisis may be triggered later in childhood by an infection or illness. The hospital will provide you with emergency treatment instructions to follow if your child is ill, which helps prevent these symptoms developing. Treating MSUD Diet Children diagnosed with MSUD are first referred to a specialist metabolic dietitian and given a low-protein diet. This is tailored to reduce the amount of amino acids your baby receives, especially leucine, valine and isoleucine. High-protein foods need to be limited, including: meat fish cheese eggs pulses nuts Your dietitian will provide detailed advice and guidance, as your baby still needs some of these foods for healthy growth and development. Some children need to take supplements of isoleucine and valine alongside the prescribed diet. This is to help maintain a healthy level of these amino acids in the blood without causing harm. Blood tests are needed to monitor these levels. Breastfeeding and baby milk also need to be monitored and measured, as advised by your dietitian. Regular baby milk contains the amino acids that need to be restricted, so a special formula is used instead. This contains all the vitamins, minerals and other amino acids your baby needs. People with MSUD need to follow a low-protein diet for the rest of their life to reduce the risk of a metabolic crisis. As your child gets older they'll eventually need to learn how to control their diet and will stay in contact with a dietitian for advice and monitoring. Emergency treatment If your baby develops an infection, such as a high temperature or cold, their risk of having a metabolic crisis increases. It's possible to reduce the risk by changing to an emergency diet while they're ill. Your dietitian will provide detailed instructions, but the aim is to replace milk and foods containing protein with special high-sugar drinks and amino acid supplements. If your baby can't keep down their emergency feeds or has repeated diarrhoea, contact the metabolic team at the hospital to let them know you're heading straight to the accident and emergency (A&E) department. You should also be given a leaflet to bring with you in the event of an emergency in case the doctors haven't seen MSUD before. Once in hospital, your baby can be monitored and treated with fluids given directly into a vein (intravenous fluids). You should also take your baby to hospital if they develop the symptoms of a metabolic crisis, such as irritability, loss of energy or breathing difficulties. Liver transplant A liver transplant is sometimes an option to treat MSUD. If a person with MSUD receives a donated liver, they'll no longer be at risk of a metabolic crisis and can have a normal diet. However, a liver transplant is a major procedure with its own risks. You will have to take medicine to suppress the immune system (immunosuppressant medication) for the rest of your life to stop your body rejecting the new liver. It's important to consider all the pros and cons before deciding whether or not to have a liver transplant. Your doctor will be able to discuss whether this is a suitable option. How MSUD is inherited The genetic change (mutation) responsible for MSUD is passed on by the parents, who usually don't have any symptoms of the condition. This is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. This means a baby needs to receive two copies of the altered genes to develop the condition \u2013 one from their mother and one from their father. If the baby only receives one mutated gene, they'll just be a carrier of MSUD. If you're a carrier of the affected genes and you have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, your baby has: a 25% chance of developing the condition a 50% chance of being a carrier of MSUD a 25% chance of receiving a pair of normal genes Although it's not possible to prevent MSUD, it's important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition. Any further children you have can be tested for the condition as soon as possible and given appropriate treatment. You may also wish to consider genetic counselling for support, information and advice about genetic conditions. Information about your child If your child has MSUD, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Children usually inherit the disorder from one of their parents. Some people are only mildly affected by Marfan syndrome, while others develop more serious symptoms. Typical characteristics of Marfan syndrome include: being tall  abnormally long and slender limbs, fingers, and toes (arachnodactyly, see photo) heart defects lens dislocation \u2013 where the lens of the eye falls into an abnormal position Read more about the symptoms of Marfan syndrome. What causes Marfan syndrome? Marfan syndrome is hereditary, which means it can be passed to a child from a parent who's affected. In around three-quarters (75%) of cases, Marfan syndrome is inherited from one parent. The syndrome is autosomal dominant, which means a child can inherit it even if only one parent has the syndrome. There's therefore a one in two (50%) chance that the child of a parent with Marfan syndrome will inherit the syndrome. The gene defect leads to abnormal production of a protein called fibrillin, resulting in parts of the body being able to stretch abnormally when placed under any kind of stress. The defective fibrillin gene also causes some bones to grow longer than they should. This means a person with Marfan syndrome may be tall because their arms and legs grow longer than normal. In the remaining quarter (25%) of cases, neither parent has the syndrome. In these cases, the fibrillin gene changes (mutates) for the first time in the parent's egg or sperm. The mutated gene can be passed on to the child, who will then go on to develop the syndrome. Read more about genetic inheritance. Diagnosing Marfan syndrome Diagnosing Marfan syndrome can be difficult as the symptoms can vary significantly from person to person. As the symptoms of Marfan syndrome don't always develop during childhood, it may not be identified until the teenage years. In 99% of cases, a genetic test can be used to confirm a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. However, it's an expensive process as the gene can mutate in more than 3,000 different ways. In most cases, a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is based on a thorough physical examination and a detailed assessment of a person's medical and family history. Read more about how Marfan syndrome is diagnosed. Treating Marfan syndrome There's no cure for Marfan syndrome, so treatment focuses on managing the symptoms and reducing the risk of complications. As Marfan syndrome affects several different parts of the body, you'll be treated by a team of different healthcare professionals. You'll be closely monitored, and any complications will be treated if they occur. One of the most serious problems caused by Marfan syndrome occur if the heart and the aorta, the body's main artery, are significantly affected. This can lead to a lower life expectancy. Read more about the possible treatments for Marfan syndrome. Information about you If you or your child has Marfan syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you\/them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. How common is Marfan syndrome? Although Marfan syndrome is rare, affecting about 1 in 3,000 people, it's one of the most common connective tissue disorders. Men and women are affected equally.

But if serious symptoms develop, such as severe pain, swelling or difficulty breathing, dial 999 for an ambulance. Fortunately, there are only a few stinging sea creatures in the seas around the UK. These are: weever fish stingrays sea urchins jellyfish Portuguese man-of-war These are described below. Weever fish Weever fish are small, sandy-coloured fish that usually lie buried in the sand on the seabed. They have poisonous spines on their back and gills that can sting you, usually on your feet or hands. Stingrays Stingrays are flat, circular or diamond-shaped fish that have a sharp, serrated barb underneath their tail. As with weever fish, most people stung by a stingray are stung on their lower legs, ankles and feet after accidentally stepping on one in shallow water. Sea urchins Sea urchins are small, round sea creatures with a bony shell covered in spines. They're usually found in the shallows, on rocks and in seaweed. Sea urchin spines are hard, sharp and can cause puncture wounds. Between the spines are small organs, containing a poison that's released as a defence mechanism. Jellyfish Jellyfish are mushroom-shaped creatures that often float near the surface and have long, thin tentacles on the underside of their bodies. The tentacles are covered with small poisonous sacs called nematocysts which, if touched, produce a nasty sting. During the warmer months in recent years, large groups of jellyfish have become increasingly common in the seas around Europe. Portuguese man-of-war A Portuguese man-of-war is a large, poisonous jellyfish-like creature (although it's not a jellyfish) with a large purple-blue, gas-filled bladder and tentacles that hang below the water. They're usually found in tropical waters, but some have been spotted in UK waters or found washed up on beaches. The sting can be painful, but rarely causes death. Signs and symptoms All stings are painful and cause swelling, inflammation or raised areas of skin (welts) and nausea. You may also have other symptoms, depending on what has stung you. Weever fish and sea urchins usually sting your foot and often leave spines in the wound. Stingrays can leave a large, jagged cut or puncture wound on your skin. Jellyfish and Portuguese men-of-war often leave raised blisters on the skin in the shape of their own tentacles. Read more about the symptoms of sea creature stings. When to seek medical help Seek medical assistance if you've been stung while in the sea and your symptoms are severe \u2013 for example: severe, prolonged pain chest pain or breathing problems severe redness and swelling around the affected area fits or seizures You should also seek medical help if you know you've been stung by a stingray, or if you've been stung on a particularly sensitive part of your body, such as your face or genitals. Less severe marine creature stings can be treated yourself using first aid techniques. Read more about how marine creature stings are treated, both at home and in hospital. Avoiding stings in the sea It's rare to be stung in the seas around the UK, but there are precautions you can take to avoid being stung, including: observing beach warning signs  not touching or handling sea creatures that sting wearing protective clothing, such as a wetsuit or waterproof footwear scuffing your feet as you walk in shallow water to warn any sea creatures that you're approaching Read more about how to prevent being stung in the sea. Healthcare abroad If you're planning a trip abroad, it's a good idea to familiarise yourself with any potentially harmful plants and animals in the countries you'll be visiting. It's also important to have the right travel insurance for the country or countries you visit. Make sure your insurance policy covers specific activities you plan to do, such as water sports or scuba diving. When travelling in Europe, a valid European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) entitles you to free or reduced-cost medical care. However, the EHIC isn't a substitute for travel insurance and doesn't provide the same level of cover \u2013 for example, an EHIC doesn't cover emergency travel back to the UK.

Breast pain may be felt as a heaviness or soreness, and has also been described as a stabbing or burning pain. It's usually felt in the upper, outer area of your breasts and may extend from your breasts to your armpits, and sometimes down your arms. Many women worry that breast pain may be a sign of a serious condition. However, breast pain by itself is not a symptom of breast cancer, and breast pain does not increase your risk of developing breast cancer. In most cases, breast pain is relatively mild, although some women experience moderate or severe pain. Severe or chronic breast pain can interfere with daily activities and lead to stress, anxiety or depression. Types of breast pain There are two types of breast pain: cyclical breast pain \u2013 the most common type of breast pain, linked to the menstrual cycle non-cyclical breast pain \u2013 pain in the breasts unrelated to the menstrual cycle Causes of breast pain Cyclical breast pain Although the exact cause of cyclical breast pain is unknown, it's thought to be linked to the changes in hormone levels before periods begin. The menstrual cycle is controlled by your body releasing hormones such as oestrogen. Hormones are powerful chemicals that have a wide range of effects on the body. The pain occurs around the same time every month, usually one to three days before the start of your period, and improves at the end of your period. The intensity of the pain will not always be the same. Although cyclical breast pain mainly affects women who are still having periods (before the menopause), some women can experience symptoms after the menopause if they undergo hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Cyclical breast pain is not associated with any other breast-related conditions. Non-cyclical breast pain In many cases, the cause of non-cyclical breast pain can't be identified. However, breast pain is sometimes caused by other conditions, including: mastitis \u2013 a condition that can be related to breastfeeding and causes the breast tissue to become painful and swollen breast lumps \u2013 there are many non-cancerous (benign) causes of breast lumps, some of which may be painful breast abscess \u2013 a painful collection of pus that forms in the breast Non-cyclical breast pain may also be the result of an injury elsewhere in the body, such as pulling a muscle in the chest, which is felt in the breast. In rare cases, non-cyclical breast pain may be caused by other medications and treatments \u2013 such as some types of antifungal medicines, antidepressants or antipsychotics \u2013 that are used to treat mental health conditions. When to see your GP Visit your GP if you notice changes to your breasts, such as: a lump or area of thickened tissue in either breast discharge from either of your nipples (which may be streaked with blood) a lump or swelling in either of your armpits a change in the size or shape of one or both of your breasts dimpling on the skin of your breasts a rash on or around your nipple a change in the appearance of your nipple \u2013 for example, it becomes sunken into your breast pain in either of your breasts or armpits that is not related to your period any symptoms of an infection in your breast, such as swelling, redness or warmth in your breast, or a high temperature (fever) You should also see your GP if you have any symptoms of pregnancy, such as a missed period. If you have breast pain alongside other symptoms, or the pain continues throughout your menstrual cycle (not only around your period), it may not be cyclical breast pain. Your GP can advise you on what the cause may be. Your GP will be able to diagnose cyclical breast pain by asking about your symptoms and your general health. They may also examine your breasts if they feel lumpy when you experience breast pain. Recording breast pain You may be asked to record your breast pain, if it's severe. Completing a breast pain chart may help to diagnose whether it's cyclical breast pain and to plan appropriate treatment. The chart will usually have a series of small boxes, with the month and date next to each one. You fill in the box for each day of the month to indicate your level of pain. This is usually done for at least two months. How is breast pain treated? Most cases of breast pain get better without treatment. Almost a third of women with cyclical breast pain find their condition gets better in around three menstrual cycles. However, for many, cyclical breast pain will return in the future. Many women find they can live with their breast pain once they feel reassured that it's not caused by breast cancer. The pain can usually be dealt with by over-the-counter painkillers and gels, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. Speak to your pharmacist for advice. If your breast pain is caused by another condition, such as a breast abscess, the pain should ease once the condition is treated. If your breast pain is affecting your quality of life, your GP may request that you keep a record of your daily pain and may refer you to a breast specialist for further treatment.

It's used to treat breast cancer in women or breast cancer in men. It can also be used to reduce the risk of cancer developing in the breast. If your GP refers you urgently because they think you have cancer, you have the right to be seen by a specialist within two weeks. Read more about NHS waiting times for treatment and why mastectomies are used. In 2012-13, just under 23,200 mastectomies were carried out in England. Preparing for a mastectomy Before having a mastectomy, you'll have the opportunity to discuss the operation with a specialist nurse or surgeon. You can discuss how the procedure might affect you both physically and emotionally. A specialist nurse can give you practical advice about bras and prostheses (bra inserts), if you need them. Your surgeon will discuss the type of mastectomy you'll have, possible complications and the option of breast reconstruction (see below). If you're currently taking any medicines, find out whether you should continue taking them before your operation. However, don't stop taking a prescribed medication unless advised to do so by a qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care. If you smoke, you may be advised to stop smoking before your operation. Smoking can increase the risk of complications during and after your operation, which may increase your recovery time. There are several different types of mastectomy. The type recommended for you will depend on factors such as how much the cancer has spread. All types of mastectomy use general anaesthetic and involve making a cut (incision) either diagonally or horizontally across your breast so that the breast tissue can be removed. Before the operation, you may need to have chemotherapy or hormone therapy to reduce the size of any tumours. Breast reconstruction After your breast has been removed, you may choose to have a breast reconstruction. This involves creating an artificial breast to replace the breast or breasts that have been removed. It's sometimes possible for a breast reconstruction to be carried out at the same time as a mastectomy, although it can be delayed until a later date if necessary. Read more about how a mastectomy is performed. After surgery Mastectomies are very safe procedures, with minimal complications. Most people make a good recovery and only need to stay in hospital for one night. However, some people will need to spend a few days in hospital. Generally, it takes three and six weeks to fully recover. During the early stages of recovery, you may have tubes coming from the wound. These are used to drain away blood and fluids to help prevent swelling or infection. Your scar and stitches will be covered with a dressing. It's common to experience pain, numbness, tingling and swelling after a mastectomy, but painkillers should provide some relief. In rare cases, more serious complications can develop following a mastectomy, including infection of the wound and delayed healing.

It's most common in breastfeeding women, usually within the first three months after giving birth. If mastitis is caused by breastfeeding, doctors may refer to it as lactation mastitis or puerperal mastitis. Non-breastfeeding women often have a type called periductal mastitis. Symptoms of mastitis Mastitis usually only affects one breast, and symptoms often develop quickly. Symptoms of mastitis can include: a red, swollen area on your breast that may feel hot and painful to touch a breast lump or area of hardness on your breast a burning pain in your breast that may be continuous or may only occur when you are breastfeeding nipple discharge, which may be white or contain streaks of blood You may also experience flu-like symptoms, such as aches, a high temperature (fever), chills and tiredness. When to seek medical advice Contact your GP as soon as possible if you think you might have mastitis. It may help to try some self-help measures before your appointment. It's important to see your GP promptly as mastitis could lead to a painful collection of pus (breast abscess), which may need to be drained surgically. Causes of mastitis In breastfeeding women, mastitis is often caused by a build-up of milk within the breast. This is known as milk stasis. Milk stasis can occur for a number of reasons, including: a baby not properly attaching to the breast during feeding a baby having problems sucking infrequent feeds or missing feeds In some cases, this build-up of milk can also become infected with bacteria. This is known as infective mastitis. In non-breastfeeding women, mastitis most often occurs when the breast becomes infected as a result of damage to the nipple, such as a cracked or sore nipple, or a nipple piercing. Read more about the causes of mastitis. Diagnosing mastitis Your GP can often diagnose mastitis based on your symptoms and an examination of your breasts. If you're breastfeeding, they may ask you to show them how you breastfeed. Try not to feel as if you're being tested or blamed \u2013 it can take time and practise to breastfeed correctly. Your GP may request a small sample of your breast milk for testing if: your symptoms are particularly severe you've had recurrent episodes of mastitis you've been given antibiotics and your condition hasn't improved This will help determine whether you have a bacterial infection and allow your GP to prescribe an effective antibiotic. If you have mastitis and aren't breastfeeding, your GP should refer you to hospital for a specialist examination and a breast scan to rule out other conditions, particularly if your symptoms haven't improved after a few days of treatment. Scans you may have include an ultrasound scan or a mammogram (X-ray of the breast). Treating mastitis Mastitis can usually be easily treated and most women make a full recovery very quickly. Self-help measures are often helpful, such as: getting plenty of rest and staying well hydrated using over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to reduce any pain or fever avoiding tight-fitting clothing \u2013 including bras \u2013 until your symptoms improve if you're breastfeeding, continuing to feed your baby and making sure they are properly attached to your breast Breastfeeding your baby when you have mastitis, even if you have an infection, won't harm your baby and can help improve your symptoms. It may also help to feed more frequently than usual, express any remaining milk after a feed, and express milk between feeds. For non-breastfeeding women with mastitis and breastfeeding women with a suspected infection, a course of antibiotic tablets will usually be prescribed to bring the infection under control. Read more about treating mastitis. Preventing mastitis Although mastitis can usually be treated easily, the condition can recur if the underlying cause isn't addressed. If you're breastfeeding, you can help reduce your risk of developing mastitis by taking steps to stop milk building up in your breasts, such as: breastfeed exclusively for around six months, if possible encourage your baby to feed frequently, particularly when your breasts feel overfull ensure your baby is well attached to your breast during feeds \u2013 ask for advice if you're unsure let your baby finish their feeds \u2013 most babies release the breast when they've finished feeding; try not to take your baby off the breast unless they're finished avoid suddenly going longer between feeds \u2013 if possible, cut down gradually avoid pressure on your breasts from tight clothing, including bras Your GP, midwife or health visitor can advise about how to improve your breastfeeding technique. You can also call the National Breastfeeding Helpline on 0300 100 0212 for advice.

There are two main types of mastocytosis: cutaneous mastocytosis, which mainly affects children \u2013 where mast cells gather in the skin, but aren't found in large numbers elsewhere in the body systemic mastocytosis, which mainly affects adults \u2013 where mast cells gather in body tissues, such as the skin, internal organs and bones There are also several subtypes of systemic mastocytosis, depending on the symptoms. This topic covers: What are mast cells? Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Complications Mast cells Mast cells are produced in the bone marrow, the spongy tissue found in the hollow centres of some bones, and live longer than normal cells. They're an important part of the immune system and help fight infection. When mast cells detect a substance that triggers an allergic reaction (an allergen), they release histamine and other chemicals into the bloodstream. Histamine makes the blood vessels expand and the surrounding skin itchy and swollen. It can also create a build-up of mucus in the airways, which become narrower. Symptoms of mastocytosis The symptoms of mastocytosis can vary depending on the type. Cutaneous mastocytosis The most common symptom of cutaneous mastocytosis is abnormal growths (lesions) on the skin, such as bumps and spots, which can form on the body and sometimes blister. Systemic mastocytosis Some people with systemic mastocytosis may experience episodes of severe symptoms that last 15-30 minutes, often with specific triggers such as physical exertion or stress. Many people don't have any problems. During an episode you may have: skin reactions \u2013 such as itching and flushing gut symptoms \u2013 such as vomiting and diarrhoea muscle and joint pain mood changes, headaches and episodes of tiredness (fatigue) There are three subtypes of systemic mastocytosis. They are: indolent mastocytosis \u2013 symptoms are usually mild to moderate and vary from person to person; indolent mastocytosis accounts for around 90% of adult systemic mastocytosis cases aggressive mastocytosis \u2013 where mast cells multiply in organs, such as the spleen, liver and digestive system; the symptoms are more wide-ranging and severe, although skin lesions are less common systematic mastocytosis with associated blood (haematological) disease \u2013 where a condition that affects the blood cells, such as chronic leukaemia, also develops Severe allergic reaction People with mastocytosis have an increased risk of developing a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction. This is known as anaphylaxis. The increased risk of anaphylaxis is caused by the abnormally high number of mast cells and their potential to release large amounts of histamine into the blood. If you or your child has mastocytosis, you may need to carry an adrenaline auto-injector, which can be used to treat the symptoms of anaphylaxis.  Read more about the symptoms of mastocytosis. Causes of mastocytosis The cause or causes of mastocytosis aren't fully known, but there's thought to be an association with a change in genes (genetic mutation) known as the KIT mutation. The KIT mutation makes the mast cells more sensitive to the effects of a signalling protein called stem cell factor (SCF). SCF plays an important role in stimulating the production and survival of certain cells, such as blood cells and mast cells, inside the bone marrow.   In a very few cases of mastocytosis it appears the KIT mutation is passed down through families (inherited). However, in most cases the mutation happens for no apparent reason (spontaneous). Diagnosing mastocytosis A physical examination of the skin is the first stage in diagnosing cutaneous mastocytosis. Your child's GP or skin specialist (dermatologist) may rub the affected areas of skin to see if they become red, inflamed and itchy. This is known as Darier's sign. It's usually possible to confirm a diagnosis by carrying out a biopsy, where a small skin sample is taken and checked for mast cells. Five tests are commonly used to look for systemic mastocytosis. They are: blood tests \u2013 including a full blood count (FBC) and measuring blood tryptase levels an ultrasound scan to look for enlargement of the liver and spleen if it seems likely a DEXA scan to measure bone density  a bone marrow biopsy test \u2013 where a local anaesthetic is used and a long needle is inserted through the skin into the one underneath, usually in the pelvis A diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis is usually made by finding typical changes on a bone marrow biopsy. Treating mastocytosis There's no cure for mastocytosis, so the aim of treatment is to try to relieve the symptoms. Treatment options will depend on the type of mastocytosis and the severity of the symptoms. Mild to moderate cases of cutaneous mastocytosis can be treated with steroid cream (topical corticosteroids) for a short time. Steroid cream reduces the number of mast cells that can release histamine and trigger swelling (inflammation) in the skin. Antihistamines can also be used to treat the symptoms of cutaneous or indolent mastocytosis, such as red skin and itchiness. Antihistamines are a type of medication that block the effects of histamine, and are often used to treat allergic conditions. Read more about treating mastocytosis. Complications of mastocytosis In children the symptoms of cutaneous mastocytosis usually improve over time, but remain stable in adults. In many cases the condition gets better on its own by the time a child has reached puberty. The outlook for systemic mastocytosis can vary, depending on the type you have. Indolent systemic mastocytosis shouldn't affect life expectancy, but other types can.  A few people develop a serious blood condition, such as chronic leukaemia, over their lifetime.

It's usually more common in children, although adults can also sometimes be affected. The mastoid bone has a honeycomb-like structure that contains air spaces called mastoid cells. The mastoid cells help maintain the air space in the middle ear. Mastoiditis can develop if the mastoid cells become infected or inflamed, often as a result of a persistent middle ear infection (otitis media). This can cause the porous bone to break down. Symptoms of mastoiditis Mastoiditis typically causes: redness, tenderness and pain behind the ear swelling behind the ear that can cause it to stick out discharge from the ear a high temperature, irritability and tiredness headache hearing loss in the affected ear When to see your GP Call your GP if you or your child: has any symptoms of mastoiditis has an ear infection that doesn't clear up with treatment or is followed by new symptoms has been diagnosed with mastoiditis and treatment hasn't cleared it up What causes mastoiditis? Mastoiditis usually occurs following an untreated middle ear infection. Bacteria from the middle ear can spread to the inner ear, infecting the mastoid cells of the mastoid bone. Cholesteatoma can also cause mastoiditis. This is an abnormal collection of skin cells inside the ear which may prevent the ear draining properly, leading to infection. How mastoiditis is diagnosed Your GP will examine the inside of the ear with an otoscope (a device with a light and magnifying glass) to check for signs of infection or cholesteatoma. Most ear infections are middle ear infections. If your GP thinks you have mastoiditis as a complication of a middle ear infection, they'll refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist. They will carry out a further examination and tests \u2013 usually a blood test and an ear culture (where discharge from the ear is tested for a bacterial infection). Some children may need to have a computerised tomography (CT scan), which uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the skull. How mastoiditis is treated Mastoiditis is a serious infection and should be treated quickly. It's treated with antibiotics. You may need to go to hospital so that you can be given antibiotics directly into a vein through a drip. In some cases, surgery may be needed to drain your middle ear (a myringotomy) or to remove part of the mastoid bone (mastoidectomy). If you're admitted to hospital for treatment you'll need to stay in for a few days until the ENT specialists can be sure the infection is under control. After surgery If you've had surgery for mastoiditis, you'll probably need to take one or two weeks off work. Your doctor will advise you about this. Take care not to get the affected ear wet. You should be able to wash your hair after about a week, providing you don't get water inside your ear. You should be able to go swimming around four to six weeks after the operation, depending on how well your ear has healed. Your doctor should be able to advise you at your follow-up appointment. Outlook With early antibiotic treatment, most people with mastoiditis recover quickly and have no complications. However, treatment isn't always easy and the infection may come back. If the mastoid bone is severely infected and isn't removed, it can cause hearing loss and life-threatening health complications such as a blood clot, meningitis, or a brain abscess.

This means that someone with MCADD can become very ill if their body's energy demands exceed their energy intake, such as during infections or vomiting illnesses when they're unable to eat. Problems occur because fat is only partially broken down, which leads to a lack of energy and a build-up of harmful substances in the body MCADD is a lifelong condition that's present from birth. It's estimated to affect up to 1 in every 8,000 babies born in the UK and is usually picked up using the newborn blood spot test. The full name for MCADD is medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. This page covers: Is MCADD serious? Symptoms of MCADD What causes MCADD? How MCADD is inherited Screening and testing for MCADD How MCADD is treated Information about you Is MCADD serious? MCADD is a potentially serious condition that can be life-threatening if not recognised quickly and treated appropriately. However, most cases are picked up soon after birth and can be managed quite easily (see How MCADD is treated below). With proper care, there's no reason why someone with MCADD cannot live a normal, healthy and active life. Symptoms of MCADD If someone with MCADD becomes unwell and is unable to eat or tolerate food, they may experience the following symptoms: appearing unusually tired and sluggish being sick excessive sweating rapid breathing seizures (fits) Left untreated, more serious and potentially life-threatening problems can develop, including coma and brain damage. You'll be given an emergency contact number to call immediately if you or your child has MCADD and experiences symptoms. If this information isn't easily available, call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department and tell them about your or your child's MCADD. What causes MCADD? MCADD is caused by a fault in the gene that provides the instructions to make an enzyme called medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). This genetic fault causes the enzyme to either not work properly or be missing entirely, which means the body cannot fully break down fat to release energy. If the body needs to break down fat quickly (for example, if you're unwell and haven't eaten for a while), energy cannot be produced quickly enough to meet the body's needs and substances created when fat is partially broken down can build up to harmful levels in the body. This can lead to serious problems if not treated quickly. How MCADD is inherited A child will only be born with MCADD if they inherit a copy of the faulty gene that causes it from both of their parents. The parents won't normally have the condition themselves because they usually only have one copy of the faulty gene each. This is known as being a \"carrier\". It's estimated that up to 1 in every 40 people in the UK could be carriers of the faulty gene that causes MCADD. If both parents are carriers of the faulty gene, there's a: 25% chance each child they have will not inherit any faulty genes and won't have MCADD or be able to pass it on 50% chance each child they have will just inherit a copy of the faulty gene from one parent and be a carrier 25% chance each child they have will inherit copies of the faulty gene from both parents and will have MCADD Read more about genetic inheritance. Screening and testing for MCADD A newborn blood spot test is now offered to all babies in England to help detect problems, including MCADD early on.  When your baby is five to eight days old, a health professional will prick their heel and collect drops of blood on a special card. The blood is then sent to a laboratory to be checked for abnormalities that could indicate MCADD. You should receive the results by the time your baby is six to eight weeks old. You'll be contacted sooner if a problem is found in order to attend a hospital appointment to discuss this further. The screening result isn't 100% accurate, so further urine and blood tests will be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. You, your partner and any other children you have may also be tested to see if you carry the faulty gene that causes MCADD. If you've previously had a child with MCADD, the blood spot test should be carried out within 24-48 hours of birth. How MCADD is treated There's no specific treatment for MCADD. A specialist care team will give you advice about how to look after your child and support them as they get older. Children and adults with MCADD can eat a normal diet, as long as they: frequently take special high energy drinks when they're ill \u2013 this includes common illnesses such as fever, diarrhoea, or vomiting avoid long periods without eating during the newborn period and infancy even when well \u2013 the length of time your child can go without eating is known as the maximum \"safe fasting time\" and it varies depending on age; you'll be given advice about this The high energy drinks used in treating MCADD are available on prescription from your GP. You'll be advised by a specialist dietitian about when to use them and how much to use. If the drinks don't help or your child refuses them, they may need to be treated in hospital. You can find more detailed information about MCADD treatment in the MCADD information sheet for parents and carers (PDF, 116kb) produced by the British Inherited Metabolic Diseases Group (BIMDG). Information about you If you or your child have MCADD, your clinical team will pass information about you\/them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Support groups In addition to the support of your care team, you may find it useful to contact a national or local support group for people with MCADD and their families. One the main groups in the UK is Climb. You can find information about MCADD on its website and you can speak to their Family Advisers for free on 0800 652 3181.

There's some debate over the correct term to use for the condition, but these pages will refer to the condition as CFS. CFS is a serious condition that can cause long-term illness and disability, but many people \u2013 particularly children and young people \u2013 improve over time. Who is affected? It's estimated around 250,000 people in the UK have CFS. Anyone can get the condition, although it's more common in women than men. It usually develops when people are in their early 20s to mid-40s. Children can also be affected, usually between the ages of 13 and 15.  How it affects quality of life Most cases of CFS are mild or moderate, but up to one in four people with CFS have severe symptoms. These are defined as follows:  mild \u2013 you're able to care for yourself, but may need days off work to rest moderate \u2013 you may have reduced mobility, and your symptoms can vary; you may also have disturbed sleep patterns and need to sleep in the afternoon severe \u2013 you're able to carry out minimal daily tasks, such as brushing your teeth, but have significantly reduced mobility, and may also have difficulty concentrating Read more about the symptoms of CFS. Why it happens It's not known exactly what causes CFS. Various theories have been suggested, including: a viral or bacterial infection problems with the immune system an imbalance of hormones psychiatric problems, such as stress and emotional trauma Some people are thought to be more susceptible to the condition because of their genes, as the condition is more common in some families. More research is needed to confirm exactly what causes the condition. Read more about the causes of CFS. How it is diagnosed There are specific guidelines issued by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) about the diagnosis and management of CFS. NICE says a diagnosis of CFS should be considered if you meet specific criteria regarding your fatigue \u2013 for example, it can't be explained by other conditions \u2013 and if you also have other symptoms, such as sleeping problems or problems thinking and concentrating. The diagnosis can then be confirmed if these symptoms are experienced for several months. Read more about diagnosing CFS. How it is treated Treatment for CFS may be able to reduce the symptoms. Everyone with CFS responds to treatment differently, so your treatment plan will be tailored to you. Some of the main treatments include: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) a structured exercise programme called graded exercise therapy medication to control pain, nausea and sleeping problems Most people with CFS improve over time, although some people don't make a full recovery. It's also likely there will be periods when symptoms get better or worse. Children and young people with CFS are more likely to recover fully. Read more about treating CFS. Different terms for the condition chronic fatigue syndrome \u2013 often used and preferred by doctors as there's little evidence of brain and spinal cord inflammation, which the term ME suggests; ME is also thought to be too specific to cover all the symptoms of the condition myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) \u2013 preferred by those who feel CFS is not specific enough and doesn't reflect the severity and different types of fatigue, and implies that fatigue is the only symptom (myalgic encephalopathy is sometimes also used) systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID) \u2013 a new term suggested in a 2015 report by the US Institute of Medicine, which implies that the condition affects many systems in the body (systemic); the word \"disease\" highlights the serious nature of the condition in some people Page last reviewed: 25\/02\/2015 Next review due: 25\/02\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Anyone can get measles if they haven't been vaccinated or they haven't had it before, although it's most common in young children. The infection usually clears in around 7 to 10 days. Symptoms of measles The initial symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you're infected. These can include: cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40C (104F) small greyish-white spots on the inside of the cheeks A few days later, a red-brown blotchy rash will appear. This usually starts on the head or upper neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body. Read more about the symptoms of measles. When to see your GP You should contact your GP as soon as possible if you suspect that you or your child may have measles. It's best to phone before your visit as your GP surgery may need to make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others. You should also see your GP if you've been in close contact with someone who has measles and you've not been fully vaccinated (had two doses of the MMR vaccine) or haven't had the infection before \u2013 even if you don't have any symptoms. Is measles serious? Measles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems. Once you've had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus and it's highly unlikely you'll get it again. However, measles can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (encephalitis). Read more about the complications of measles. How measles is spread The measles virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can easily catch measles by breathing in these droplets or, if the droplets have settled on a surface, by touching the surface and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth. The virus can survive on surfaces for a few hours. People with measles are infectious from when the symptoms develop until about four days after the rash first appears. How measles can be prevented Measles can be prevented by having the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. This is given in two doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. The first dose is given when your child is around 13 months old and a second dose is given before your child starts school. Adults and older children can be vaccinated at any age if they haven't been fully vaccinated before. Ask your GP about having the vaccination. If the MMR vaccine isn't suitable for you, a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) can be used if you're at immediate risk of catching measles. Read more about preventing measles. Treating measles There are several things you can do to help relieve your symptoms and reduce the risk of spreading the infection, including: taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve fever, aches and pains \u2013 aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years old drinking plenty of water to avoid dehydration closing the curtains to help reduce light sensitivity using damp cotton wool to clean the eyes staying off school or work for at least four days from when the rash first appears In severe cases, especially if there are complications, you or your child may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. Read more about treating measles. How common is measles? The effectiveness of the MMR vaccine means that cases of measles are uncommon in the UK nowadays. However, the number of cases has risen in recent years and there have been some high-profile outbreaks. For example, between November 2012 and July 2013 there was an outbreak in and around Swansea, during which more than 1,200 cases were reported. It's thought the rise in the number of cases of measles is the result of parents not getting their child vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, probably because of speculation linking MMR to autism. Publicity in 1998 highlighted a report claiming there was a link between the MMR jab and autism. However, numerous studies undertaken to investigate this claim found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

The full course of MMR vaccination requires two doses. Measles, mumps and rubella are highly infectious conditions that can have serious, and potentially fatal, complications, including meningitis, swelling of the brain (encephalitis) and deafness. They can also lead to complications in pregnancy that affect the unborn baby, and can lead to miscarriage.  Since the MMR vaccine was introduced in 1988, it's rare for children in the UK to develop these serious conditions. However, outbreaks happen and there have been cases of measles in recent years, so it's important to ensure that you and your children are up-to-date with the MMR vaccination. This NHS leaflet tells you about MMR vaccination. MMR vaccine for babies and preschoolers The MMR vaccine is given on the NHS as a single injection to babies as part of their routine vaccination schedule, usually within a month of their first birthday. They will then have a second injection of the vaccine before starting school, usually at three years and four months. The MMR vaccine can sometimes be given to babies from six months of age if they may have been exposed to the measles virus, or during a measles outbreak.   Babies under six months old are not routinely given the MMR vaccine. This is because the antibodies to measles, mumps and rubella passed from mother to baby at the time of birth are retained and can work against the vaccine, meaning that the vaccine is not usually effective. These maternal antibodies decline with age and are almost all gone by the time MMR is normally given \u2013 around the age of one. MMR vaccination is recommended for six- to nine-month-old babies if they are at high risk of becoming infected in certain circumstances, such as during a measles outbreak. However, these children may not have enough protection from this early dose, so they will still need the standard MMR doses at 12-13 months and 40 months of age. The MMR vaccine is given as a single injection into the muscle of the thigh or upper arm. Find out which children and adults should have the MMR vaccine. Watch these healthtalk.org videos where parents weigh up the risks and benefits of MMR vaccination. MMR for older children Children up to the age of 18 who missed, or only partially completed, their earlier MMR vaccination can have a \"catch-up\" MMR vaccination on the NHS.   If you know or suspect your child hasn't been fully immunised, arrange with your GP for them to have a catch-up MMR vaccination. MMR for women planning pregnancy If you're thinking about getting pregnant, it's a good idea to check that you are fully protected against measles, mumps and rubella. Rubella infection in pregnancy can lead to serious birth defects and miscarriage. If you're not sure whether you've had two doses of the MMR vaccine, ask your GP practice to check.  If you haven't had both doses or there's no record available, you can have the vaccinations at your GP practice. You should avoid becoming pregnant for one month after having MMR vaccination. Be aware that the MMR vaccine is not suitable for women who are already pregnant. MMR for non-immune adults The MMR vaccine can also be given on the NHS to adults who may need it, including people born from 1970-79 who may have only been vaccinated against measles, as well as those born from 1980-90 who may not be protected against mumps. Check with your GP if you're not sure whether you've had the MMR vaccine. If in doubt, go ahead and have it. Even if you've had it before, it won't harm you to have a second, or even third, course of the vaccination. Read more about when the MMR vaccine is needed. Find out why some teenagers should have the MMR vaccination. Get advice on how to protect yourself and your family if there's a measles outbreak. Read the NHS leaflet: measles not just a kids' problem (PDF, 868kb) How the MMR vaccine works The MMR vaccine contains weakened versions of live measles, mumps and rubella viruses. The vaccine works by triggering the immune system to produce antibodies against measles, mumps and rubella. If you or your child then comes into contact with one of the diseases, the immune system will recognise it and immediately produce the antibodies needed to fight it. It's not possible for people who have recently had the MMR vaccine to infect other people. The MMR vaccine given in the UK is known under the brand names Priorix, or M-M-RVAXPRO. Read the patient information leaflet for Priorix (PDF, 124kb). Read the patient information leaflet for M-M-RVAXPRO (PDF, 104kb). Does the MMR vaccine cause autism? There has been some controversy about whether the MMR vaccine might cause autism, following a 1998 study by Dr Andrew Wakefield. In his paper, published in The Lancet, Dr Wakefield claimed there is a link between the MMR vaccine and autism or bowel disease. However, Andrew Wakefield's work has since been completely discredited and he has been struck off as a doctor in the UK. Subsequent studies in the last eight years have found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism or bowel disease. Watch healthtalk.org videos where parents discuss their worries about the MMR vaccine. Single measles, mumps and rubella vaccines Single vaccines are not available on the NHS in the UK because there is a risk that fewer children would receive all the necessary injections, increasing the levels of measles, mumps and rubella in the country. The delay in having six separate injections would also put more children at risk of developing the conditions, as well as increasing the amount of work and inconvenience for parents and those administering the vaccines.  Side effects of the MMR vaccine As there are three separate vaccines within a single injection, different side effects can occur at different times. The side effects of the MMR vaccine are usually mild. It's important to remember that they're milder than the potential complications of measles, mumps and rubella. Side effects include: developing a mild form of measles that lasts for two to three days \u2013 this is not infectious  developing a mild form of mumps that lasts for a day or two \u2013 this is not infectious In rare cases, a small rash of bruise-like spots may appear a few weeks after the injection. See your GP if you notice this kind of rash, or if you have any concerns about your child's symptoms after having the MMR jab. Find out how the MMR jab is given. This NHS leaflet tells you about the common vaccination reactions in babies and young children up to the age of five years. Read the answers to other common questions about the MMR vaccine.

The shin pain can be felt during or after strenuous activity, particularly running, or sports with sudden stops and starts, such as basketball and tennis. The pain is felt along the shin bone (tibia), which runs down the inner part of your shin. At first you will feel a dull, aching pain. If you ignore it and continue to exercise, it can become very painful and you may have to stop exercising altogether. It's really important not to \"run through the pain\" because shin pain could be a sign of an injury to the bone and surrounding tissues in your leg. Continued force on your legs will make the injury and your pain worse. If possible, stop doing the activity which causes the problem for at least two weeks. You can still exercise during this time, but choose activities that don't put too much force on your shins, such as cycling, swimming, cross-training or yoga. Why shin splints happen Shin splints have a number of different causes. You're at risk of getting shin splints if you: have been running for less than five years run on hard surfaces or slopes wear poorly fitting or worn-out trainers that don't cushion and support your feet properly are overweight, as this places extra stress on your legs have flat feet or your feet roll inwards, as this puts more pressure on your lower legs have weak ankles or a tight Achilles tendon (the band of tissue connecting the heel bone to the calf muscle) have tight calf muscles Medial stress syndrome The most common cause of shin splints is medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS). MTSS is the result of frequent and intense periods of exercise when your body isn't used to it. Long-distance running and sports involving a lot of stopping and starting, such as basketball and tennis, increase your risk of getting MTSS. Suddenly increasing the distance and\/or pace you run are also common causes. These activities place a considerable amount of pressure on your legs, particularly if they are carried out on hard ground, and can cause injury to the bone and surrounding tissues. MTSS is thought to occur when the layer of connective tissue covering the surface of the shin bone (periosteum) becomes inflamed. It can become inflamed if too much pressure is placed on your shins, or if your foot rolls excessively when it hits the ground. This is known as over-pronation and it puts abnormal forces through the tibia and the shin bone. The pain is usually felt in both shins and it can take several days, or even weeks, for the pain to decrease once you stop the activity. Self care You should stop the activity causing your shin splints for at least two weeks. After this time, the pain in your shins should begin to decrease and you can gradually resume the activity (see below). While you're resting your legs, you can continue to do low impact activities, such as cross-training, cycling or swimming. Pool running is also a good way of maintaining cardiovascular fitness. Pain relief Pain and swelling can be relieved by holding an ice pack against your shins (a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel works well). Do this for 10 minutes every two to three hours for the first two days. You can also use over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, to help relieve the pain and inflammation. Stretching your calf muscles and the front of your leg can also help. Choosing the right shoes It's important your running shoes give you the right amount of cushioning and support for your weight and foot type. If your foot rolls inwards, you may need to have orthotics (rigid shoe inserts) fitted. Go to a specialist running shop if you are buying running shoes for the first time. A trained member of staff will be able to carry out a number of tests, including a gait analysis, and advise which shoes are best for you. If you continue having problems with your shoes, a podiatrist can give a more expert opinion and look at your overall lower limb biomechanics. Podiatrists specialise in diagnosing and treating foot problems. Find a podiatrist in your area. When to visit your GP See your GP if the pain does not improve. They will investigate other possible causes, such as: reduced blood supply to the lower leg, particularly if you smoke  tiny cracks in the shin bone (stress fractures), which usually, but not always, give pain in only one leg a leg muscle bulging out of place (muscle hernia) swelling of the leg muscle that compresses nearby nerves and blood vessels, known as compartment syndrome (see below)  a nerve problem in your lower back (radiculopathy) The pain of compartment syndrome is usually felt in both legs and only comes on with exercise. It can be felt in the front, side or back of the leg and, sometimes, in all three. Unlike the pain of MTSS, the pain caused by compartment syndrome quickly subsides when exercise ceases. Seek immediate medical assistance if: the pain is severe and follows a fall or accident your shins are hot and inflamed the swelling gets worse the pain persists during rest Your GP may refer you for physiotherapy, or you may be able to refer yourself. You could also opt to see a physiotherapist privately. Read more about accessing physiotherapy. The physiotherapist can assess your injury, show you some exercises and advise a suitable programme of rehabilitation. Alternatively, your GP may refer you to a consultant orthopaedic surgeon with a foot and ankle interest, or a consultant in sport and exercise medicine. These doctors are trained in assessing and treating sport-related problems. Getting back to your normal exercise programme You can return to your usual activity after at least two weeks of rest, and only after the pain has gone. Increase your activity level gradually, building up the time you spend running or doing sports. Run on a flat, soft surface, such as a recreation ground or playing field. Keep the distance and intensity of your run to 50% of what it was before the injury. Stop immediately if the pain returns. Gradually, over a period of three to six weeks, you can increase the distance you run. After six weeks, you can gradually start to increase your pace. Make sure you warm up properly before starting to exercise and, afterwards, take time to cool down. Learn how to warm up before exercising and how to stretch after exercising. Preventing shin splints returning You can avoid shin splints in the future by: wearing running shoes with the correct level of cushioning and support using orthotics (supportive insoles) if you over-pronate or have flat feet (running shop staff or a podiatrist will be able to advise you further about this) avoid training on hard surfaces whenever possible build up your activity level gradually improving your overall strength and flexibility Page last reviewed: 16\/12\/2014 Next review due: 16\/12\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Usually, these sensations develop gradually and start off being worse during the night. They tend to affect the thumb, index finger and middle finger. Other symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include: pins and needles (paraesthesia) thumb weakness a dull ache in the hand or arm Read more about the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). What causes carpal tunnel syndrome? Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of one of the nerves that controls sensation and movement in the hands (median nerve). The carpal tunnel is a narrow passage in your wrist made up of small bones and a tough band of tissue that acts as a pulley for the tendons that bend the fingers. It isn't known why the median nerve becomes compressed in most cases, although certain things are thought to increase the risk of CTS developing, such as: a family history of CTS pregnancy \u2013 up to about 50% of pregnant women develop CTS injuries to the wrist other health conditions, such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis strenuous, repetitive work with the hand Read more about the causes of carpal tunnel syndrome. Treating carpal tunnel syndrome In some cases CTS will disappear without treatment, or simple self-care measures will reduce the symptoms. CTS in pregnant women often gets better within three months of the baby being born, although it may need treatment. In some women, symptoms can continue for more than a year. Non-surgical treatments, such as wrist splints and corticosteroid injections, are used to treat mild or moderate symptoms. Surgery may be required if non-surgical treatments fails to relieve the symptoms. It may also be used if there is a risk of permanent nerve damage. Read more about treating carpal tunnel syndrome. Surgery relieves the symptoms of mild CTS immediately. But in those with severe nerve damage, it can take a while to recover or there may not be any improvement. Depending on which hand was operated on and what your job involves, you will usually be able to return to work within a few weeks of surgery.

How do I take part in a clinical trial? Why join a clinical trial? Will I get paid? What happens in a clinical trial? What should I know before I sign up? How are trials regulated and judged ethical? How are trial results used to improve treatment? Where can I find results from trials that are relevant to me?  How do I take part in a clinical trial? You can ask your doctor or a patient organisation if they know of any clinical trials that you may be eligible to join. You can also search for information on a number of websites and register your interest in taking part in research. The main ones are described below. UK Clinical Trials Gateway The UK Clinical Trials Gateway (UKCTG) website pulls through information about clinical trials and other research from several different UK registers. If you sign up to it, researchers can contact you about research that might be suitable for you.  You can also search the UKCTG site in various ways to find trials relevant to you, and you can contact researchers yourself. WHO International Clinical Trials The World Health Organization's Clinical Trials Search Portal provides access to clinical trials in countries all around the world. Charities For some conditions, you can find out about clinical trials from the websites of charities. Examples are: Arthritis Research UK: current clinical trials and studies Cancer Research UK: find a clinical trial   Multiple Sclerosis Society: MS clinical trials     Target Ovarian Cancer: clinical trials information centre Why join a clinical trial? Clinical trials help doctors understand how to treat a particular disease or condition. It may benefit you, or others like you, in the future. If you take part in a clinical trial, you may be one of the first people to benefit from a new treatment. However, there is also a chance that the new treatment turns out to be no better, or worse, than the standard treatment. To hear other people's experiences of taking part in a clinical trial, visit healthtalk.org: clinical trials. Will I get paid? Some clinical trials offer payment, which can vary from hundreds to thousands of pounds depending on what is involved and expected from you. Some trials don't offer payment and just cover your travel expenses. It's important to find out about the inconvenience and risks involved before you sign up, and to carefully weigh up whether it is worth it. Bear in mind: it can be time consuming \u2013 you may be expected to attend a number of screening and follow-up sessions, and some trials require you to stay overnight there may be restrictions on what you can and cannot do \u2013 for example, you may be asked to not eat or drink alcohol for a period of time you may experience unknown side effects from the treatment What happens in a clinical trial? Testing a new medicine All clinical trials of new medicines go through a series of phases to test whether they are safe and whether they work. The medicines will usually be tested against another treatment called a control. This will either be a dummy treatment (a placebo) or a standard treatment already in use. Learn more about the placebo effect. Phase one trials: A small number of people, who may be healthy volunteers, are given the medicine. The drug is being trialled in human volunteers for the first time. Researchers test for side effects and calculate what the right dose might be to use in treatment. Researchers start with small doses and only increase the dose if the volunteers don't experience any side effects, or if they only experience minor side effects. Phase two trials: The new medicine is tested on a larger group of people who are ill. This is to get a better idea of its effects in the short term. Phase three trials: Carried out on medicines that have passed phases one and two. The medicine is tested in larger groups of people who are ill, and compared against an existing treatment or a placebo to see if it's better in practice and if it has important side effects. Trials often last a year or more and involve several thousand patients. Phase four trials: The safety, side effects and effectiveness of the medicine continue to be studied while it is being used in practice. Not required for every medicine. Only carried out on medicines that have passed all the previous stages and have been given marketing licences \u2013 a licence means the medicine can be made available on prescription. Control groups, randomisation and blinding If you take part in a clinical trial, you will usually be randomly assigned to either the: treatment group \u2013 where you'll be given the treatment being assessed, or  control group \u2013 where you'll be given an existing standard treatment, or a placebo if no proven standard treatment exists While the treatments are different in the two groups, researchers try to keep as many of the other conditions the same as possible. For example, both groups should have people of a similar age, with a similar proportion of men and women, who are in similar overall health. In most trials, a computer will be used to randomly decide which group each patient will be allocated to. Many trials are set up so nobody knows who's been allocated to receive which treatment. This is known as blinding, and it helps reduce the effects of bias when comparing the outcomes of the treatments. What should I know before I sign up? When you express interest in a trial, a doctor or nurse is likely to tell you something about it in person. You'll also be given some printed information to take away. You may come back with some questions you feel haven't been answered. General questions What is the aim of the trial and how will it help people? Who is funding the trial? What treatment will I get if I do not take part in the trial? How long is the trial expected to last, and how long will I have to take part? How long will it be before the results of the trial are known? What will happen if I stop the trial treatment or leave the trial before it ends? What would happen if something went wrong? It's rare for patients to be harmed by trial treatments, but you may want to ask about compensation if this were to happen. Practical questions How much of my time will be needed? Will I need to take time off work? Will I be paid? Will the costs of my travel to take part in the trial be covered? If the trial is testing a new drug, will I have to collect it from the hospital, will it be sent to me by post, or will I get it through my doctor? Will I have to complete questionnaires or keep a diary? What are the possible side effects of my treatment? How could the treatments affect me physically and emotionally? Who can I contact if I have a problem? Will someone be available 24 hours a day? How do I find out the results of the trial? Things to weigh up As with any treatment, you can't be sure of the outcome. You may be given a new treatment that turns out not to be as effective as the standard treatment. Also, it's possible you'll experience unexpected side effects. And bear in mind that you may have to visit your place of treatment more often, or have more tests, treatments or monitoring, than you would if you were receiving the standard treatment in usual care. Leaving a trial You may decide to stop taking part in a trial if your condition is getting worse or if you feel the treatment isn't helping you. You can also choose to leave at any point without giving a reason and without it affecting the care you receive. Results At the end of the trial, the researchers should publish the results and make them available to anyone who took part and wanted to know the results. If the researchers don't offer you the results and you want to know, ask for them. Some research funders, such as the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), have websites where they publish the results of the research they have supported. How are trials regulated and judged ethical? Role of the MHRA Before a clinical trial of a new medicine can begin, a government agency called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) needs to review and authorise it. The MHRA inspects sites where trials take place to make sure they're conducted in line with good clinical practice. Role of the HRA The Health Research Authority (HRA) works to protect and promote the interests of patients and the public in health research. It is responsible for research ethics committees up and down the country.  All medical research involving people in the UK, whether in the NHS or the private sector, first has to be approved by an independent research ethics committee. The committee protects the rights and interests of the people who will be in the trial. How are trial results used to improve treatment? Clinical trials can help: prevent illnesses by testing a vaccine detect or diagnose illnesses by testing a scan or blood test treat illnesses by testing new or existing medicines find out how best to provide psychological support  find out how people can control their symptoms or improve their quality of life \u2013 for example, by testing how a particular diet affects a condition Many clinical trials are designed to show whether new medicines work as expected. These results are sent to the MHRA, which decides whether to allow the company making the medicine to market it for a particular use. Licensing a treatment If research has identified a new medicine, the MHRA must license it before it can be marketed. Licensing shows a treatment has met certain standards of safety and effectiveness. Safety must be monitored carefully over the first few years of a newly licensed treatment. This is because rare side effects that weren't obvious in clinical trials may show up for the first time. In England and Wales, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) decides whether the NHS should provide treatments. Where can I find results from trials that are relevant to me? The results of clinical trials are usually published in specialist medical journals and online libraries of evidence. Some of the most well-known examples are: The Lancet medical journal British Medical Journal (BMJ) The New England Journal of Medicine Cochrane Library \u2013 a collection of high-quality evidence NHS Evidence database You can use a search engine such as Google to look for articles and read summaries (abstracts). But you can't usually see the full articles without a subscription to the journal. Also, research papers are not written in plain English and often use many medical, scientific and statistical terms. They can be very difficult to understand. Coverage in newspapers You'll often see stories about research findings in mainstream media. But while news stories are easier to read than original research papers, sometimes the findings are exaggerated or sensationalised. The NHS website aims to make this clearer for you. Behind the Headlines is an independent service that analyses health stories that make the news.  It aims to explain the facts behind the headlines and give a better understanding of the research that was carried out.

They are sometimes termed \"medically unexplained symptoms\" or \"functional\" symptoms when they last for more than a few weeks, but doctors can't find any disease or problem with the body that may be the cause. This doesn't mean that the symptoms are faked or \"all in the head\" \u2013 they are real and can affect your ability to function properly. Not understanding the cause can make them even more distressing and difficult to cope with. Medically unexplained symptoms are surprisingly common, accounting for up to a fifth of all GP consultations in the UK. Why do they happen? Many people suffering from medically unexplained symptoms such as exhaustion (fatigue), pain and heart palpitations also have depression or anxiety disorders. Treating an associated psychological problem can often relieve the physical symptoms. For others, the symptoms may be part of a poorly understood syndrome, such as: chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) \u2013 also known as ME, which causes persistent fatigue irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \u2013 a common condition affecting the digestive system, which can cause stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and\/or constipation fibromyalgia \u2013 which causes pain all over the body A psychological or life problem may play a role in these syndromes as well \u2013 for example, IBS symptoms can be brought on by stress in some people, and managing the stress can help to relieve the symptoms. However, there may be other triggers (for example, IBS and CFS can occur after infections). Sometimes, there is simply no explanation and doctors can't diagnose a cause. This isn't unusual in medicine and doesn't mean that nothing can be done to help you (see \"How can my GP help?\" below). If you're worried that you have an underlying disease that has been missed by your doctor, you can ask for a second opinion. What sort of complaints can be 'unexplained'? Medically unexplained symptoms tend to be quite general problems, such as: fatigue  pain headaches heart palpitations  shortness of breath dizziness and feeling sick  These are often experienced alongside depression and\/or anxiety (see \"What's the connection between mental and physical health?\" below). The symptoms vary in how much they affect people \u2013 some will see their GP with relatively minor symptoms, while others may become disabled by them. Who is more likely to have them? Unexplained symptoms are reported to be more common among: women younger people those who have recently had an infection or physical illness, or those affected by the ill health or death of a relative those who have previously experienced problems such as depression and anxiety  Women are more likely than men to see their GP with symptoms, and some older people don't like to bother their GP. What's the connection between physical and mental health? Just as poor physical health can lead to unhappiness and psychological problems, the opposite is also true. Conditions such as low back pain and IBS are known to be triggered or made worse by psychological problems such as stress, anxiety or depression. This can lead to a vicious circle \u2013 for example, the emotional upset from being in constant physical pain can lead to depression, the depression then worsens the pain, and may trigger other symptoms. How can my GP help?  Your GP will aim to rule out all the possible serious causes of your symptoms. You'll probably have a thorough physical examination and blood tests. It's important to consider whether the cause of your symptoms may be any medication you are taking. Your GP should also investigate whether you might have an associated problem, such as depression or anxiety, that may be causing or worsening your symptoms. You should tell them: what the symptoms are like, when they started and what makes them better or worse what you think or fear is the cause of your symptoms and your expectations of tests and treatments how the symptoms affect what you can do  how upsetting the symptoms are There are then a number of things you can do that may help. You and your GP may need to draw up a personal health plan \u2013 this means agreeing some lifestyle changes and goals that you both think will help your symptoms. You may be referred for a talking therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT aims to help you manage your symptoms by enabling you to understand links between your symptoms, worries, feelings and behaviour. Medication such as antidepressants can be helpful, even if you're not depressed. However, drugs aren't always the answer \u2013 painkillers or sedatives, for example, may lead to dependence. The possible benefits of medication always need to be weighed against the potential side effects. If you feel your GP isn't taking your complaint seriously, you can get a second opinion. What can I do myself to improve my symptoms?  There are things you can do yourself that can improve or even relieve some physical symptoms, such as regular exercise and stress management. Regular exercise \u2013 say, three 20-minute sessions a week \u2013 will at least keep you fit and give you a chance to take a break from other tasks, or just to get out of the house. Many people find that it also boosts their mood (read about exercise for depression). The exact amount of exercise or activity needs to match your current health and capabilities. Managing stress is very important, as this has been linked to problems such as pain and IBS. Learn some relaxation tips to relieve stress. Generally, it should help to plan some pleasurable personal time to unwind \u2013 whatever helps you relax, whether it's yoga classes, meditation or walks in the countryside.  Read five steps to mental wellbeing. Your body has a remarkable ability to recover and there's a good chance that your symptoms will get better in time, even without any specific treatment.  Page last reviewed: 29\/12\/2014 Next review due: 29\/12\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Alternative forms of the medicine are sometimes available, or you may just need to experiment with some simple swallowing techniques. This page gives some basic advice and outlines the clinical and legal issues around crushing tablets or opening capsules. This advice applies to: adults who have difficulty swallowing pills parents of children who struggle to swallow pills nurses or carers of people with dysphagia (swallowing problems) Finding an alternative form If you or the person you care for finds it difficult to swallow tablets or capsules, you can ask your GP or pharmacist if there's an alternative form of the medicine. The Swallowing Difficulties website and the British National Formulary (BNF) may also have details of possible alternatives. Your pills may also be available in one of the following forms: a liquid \u2013 particularly useful for people with dysphagia who rely on a feeding tube a dispersible \u2013 tablet that disintegrates in water a buccal \u2013 tablet that dissolves when held between cheek and gum a patch a suppository \u2013 inserted into the bottom or vagina  a cream an inhaled version Seek the advice of a doctor or pharmacist if you feel unsure about giving medicine \u2013 for example, if you're not sure how to give liquid medicine through a feeding tube. Crushing tablets or opening capsules You can ask your GP or pharmacist if your tablets can be crushed, or your capsules opened and dispersed in water, before taking them. Only certain tablets or capsules can be given this way. The following preparations should never be crushed without seeking professional advice first: CR or CRT (controlled release, or controlled release tablet) LA (long-acting) SR (sustained release) TR (time release) TD (time delay) SA (sustained action) XL (extended release) These medications are designed to be released over a predetermined period of time \u2013 for example, 12-24 hours. Generally, when crushing a tablet or opening a capsule, the dose is released over 5-10 minutes, resulting in an initial overdose (and a higher chance of side effects), followed by a period without medication. Legal issues A nurse or carer of someone with dysphagia shouldn't alter the form of a medicine by crushing or opening it, unless they've been instructed to do so by a doctor. If you crush or open the medicine to give to another person, you're administering it in an unlicensed form. If you haven't consulted a doctor about it, this would render you personally liable for any harm caused, and you would have to justify your actions in the event of an adverse reaction. The Swallowing Difficulties website has more information about the legal consequences of tablet crushing. 10 tips for swallowing pills 1. Moisten your mouth with saliva or water beforehand (a dry mouth makes swallowing harder). 2. Place the pill in the centre of your tongue, and lengthways along your tongue if the pill is oval-shaped. 3. Immediately take a sip of water and wash the pill directly into your throat, throwing your head back.   4. Hold water in your mouth before inserting the pill \u2013 suspending the pill in water may help to flush it down. 5. Try using a straw to drink the water (the suction may help). 6. Taking a deep breath may help suppress your gag reflex.  7. Try chewing some food before placing the pill in your mouth, and swallow the food and pill together. 8. Insert the pill into a small piece of bread or marshmallow. 9. After swallowing the pill, follow it up with food to help it go down. 10. Try putting your chin to your chest when swallowing \u2013 this will open up your windpipe and may be better for you than throwing your head back. NB: These tips are based on common sense, rather than scientific evidence, and may not work for everyone.

How can you get medicines? Some medicines are available from pharmacists or supermarkets, while others require a prescription from your GP or another healthcare professional. The availability of medicines depends on the level of supervision experts believe is necessary before you use a particular medicine. Under laws governing the supply of medicines, you can obtain medicine under three categories: prescription-only medicines pharmacy medicines general sales list medicines These are explained in more detail below. Prescription-only medicines Prescription-only medicines need a prescription issued by a GP or another suitably qualified healthcare professional. You then take the prescription to a pharmacy or a dispensing GP surgery to collect your medicine. Pharmacy medicines Pharmacy medicines are available from a pharmacy without a prescription, but under the supervision of a pharmacist. You will need to ask staff at the pharmacy for this type of medicine because it is kept behind the counter and is not available on the pharmacy shelves. The pharmacist will check the medicine is appropriate for you and your health problem. They will ask you questions to ensure there is no reason why you should not use the medicine. General sales list medicines General sales list medicines can be bought from pharmacies, supermarkets and other retail outlets without the supervision of a pharmacist. These are sometimes referred to as over-the-counter medicines. Over-the-counter medicines include those that treat minor self-limiting complaints people may feel are not serious enough to see their GP or pharmacist about. Who can prescribe medicine? The main prescribers are called independent prescribers, which include: doctors dentists nurse, pharmacist and optometrist independent prescribers Independent prescribers can assess someone and prescribe a medicine as part of that person's care. There are also supplementary prescribers, who can prescribe any medicine for any condition within their competence, with the agreement of an independent prescriber and the patient. Read more about who can write a prescription. Can medicines change their status? New medicines tend to be licensed in the prescription-only medicines category so that healthcare professionals can supervise their use during the first few years they are available. If a medicine proves safe in large numbers of patients over several years, the regulatory agency may consider changing its status from prescription-only to pharmacy. If it continues to be safe for another few years, a switch to general sales list status may be considered so it can be sold directly from retail outlets. If a medicine switches from prescription only to pharmacy, or from pharmacy to the general sales list, the active ingredient remains exactly the same. This means the medicine is just as effective as when it had to be prescribed by a qualified prescriber. It also means there is the same risk of side effects if you take too high a dose or do not follow the instructions on the label. It is therefore important you follow the instructions carefully. How are medicines developed? In the UK, before any medicine can be used to treat people, it has to be licensed. Licences are only granted if high standards of safety and quality are met throughout the development process and the product works for the purpose intended. In the UK, licenses can only be granted by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Potential medicines are first thoroughly researched using tissue culture, computer analysis techniques and animal testing. If strict standards of safety and effectiveness are met, clinical trials involving humans can then be used. If a medicine passes all the phases of clinical trials, it can be licensed for wider use. The whole process from discovery to licensing can take around 10 to 15 years. Read more about licensing medicines. How are medicines regulated? No medicine is completely risk free, but attempts are made by the MHRA and EMA to ensure any medicine approved for widespread use is as safe as possible. As well as a strictly monitored development process, medicines continue to be carefully regulated after they have been granted a license. This involves checking for problems, such as reports of previously unknown side effects. In rare cases, medicines may be withdrawn if there are significant safety concerns or if the risks of the medicines outweigh the potential benefits. You can help the MHRA monitor the safety of medicines by reporting any suspected side effects to the Yellow Card Scheme. Reports can also be made on behalf of someone you're caring for. The MHRA is the UK medicines watchdog. Its Yellow Card Scheme collects reports of side effects for all medicines (including complementary medicines) and vaccines. If a new side effect is found, the MHRA will review the way the medicine can be used and alert the public to the potential risks. Read more about medicine safety and regulation. Why do the same medicines sometimes have different names? Many medicines have at least two different names \u2013 a brand name and a generic name. The brand name is usually what the medicine is called by the company that first discovered and developed it. The generic name is the name of the active ingredient in the medicine that makes it work. Initially, for a few years the company that developed the medicine is the only one that can sell it, which means they can choose the price. To make a profit from the very costly development process, this usually means the medicine is very expensive at this point. Generic copies are allowed to be made once this period ends. Generic medicines are usually as effective as the brand-name medicine because they contain the same active ingredients. Generic medicines are used more often for treatment because they are as effective as the original medicine, but cost far less. Read more about generic and brand-name medicines.

This means that someone with MCADD can become very ill if their body's energy demands exceed their energy intake, such as during infections or vomiting illnesses when they're unable to eat. Problems occur because fat is only partially broken down, which leads to a lack of energy and a build-up of harmful substances in the body MCADD is a lifelong condition that's present from birth. It's estimated to affect up to 1 in every 8,000 babies born in the UK and is usually picked up using the newborn blood spot test. The full name for MCADD is medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. This page covers: Is MCADD serious? Symptoms of MCADD What causes MCADD? How MCADD is inherited Screening and testing for MCADD How MCADD is treated Information about you Is MCADD serious? MCADD is a potentially serious condition that can be life-threatening if not recognised quickly and treated appropriately. However, most cases are picked up soon after birth and can be managed quite easily (see How MCADD is treated below). With proper care, there's no reason why someone with MCADD cannot live a normal, healthy and active life. Symptoms of MCADD If someone with MCADD becomes unwell and is unable to eat or tolerate food, they may experience the following symptoms: appearing unusually tired and sluggish being sick excessive sweating rapid breathing seizures (fits) Left untreated, more serious and potentially life-threatening problems can develop, including coma and brain damage. You'll be given an emergency contact number to call immediately if you or your child has MCADD and experiences symptoms. If this information isn't easily available, call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department and tell them about your or your child's MCADD. What causes MCADD? MCADD is caused by a fault in the gene that provides the instructions to make an enzyme called medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). This genetic fault causes the enzyme to either not work properly or be missing entirely, which means the body cannot fully break down fat to release energy. If the body needs to break down fat quickly (for example, if you're unwell and haven't eaten for a while), energy cannot be produced quickly enough to meet the body's needs and substances created when fat is partially broken down can build up to harmful levels in the body. This can lead to serious problems if not treated quickly. How MCADD is inherited A child will only be born with MCADD if they inherit a copy of the faulty gene that causes it from both of their parents. The parents won't normally have the condition themselves because they usually only have one copy of the faulty gene each. This is known as being a \"carrier\". It's estimated that up to 1 in every 40 people in the UK could be carriers of the faulty gene that causes MCADD. If both parents are carriers of the faulty gene, there's a: 25% chance each child they have will not inherit any faulty genes and won't have MCADD or be able to pass it on 50% chance each child they have will just inherit a copy of the faulty gene from one parent and be a carrier 25% chance each child they have will inherit copies of the faulty gene from both parents and will have MCADD Read more about genetic inheritance. Screening and testing for MCADD A newborn blood spot test is now offered to all babies in England to help detect problems, including MCADD early on.  When your baby is five to eight days old, a health professional will prick their heel and collect drops of blood on a special card. The blood is then sent to a laboratory to be checked for abnormalities that could indicate MCADD. You should receive the results by the time your baby is six to eight weeks old. You'll be contacted sooner if a problem is found in order to attend a hospital appointment to discuss this further. The screening result isn't 100% accurate, so further urine and blood tests will be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. You, your partner and any other children you have may also be tested to see if you carry the faulty gene that causes MCADD. If you've previously had a child with MCADD, the blood spot test should be carried out within 24-48 hours of birth. How MCADD is treated There's no specific treatment for MCADD. A specialist care team will give you advice about how to look after your child and support them as they get older. Children and adults with MCADD can eat a normal diet, as long as they: frequently take special high energy drinks when they're ill \u2013 this includes common illnesses such as fever, diarrhoea, or vomiting avoid long periods without eating during the newborn period and infancy even when well \u2013 the length of time your child can go without eating is known as the maximum \"safe fasting time\" and it varies depending on age; you'll be given advice about this The high energy drinks used in treating MCADD are available on prescription from your GP. You'll be advised by a specialist dietitian about when to use them and how much to use. If the drinks don't help or your child refuses them, they may need to be treated in hospital. You can find more detailed information about MCADD treatment in the MCADD information sheet for parents and carers (PDF, 116kb) produced by the British Inherited Metabolic Diseases Group (BIMDG). Information about you If you or your child have MCADD, your clinical team will pass information about you\/them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Support groups In addition to the support of your care team, you may find it useful to contact a national or local support group for people with MCADD and their families. One the main groups in the UK is Climb. You can find information about MCADD on its website and you can speak to their Family Advisers for free on 0800 652 3181.

Contact your GP or NHS 111 immediately, or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if you also have pain in or around your eye or any loss of vision. The information below should give you an idea of what might be wrong, although it shouldn't be used to self-diagnose your condition. It covers possible causes for the following eyelid problems, plus specific advice about what to do. You can find out about: swollen eyelids or eyelid cysts   itchy, flaky or sticky eyelids  lumps on or around the eyelids  hooded or droopy upper eyelids  rolling outwards of the lower eyelids (ectropion)  rolling inwards of the eyelids (entropion)  yellow plaques on the eyelids  excessive blinking or uncontrollable closure of the eyelids  Swollen eyelid or eyelid cyst It's quite common for the upper or lower eyelid to become swollen because of a meibomian cyst (also called a chalazion). This occurs when the glands in the eyelid become blocked. These cysts vary in size, from barely visible to the size of a grape. They usually take weeks to develop. They're not usually painful, but can become red and painful if infected. The cysts can come and go by themselves, although they may take a few months to get better. You can help them heal by holding a clean flannel warmed in hot water to the closed eye for five minutes, and repeating this three to four times a day for up to four weeks. Speak to your GP if you have a cyst that doesn't clear up after a month. They can refer you to have it drained through a small incision (cut). This is a simple procedure carried out under local anaesthetic (your eye area will be numbed). It takes just a few minutes and rarely leaves a scar. Also see your GP if the cyst becomes infected because you may need to take antibiotics to prevent a deep lid infection (cellulitis). Another common cause of a swelling on the eyelid is a stye. A stye is a minor infection of the base of an eyelash that usually clears up on its own in a week or two. Holding a warm flannel to it regularly may help it heal faster. Read more about treating styes. Other causes of lid swelling include an allergic reaction and shingles on the face and eye (usually with a rash), but these are less common. Itchy, flaky or sticky eyelids Itchy and flaky eyelids are usually caused by an inflamed eyelid edge (blepharitis) or dry eye. Your eyelids may also stick together and be difficult to open, particularly when you wake up. These conditions can be irritating, but are rarely serious. You can reduce the irritation by keeping the eyelids clean and using artificial tears if your eyes are dry. Read about treating blepharitis and treating dry eyes. Contact dermatitis is another possible cause of itchy or flaky eyelids. This is a type of eczema triggered when the skin comes into contact with something you are irritated by or allergic to, such as make-up. The condition usually clears up after you stop using the substance your skin is reacting to. Sticky eyelids along with red and watering eyes can be caused by conjunctivitis, which is when an infection, allergy or irritant causes the front of the eye to become inflamed. This can get better on its own, although your GP may be able to prescribe medication to treat the underlying cause. Read more about treating conjunctivitis. Lumps on or around the eyelids Just like anywhere else on the skin, lumps can occur on or around the eyelids. Many lumps are simple cysts or styes (see above). However, occasionally a lump can be a sign of a more serious condition such as skin cancer and may need to be removed. See your GP if you're worried about a lump on or around your eyelids. Most skin cancers are basal cell carcinomas, which very rarely spread to other parts of the body. These often appear as a red or pink lump containing small blood vessels, although they can be pearly-white or \"waxy\" looking. Sometimes they may bleed. Less commonly, the lump may be a squamous cell carcinoma, which is more serious as there\u2019s a small risk it could spread to other parts of the body. These usually look like an ulcer with a red base and a scaly and crusted surface. You may also lose eyelashes where the lump is growing. In rare cases, the lump could be a sign of a very serious type of skin cancer called melanoma that can spread to other parts of the body and can be very dangerous. A lump is more likely to be melanoma if it's an irregular shape, dark or changing in colour, and getting a lot bigger over time. Hooded or droopy upper eyelids As you get older, it's quite common to have excess skin above the upper eyelids that can overhang and block your vision. This is called dermatochalasis. If it affects your vision, surgery may be considered to remove the excess skin (blepharoplasty). However, this operation isn\u2019t routinely funded on the NHS so your doctor would need to submit a funding request for this to be considered. If the edge of your upper lid droops down over your eye, it's called ptosis. This is usually age-related and develops slowly. Surgery may be needed if the edge of the lid droops so much your vision is affected. In rare cases, ptosis isn't related to age and may be caused by serious conditions such as myasthenia gravis or a brain tumour. In these cases, it's likely there would be other symptoms too. See your GP immediately if ptosis comes on rapidly, over days or weeks, or if it's associated with other symptoms, such as a headache, loss of vision or a change in the size of the pupil (the black dot at the centre of the eye). Lower eyelid that rolls outwards (ectropion)  As you get older, one or both lower eyelids can sometimes droop away from the eye and turn outwards. This is known as an ectropion. The drooping eyelid can disrupt the normal production of tears, which can cause your eye to become dry, red and irritated. Treatment may not be needed in mild cases, although drops or ointment may help make your eye more comfortable. Sometimes a minor operation is needed to correct the position of the eyelid. Read more about treating ectropion. Eyelids that roll inwards (entropion) Entropion is where the eyelid rolls inwards. It usually affects the lower lids, but it can also affect the upper lids. Like ectropion, this is often age-related. Entropion usually causes an uncomfortable watery eye because the lashes irritate the front of the eye (cornea). If this is mild, using eyedrops may be enough to protect the eye and keep you comfortable. Severe entropion can be painful and cause vision loss by damaging the cornea. Occasionally, a corneal ulcer can form and become infected. Surgery may be needed to correct entropion if it's posing a risk to the health of your eye or is causing considerable discomfort. This is carried out under local anaesthetic. If you have entropion, you should discuss your treatment options with your GP. Consult your GP immediately if your eye becomes painful and red and your vision is affected. Yellow plaques on the eyelids Flat yellow patches (plaques) over the upper or lower eyelids are called xanthelasma.  Although these plaques are harmless, they indicate you have high cholesterol. See your GP because you may be at risk of developing cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks and strokes. Making changes to your diet and taking medication may be recommended to reduce your cholesterol level and reduce your risk of serious problems in the future, although these may not improve the plaques. If you're bothered by the appearance of the plaques, it may be possible for them to be surgically removed or treated with a laser. However, this isn't normally funded on the NHS. Excessive blinking or uncontrollable closure of the eyelids It's quite common and normal for the eyelid to flicker or twitch occasionally, particularly when you're tired. It's more unusual to have repeated spasms of excessive blinking and involuntary closure of one or both eyes. This is a type of dystonia (a movement disorder that causes muscle spasms and contractions) known as blepharospasm. Each spasm can last for a few seconds to a few minutes. The exact cause of blepharospasm is unknown. However, the blinking and closure can be triggered by bright light, stress or tiredness. Severe blepharospasm can be very disabling and embarrassing. However, an effective treatment is available. It involves having small injections of botulinum toxin (such as Botox) into the face to relax the muscles controlling the eyelids. In some cases, your GP may consider referring you to a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nerves) for further investigation.

The most common sign of melanoma is the appearance of a new mole or a change in an existing mole. This can happen anywhere on the body, but the back, legs, arms and face are most commonly affected. In most cases, melanomas have an irregular shape and more than one colour. They may also be larger than normal moles and can sometimes be itchy or bleed. An \"ABCDE checklist\" has been developed for people to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma. Watch a visual guide to moles. Read more about the symptoms of melanoma. These pages mainly cover a type of melanoma known as superficial spreading melanoma, which accounts for around 70% of all melanomas in the UK. Other types of melanoma are summarised below. Nodular melanoma Nodular melanoma is a fast-developing type of melanoma, most common in middle-aged people. It may not develop from an existing mole and can appear in areas of skin that aren't regularly exposed to the sun. Lentigo maligna melanoma Lentigo maligna melanoma is most common in elderly people and those who have spent a lot of time outdoors. It is common on the face and tends to grow slowly over a number of years. Acral lentiginous melanoma  Acral lentiginous melanoma is a rare type of melanoma that usually appears on the palms of the hands and the soles or big toenails of the feet. This is the most common type of melanoma in people with dark skin. Cancer Research UK has more information about the different types of melanoma. Why does melanoma happen? Melanoma happens when some cells in the skin begin to develop abnormally. It is thought that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from natural or artificial sources may be partly responsible. Certain things can increase your chances of developing melanoma, such as having: lots of moles or freckles pale skin that burns easily red or blonde hair a family member who has had melanoma Read more about the causes of melanoma. Diagnosing melanoma See your GP if you notice any change to your moles. Your GP will refer you to a specialist clinic or hospital if they think you have melanoma. In most cases, a suspicious mole will be surgically removed and studied to see if it is cancerous. This is known as a biopsy. You may also have a test to check if melanoma has spread elsewhere in your body. This is known as a sentinel node biopsy. Read more about diagnosing melanoma. How is melanoma treated? The main treatment for melanoma is surgery, although your treatment will depend on your circumstances. If melanoma is diagnosed and treated at an early stage, surgery is usually successful. If melanoma isn't diagnosed until an advanced stage, treatment is mainly used to slow the spread of the cancer and reduce symptoms. This usually involves medicines, such as chemotherapy. Read more about treating melanoma. Once you have had melanoma, there is a chance it may return. This risk is increased if your cancer was widespread and severe. If your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your melanoma returning, you will probably need regular check-ups to monitor your health. You will also be taught how to examine your skin and lymph nodes to help detect melanoma if it returns. Who is affected Melanoma is the 5th most common cancer in the UK with around 13,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed each year. More than a quarter of cases are diagnosed in people under 50, which is unusual compared to most other types of cancer. It's also becoming more common in the UK over time, thought to be caused by increased exposure to UV light from the sun and sunbeds. More than 2,000 people die every year in the UK from melanoma. Can melanoma be prevented? Melanoma is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing it by limiting your exposure to UV light. You can help protect yourself from sun damage by using sunscreen and dressing sensibly in the sun. Sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided. Regularly checking your moles and freckles can help lead to an early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment. Read more about sunscreen and sun safety.

It could be something that happened seconds or minutes ago, or a memorable event that occurred in the past. The loss of memory may have started suddenly, or it may have been getting worse over the last year or so. It's normal to become a bit forgetful as you get older. However, memory loss could be a symptom of something more serious and should be checked by a GP. Memory loss can be distressing for the person affected, and their family. Relatives may fear the worst and assume it's caused by dementia, but this often isn't the case. The following information will tell you: what to do if you're worried about memory loss how to tell if it could be caused by dementia the most common causes of memory loss (but don't rely on this to self-diagnose a condition) how to cope with a poor memory What to do if you're worried about memory loss See your GP if you're worried because you or someone you care for has lost their memory. They'll do an initial assessment and ask questions about symptoms, family history and lifestyle. They may also arrange a blood test. Memory loss has a wide range of possible causes, depending on the type of memory loss. Doctors classify memories as either: immediate memories \u2013 such as sounds, which are only stored for a few seconds short-term or recent memories \u2013 such as telephone numbers, which stay in your memory for 15 to 20 seconds; the brain can store about seven chunks of short-term information at any time long-term or remote memories \u2013 more permanent memories, which have been reinforced because you've repeatedly gone over them in your mind If your GP thinks you or your relative needs an assessment for dementia, or that there may be another more serious underlying condition, such as brain damage, they'll refer you to a specialist. Could memory loss be dementia? If you're reading this because you think your memory problems may be a sign of dementia, rest assured that they probably aren't. A person with dementia won't usually be aware of their memory loss, or may deny it. Your memory loss is likely to be caused by something much more common and treatable, such as depression. You may be worried that someone you care for has dementia. However, bear in mind around 40% of people over 65 have some type of memory problem, and only 15% will develop dementia each year. If your instincts are correct, their denial or lack of awareness of their memory loss can make it difficult to convince them to see a GP. This fact sheet includes information about how to persuade your relative to see a doctor (PDF, 848kb). Signs that someone has dementia As a general guide: Dementia usually occurs in people over the age of 65. The memory loss doesn't happen suddenly, but gets gradually worse over time. Someone with dementia will struggle to remember immediate or recent events, but can still recall events that happened a long time ago. This means that if their long-term memory is affected, it probably isn't dementia. Read more about the symptoms of dementia. Common causes of memory loss GPs often find that people who see them about memory loss are most likely to have: anxiety stress depression Their memory loss is a result of poor concentration and not noticing things in the first place because of a lack of interest. Sleeping problems often make the memory loss worse. Your GP may suggest trying antidepressants. If you have depression or anxiety, your memory problems should get better as the depression or anxiety improves. An elderly person with memory loss is likely to have depression if they also experience changes in behaviour, such as hoarding or being bad tempered. Other common causes of memory loss are: a head injury \u2013 for example, after a car accident a stroke \u2013 this cuts off some of the blood supply to the brain and causes brain tissue to die These will cause sudden memory loss, where you either forget events that happened before the trauma (retrograde amnesia), or you forget everything that happened after the trauma (anterograde amnesia).  Less common causes of memory loss Less commonly, memory loss can be caused by: an underactive thyroid \u2013 where your thyroid gland (found in the neck) doesn't produce enough hormones certain types of medication, such as sedatives and some treatments for Parkinson's disease long-term alcohol misuse bleeding in the brain (subarachnoid haemorrhage) vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency \u2013 for example, as the result of a digestive problem transient global amnesia \u2013 problems with blood flow to part of the brain, which causes sudden episodes of memory loss that a person can't recall afterwards  psychogenic amnesia \u2013 a stressful or traumatic event that causes someone to block out the memory, leaving them unable to remember important information a brain tumour Click on the links above for more information about these conditions. Tips for coping with a poor memory Keep everyday items, such as car keys, in the same place and try to do things in the same order each time. Write information down, and keep paper and a pencil near the phone. Keep a diary at home as well as at work to remind you to do daily tasks. Use an alarm to help you remember to do something in the future, such as taking something out of the oven. Repeat important information you need to remember back to someone.

The Men B vaccine will protect your baby against infection by meningococcal group B bacteria, which are responsible for more than 90% of meningococcal infections in young children. Meningococcal infections can be very serious, causing meningitis and septicaemia (blood poisoning), which can lead to severe brain damage, amputations and, in some cases, death. The Men B vaccine used is called Bexsero.  England was the first country in the world to offer a national, routine and publicly funded Men B vaccination programme using the Bexsero vaccine. When should babies should have the Men B vaccine? The Men B vaccine is offered to babies alongside their other routine vaccinations at: 8 weeks 16 weeks One year  How is the Men B vaccine given? The vaccine is given as a single injection into the baby's thigh. How to get the Men B vaccine Your doctor's surgery or clinic will automatically send you an appointment for you to bring your baby for their Men B vaccination alongside their other routine vaccinations. Most surgeries and health centres run special immunisation or baby clinics. If you can't get to the clinic, contact the surgery to make another appointment. Find out when your baby should have the Men B vaccine. Men B vaccine safety Like all vaccines, the Men B vaccine can cause side effects, but studies suggest they are generally mild and don't last long. Almost 8,000 people, including more than 5,000 babies and toddlers, have had the Men B vaccine during clinical trials to test its safety. Since the vaccine was licensed, almost a million doses have been given, with no safety concerns identified. Read the patient information leaflet for Bexsero. Can the Men B vaccine be given at the same time as other vaccines? The Men B vaccine can be given at the same time as other routine baby vaccinations, such as the 5-in-1 vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine. Can vaccines overload a baby's immune system? Men B vaccine and fever Babies given the Men B vaccine alongside their other routine vaccinations at 8 and 16 weeks are likely to develop fever within the first 24 hours after vaccination. It's important that you give your baby liquid paracetamol following vaccination to reduce the risk of fever. Your nurse will give you more information about paracetamol at your vaccination appointment. Other common side effects include irritability and redness and tenderness at the injection site. The liquid paracetamol will also help with these symptoms. Read this NHS leaflet on how to use paracetamol to prevent and treat fever after Men B vaccination. Read more about possible Men B vaccine side effects. Meningitis B is a killer Meningococcal group B bacteria is a serious cause of life-threatening infections, including meningitis and blood poisoning, worldwide and the leading infectious killer of babies and young children in the UK. There are 12 known groups of meningococcal bacteria, and group B (Men B) is responsible for about 90% of meningococcal infections in the UK. Meningitis and septicaemia caused by meningococcal group B bacteria can affect people of any age, but is most common in babies and young children. Meningococcal infections tend to come in bursts. In the past 20 years, between 500 and 1,700 people every year, mainly babies and young children, have suffered from Men B disease, with around 1 in 10 dying from the infection. Many of those who survive suffer terrible permanent disability, such as amputation, brain damage and epilepsy. Read more about meningitis. Men B vaccine protection There are hundreds of different strains of meningococcal group B bacteria around the world, and some tests predict that the Bexsero Men B vaccine protects against almost 90% of the ones circulating in England. However, it's not yet clear how this will relate to lives saved or cases prevented. How the Men B vaccine works The Men B vaccine is made from three major proteins found on the surface of most meningococcal bacteria, combined with the outer membrane of one Men B strain. Together, these constituents stimulate the immune system to protect against future exposures to meningococcal bacteria. For more detail on the ingredients of the Men B vaccine, read the patient information leaflet for Bexsero. Read more about vaccine ingredients. Different types of meningitis vaccines There are two other vaccines against common strains of meningococcal disease \u2013 the Men ACWY vaccine (against meningococcal groups A, C, W and Y) which is offered on the NHS to 14-year-olds and first-time students and the Hib\/Men C vaccine (against Haemophilus influenza type B and meningococcal group C) for babies at one year old.

The success of the Men C vaccination programme means there are almost no cases of Men C disease in babies or young children on the UK any longer. The dose of Men C vaccine that used to be offered to babies at 12 weeks of age has therefore been removed from the vaccination schedule. All children will continue to be offered the Hib\/Men C vaccine at one year of age, and the Men ACWY vaccine at 14 years of age to provide protection across all age groups.

The Men ACWY vaccine is given by a single injection into the upper arm and protects against four different causes of meningitis and septicaemia \u2013 meningococcal (Men) A, C, W and Y diseases. There are two Men ACWY vaccines called Nimenrix and Menveo. They are very similar and both work equally well. Read the patient information leaflet for Nimenrix. Read the patient information leaflet for Menveo. At what age should teenagers and young people have the vaccine? The Men ACWY vaccination programme is being delivered to teenagers and first-time students in a carefully planned programme over the next three years. The priority is to vaccinate all teenagers from school year 9 onwards before they complete school year 13. There is also a catch-up vaccination programme for first-time students up to the age of 25. Schoolchildren: Children aged 14 (school year 9) will be offered the Men ACWY vaccine in school as part of the routine adolescent schools programme alongside the 3-in-1 teenage booster, and as a direct replacement for the Men C vaccination. University students: Students going to university or college for the first time, including overseas and mature students up to the age of 25, should contact their GP to have the Men ACWY vaccine, ideally before the start of or in the first few weeks of the academic year. Why teenagers and students should have the Men ACWY vaccination Cases of meningitis and septicaemia (blood poisoning) caused by Men W bacteria are rising, due to a particularly deadly strain. Older teenagers and university students are at high risk of infection because many of them mix closely with lots of new people, some of whom may unknowingly carry the meningococcal bacteria. The highest risk of meningitis is in the first year of university, particularly the first few months. As the Men ACWY vaccine is being targeted at those at highest risk, students in their second year or above of university are not included in this vaccination programme. The dangers of Men W disease Cases of meningitis and septicaemia due to Men W have been increasing in England, from 22 cases in 2009 to 117 in 2014. The increase seems to be speeding up in 2015, caused by an aggressive strain of the bug. With early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment, most people with meningococcal disease make a full recovery. But it's fatal in about 1 in 10 cases and can lead to long-term health problems, such as amputation, deafness, epilepsy and learning difficulties. Men W infections are particularly severe and usually need to be treated in intensive care. They have a higher death rate than the more common Men C and Men B strains. The Men ACWY vaccine has previously been recommended only for people at increased risk of meningococcal disease, including people with no spleen or a spleen that doesn\u2019t work properly, for Hajj pilgrims, and for travellers to countries with high rates of meningococcal disease, including parts of Africa and Latin America. More about Men ACWY as a travel vaccine. Men ACWY vaccine effectiveness The Men ACWY vaccine provides good protection against serious infections caused by four different meningococcal groups (A, C, W and Y) including meningitis and septicaemia. The vaccine only contains the sugar coating on the surface of the four groups of meningococcal bacteria and works by triggering the body\u2019s immune system to develop antibodies against the sugar coating without causing disease. Read more about vaccine ingredients. Men ACWY vaccine side effects Like all vaccines, the Men ACWY vaccine can cause side effects, but studies suggest they are generally mild and soon settle. The most common side effects seen in teenagers and young people who receive the vaccine are redness, hardening and itching at the injection site, fever, headache, nausea and fatigue. Who should not have the Men ACWY vaccine? You should not have the Men ACWY vaccine if you are allergic to the vaccine or any of its ingredients. You can find out the vaccine ingredients in the patient information leaflets for Nimenrix and Menveo. You should also check with the doctor or nurse before having the Men ACWY vaccine if you: have a bleeding problem, such as haemophilia, or bruise easily have a high temperature are pregnant or breastfeeding How is meningitis W spread? Meningococcal disease is caused by a bacterium called Neisseria meningitidis (also called the meningococcus). These bacteria can be divided into 13 different groups, of which five (A, B, C, W and Y) are responsible for nearly all serious meningococcal infections. The meningococcal bacteria live in the back of the nose and throat in about 1 in 10 of the population without causing any illness. The bacteria is spread from person to person by close prolonged contact with a person carrying the bacteria, such as coughing, kissing and sneezing. Very occasionally, the meningococcal bacteria can cause serious illness, including meningitis and septicaemia. Meningococcal infections can strike at any age, but babies, young children and teenagers are especially vulnerable. Read more about how meningitis bugs are spread. Men W cases on the increase In England, most meningococcal infections are caused by group B (Men B). Men C, Men W and Men Y are usually responsible for only 10-20% of cases. Although the total number of meningococcal cases in England has been falling since the early 2000s, Men W infections have increased from only 22 cases in 2009 to 117 in 2014. Currently, Men W alone accounts for almost a quarter of all meningococcal infections in England. From 2009 to 2012, an average of four people died of meningitis W each year. Most of the people who died were elderly. But during 2013 and 2014, there were 24 deaths from Men W disease including, for the first time in over a decade, babies and toddlers. Read more about meningitis and septicaemia. Babies, older people and Men W vaccine Only teenagers and young people will be vaccinated against Men W as part of the new vaccination programme. This is so they will be directly protected by the Men ACWY vaccine at a time when they're at increased risk (entering colleges and universities, where they will be socialising more). Vaccinating teenagers against Men W should have the added benefit of indirectly protecting other age groups, including unvaccinated babies, children and older people. This is because teenagers are the age group most likely to carry the meningococcal bacteria at the back of their noses. Vaccinating teenagers will reduce the number of carriers, and therefore spread of the Men W bug, both within their social circles and also to other age groups. How to spot meningitis and septicaemia Men W disease, like all meningococcal infections, can come on suddenly and progress quickly. All meningococcal infections can cause meningitis and septicaemia, but Men W can also cause other illnesses, such as pneumonia and joint infections (septic arthritis). Early symptoms of meningococcal disease include: headache vomiting muscle pain fever cold hands and feet A rash of tiny red pinpricks may also develop once septicaemia has set in. You can tell this is a meningitis rash if it doesn\u2019t fade under pressure \u2013 for instance, when gently pressing a glass against it (the \"glass test\"). If you, or a child or adult you know, has these symptoms, seek urgent medical advice. Don\u2019t wait for a rash to develop. Early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics are vital. Here\u2019s more info on the symptoms of meningitis and the treatment of meningitis. Other meningitis vaccines The Hib\/Men C vaccine is offered as part of the NHS vaccination programme to all babies aged 12 months old. The Men B vaccine (Bexsero) is offered as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme, to all babies aged 2, 4 and 12 months old.

It can cause vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and a feeling of pressure deep inside the ear. People with Ménière's disease usually experience some or all of these symptoms during sudden attacks, which typically last around two to three hours, although it can take a day or two for the symptoms to disappear completely. It's worth noting, however, that the symptoms and severity of Ménière's disease vary widely from person to person. Some people may experience frequent attacks of vertigo along with hearing loss, while others may have severe tinnitus with minor vertigo. Other symptoms include sensitivity to sound (hyperacusis) or distorted sound. See your GP if you experience any of the symptoms of Ménière's disease, so they can try to identify the problem and refer you to a specialist if necessary. Read more about the symptoms and stages of Ménière's disease and diagnosing Ménière's disease. How Ménière's disease progresses Ménière's disease often progresses through different stages. In the early stages, most people have sudden and unpredictable attacks of vertigo, accompanied by nausea, vomiting and dizziness. The attacks of vertigo continue, but may come and go and become less severe. It's common to experience a loss of balance or dizziness before or after these attacks. Permanent hearing loss and tinnitus continue to develop and may be worse during attacks of vertigo. During the later stages, the episodes of vertigo tend to occur less frequently and sometimes stop altogether over time. However, the tinnitus and hearing loss often become worse and you may be left with permanent balance and hearing problems. Who is affected In the UK, it's estimated that around one in 1,000 people have Ménière's disease. Ménière's disease most commonly affects people aged 20-60 and it's thought to be slightly more common in women than men. What causes Ménière's disease? The exact cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, but it's thought to be caused by a problem with pressure deep inside the ear. Factors that can increase your risk of developing Ménière's disease include a family history of the condition and a chemical imbalance in the fluid in your inner ear. Read more about the causes of Ménière's disease. How Ménière's disease is treated Treatments for Ménière\u2019s disease can usually help people with the condition control their symptoms. However, current treatments aren't able to cure the condition. Possible treatments include: medicines to treat the symptoms and prevent attacks changes to your eating habits, such as a low-salt diet balance training (vestibular rehabilitation) relaxation techniques surgery, in more severe cases A number of different surgical procedures may be used to treat Ménières disease, depending on how severe the symptoms are and whether one or both ears are affected. However, the effectiveness of surgery is unclear and research is continuing. Read more about the treatment of Ménière's disease. Support and advice Some people with Ménière's disease also find that the condition affects their mental health. The unpredictable nature of the attacks and the restrictions this can place on your activities can lead to feelings of anxiety and depression. Your GP can offer advice and support if you're finding it difficult to cope with the effect Ménière's disease is having on your life. There are also a number of support groups, such as the Meniere's Society, that can provide assistance and advice. Read more about living with Ménière's disease. Information about you If you have Ménière's disease, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Tinnitus (BSL version) Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video. Tinnitus causes people to hear constant sounds in one ear, both ears or in their head. An audiologist explains the possible causes and effects it often has, such as stress and anxiety, plus how to deal with them. Ashleigh, who was diagnosed with tinnitus in 2005, describes how she copes with it.

It can affect anyone, but is most common in babies, young children, teenagers and young adults. Meningitis can be very serious if not treated quickly. It can cause life-threatening blood poisoning (septicaemia) and result in permanent damage to the brain or nerves. A number of vaccinations are available that offer some protection against meningitis. This page covers: Symptoms of meningitis When to get medical help How meningitis is spread Vaccinations against meningitis Treatments for meningitis Outlook for meningitis Symptoms of meningitis Symptoms of meningitis develop suddenly and can include: a high temperature (fever) over 37.5C (99.5F) being sick a headache a blotchy rash that doesn't fade when a glass is rolled over it (this won't always develop) a stiff neck a dislike of bright lights drowsiness or unresponsiveness seizures (fits)  These symptoms can appear in any order and some may not appear. Read more about the symptoms of meningitis. When to get medical help You should get medical advice as soon as possible if you're concerned that you or your child could have meningitis. Trust your instincts and don't wait until a rash develops. Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately if you think you or your child might be seriously ill. Call NHS 111 or your GP surgery for advice if you're not sure if it's anything serious or you think you may have been exposed to someone with meningitis. How meningitis is spread Meningitis is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Bacterial meningitis is rarer but more serious than viral meningitis. Infections that cause meningitis can be spread through: sneezing coughing kissing sharing utensils, cutlery and toothbrushes Meningitis is usually caught from people who carry these viruses or bacteria in their nose or throat but aren't ill themselves. It can also be caught from someone with meningitis, but this is less common. Read more about the causes of meningitis. Vaccinations against meningitis Vaccinations offer some protection against certain causes of meningitis. These include the: meningitis B vaccine \u2013 offered to babies aged 8 weeks, followed by a second dose at 16 weeks, and a booster at 1 year 5-in-1 vaccine \u2013 offered to babies at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age pneumococcal vaccine \u2013 offered to babies at 8 weeks, 16 weeks and 1 year old meningitis C vaccine \u2013 offered at 12 weeks of age, 1 year, and to teenagers and first-time university students MMR vaccine \u2013 offered to babies at 1 year and a second dose at 3 years and 4 months meningitis ACWY vaccine \u2013 offered to teenagers, sixth formers and \"fresher\" students going to university for the first time Read more about meningitis vaccinations. Treatments for meningitis People with suspected meningitis will usually have tests in hospital to confirm the diagnosis and check whether the condition is the result of a viral or bacterial infection. Bacterial meningitis usually needs to be treated in hospital for at least a week. Treatments include: antibiotics given directly into a vein fluids given directly into a vein oxygen through a face mask Viral meningitis tends to get better on its own within 7 to 10 days and can often be treated at home. Getting plenty of rest and taking painkillers and anti-sickness medication can help relieve the symptoms in the meantime. Read more about how meningitis is treated. Outlook for meningitis  Viral meningitis will usually get better on its own and rarely causes any long-term problems. Most people with bacterial meningitis who are treated quickly will also make a full recovery, although some are left with serious, long-term problems. These can include: hearing loss or vision loss, which may be partial or total problems with memory and concentration recurrent seizures (epilepsy) co-ordination, movement and balance problems loss of limbs \u2013 amputation of affected limbs is sometimes necessary Overall, it's estimated that up to 1 in every 10 cases of bacterial meningitis is fatal.

Periods usually start to become less frequent over a few months or years before they stop altogether. Sometimes they can stop suddenly. The menopause is a natural part of ageing that usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age, as a woman's oestrogen levels decline. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 51. However, around 1 in 100 women experience the menopause before 40 years of age. This is known as premature menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency. Symptoms of the menopause Most women will experience menopausal symptoms. Some of these can be quite severe and have a significant impact on your everyday activities. Common symptoms include: hot flushes  night sweats vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex difficulty sleeping low mood or anxiety reduced sex drive (libido) problems with memory and concentration Menopausal symptoms can begin months or even years before your periods stop and last around four years after your last period, although some women experience them for much longer. Read more about the symptoms of the menopause. When to see your GP It's worth talking to your GP if you have menopausal symptoms that are troubling you or if you're experiencing symptoms of the menopause before 45 years of age. Your GP can usually confirm whether you are menopausal based on your symptoms, but a blood test to measure your hormone levels may be carried out if you're aged 40 to 45. Blood tests may also be carried out to help diagnose suspected premature menopause if you\u2019re under 40 and have menopausal symptoms. Read more about how your GP can help during the menopause. Treatments for menopausal symptoms Your GP can offer treatments and suggest lifestyle changes if you have severe menopausal symptoms that interfere with your day-to-day life, including: hormone replacement therapy (HRT) \u2013 tablets, skin patches, gels and implants that relieve menopausal symptoms by replacing oestrogen vaginal oestrogen creams, lubricants or moisturisers for vaginal dryness cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013 a type of talking therapy that can help with low mood and anxiety eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly \u2013 maintaining a healthy weight and staying fit and strong can improve some menopausal symptoms Your GP can refer you to a menopause specialist if your symptoms don't improve after trying treatment or if you're unable to take HRT. Read more about treating the menopause. What causes the menopause? The menopause is caused by a change in the balance of the body's sex hormones, which occurs as you get older. It happens when your ovaries stop producing as much of the hormone oestrogen and no longer release an egg each month. Premature or early menopause can occur at any age, and in many cases, there's no clear cause. Sometimes it's caused by a treatment such as surgery to remove the ovaries (oophorectomy), some breast cancer treatments, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or it can be brought on by an underlying medical condition, such as Down's syndrome or Addison's disease.

Although it's a common problem, it's not normal to bleed at this time \u2013 even if it's just spotting \u2013 so don't ignore it. Make an appointment to see your GP as soon as possible. The cause is usually something minor, such as inflammation of the womb lining, but cancer is always a possibility that must be ruled out. Most likely causes There can be several reasons for bleeding after the menopause. The most common causes are: inflammation and thinning of the vaginal lining (atrophic vaginitis) or womb lining (endometrial atrophy) \u2013 caused by lower oestrogen levels cervical or womb polyps \u2013 growths, which are usually non-cancerous, that can form in the cervix (neck of the womb) or the womb itself a thickened womb lining (endometrial hyperplasia) \u2013 which can be caused by hormone replacement therapy (HRT), high levels of oestrogen or by being overweight; if left untreated this can lead to development of womb cancer (also known as endometrial cancer) About 1 in every 10 women with postmenopausal bleeding will have womb cancer, and in a few cases bleeding may be a sign of another type of cancer such as vulval, vaginal or cervical cancer. Diagnosing the cause Your GP should refer you to hospital for further tests. This will help to identify the cause of your problem, to exclude cancer and plan necessary treatment. Some areas have specialist postmenopausal bleeding clinics.  The tests that may be carried out can include: a vaginal ultrasound scan a pelvic examination tests on a sample of your womb lining (endometrial biopsy) a camera test called a hysteroscopy These procedures are described below. Some GPs are able to carry out the ultrasound and examination themselves, and will refer you for the hysteroscopy if this is necessary. At the clinic The specialist at the clinic, which may be a nurse, will take your medical history and record your symptoms. You'll then go to the scan room for an examination. Vaginal ultrasound scan A vaginal ultrasound scan is performed by gently inserting a fine ultrasound probe into your vagina, which you may find slightly uncomfortable. It usually takes about 10 minutes. The probe emits high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your vagina and womb, which is then displayed on a monitor. The results of this examination will then be discussed with you, and you'll find out whether you need a biopsy or hysteroscopy. This is mainly determined by the thickness of the womb lining. Pelvic examination The specialist will also carry out a pelvic examination. They will insert a speculum into your vagina, similar to having a cervical screening test, so your vulva, vagina and cervix can be carefully examined. Most women find this a bit uncomfortable. Swabs may be taken from your vagina and\/or cervix to rule out any infection. The doctor may wish to carry out a cervical screening test as well if this is overdue. If the lining of the womb is thickened, a small sample of tissue (biopsy) may be removed using a fine, flexible plastic tube. This can cause cramps and bleeding, which usually settles very quickly. The test can be stopped if you are finding it too uncomfortable, so let the healthcare professional carrying out the test know if you want them to stop. The speculum is then removed and an internal examination is performed. This allows the doctor to gauge the size, shape and consistency of your womb, and also assess if there is any tenderness in your pelvis. Hysteroscopy A hysteroscopy allows the doctor to look inside your womb and remove a small sample of tissue for testing using a fine telescope-like instrument called a hysteroscope. The hysteroscope is passed through your cervix under either local anaesthetic (where the area is numbed so you don't feel any pain) or general anaesthetic (where you are asleep). Read more about having a hysteroscopy. Treating postmenopausal bleeding Treatment depends on what is causing your bleeding. For example, if the cause is cervical polyps, you may need to have them removed. This fairly simple procedure can be done in the specialist's office. Small forceps are used to grasp and gently twist the polyp, which usually comes off easily, and any bleeding is stopped using cautery (heat) or by applying chemicals. Endometrial atrophy can be treated with oestrogen cream or pessaries, although treatment may not be necessary if your symptoms are minimal. There are various types of endometrial hyperplasia which may be treated with hormone medication (tablets or an intrauterine system implant) or surgery to remove your uterus, cervix and ovaries (a total hysterectomy). Occasionally, if the changes are mild, no treatment may be necessary. If your bleeding is thought to be a side effect of HRT, altering or stopping the treatment may be recommended. If you have womb cancer, a total hysterectomy will often be recommended.  Read more about treating womb cancer.

It replaces hormones that are at a lower level as you approach the menopause. This page covers: Benefits of HRT How to get started Who can take it Types of HRT Stopping HRT Risks and side effects Alternatives Benefits of HRT The main benefit of HRT is that it can help relieve most of the menopausal symptoms, such as: hot flushes night sweats mood swings vaginal dryness reduced sex drive Many of these symptoms pass in a few years, but they can be very unpleasant and taking HRT can offer relief for many women. It can also help prevent weakening of the bones (osteoporosis), which is more common after the menopause. How to get started on HRT Speak to your GP if you're interested in starting HRT. You can normally begin HRT as soon as you start experiencing menopausal symptoms and won't usually need to have any tests first. Your GP can explain the different types of HRT available and help you choose one that's suitable for you. You'll usually be started off on a low dose, which can be increased at a later stage. It may take a few weeks to feel the effects of treatment and there may be some side effects at first. Your GP will normally recommend trying treatment for three months to see if it helps. If it doesn't, they may suggest changing your dose or changing the type of HRT you're taking. Who can take HRT Most women can have HRT if they're experiencing symptoms associated with the menopause. But HRT may not be suitable if you: have a history of breast cancer, ovarian cancer or womb cancer have a history of blood clots have untreated high blood pressure \u2013 your blood pressure will need to be controlled before you can start HRT have liver disease are pregnant \u2013 it's still possible to get pregnant while on HRT, so you should use contraception until two years after your last period if you're under 50 or for one year after the age of 50 In these circumstances, alternatives to HRT may be recommended instead. Types of HRT There are many different types of HRT and finding the right one for you can be tricky. There are different: HRT hormones \u2013 most women take a combination of the hormones oestrogen and progestogen, although women who don't have a womb can take oestrogen on its own  ways of taking HRT \u2013 including tablets, skin patches, gels and vaginal creams, pessaries or rings HRT treatment regimens \u2013 HRT medication may be taken continuously without a break, or in cycles where you take oestrogen continuously and only take progestogen every few weeks Your GP can give you advice to help you choose which type is best for you. You may need to try more than one type before you find one that works best. Read more about the different types of HRT. Stopping HRT There's no limit on how long you can take HRT, but talk to your GP about the duration of treatment they recommend. Most women stop taking it once their menopausal symptoms pass, which is usually after a few years. When you decide to stop, you can choose to do so suddenly or gradually. Gradually decreasing your HRT dose is usually recommended because it's less likely to cause your symptoms to come back in the short term. Contact your GP if you have symptoms that persist for several months after you stop HRT, or if you have particularly severe symptoms. You may need to start HRT again. Risks and side effects of HRT As with any medication, HRT can cause side effects. But these will usually pass within three months of starting treatment. Common side effects include: breast tenderness headaches nausea indigestion abdominal (tummy) pain vaginal bleeding Some types of HRT can also cause a small increase in your risk of certain serious problems, such as blood clots and breast cancer. The benefits of HRT are generally felt to outweigh the risks. But speak to your GP if you have any concerns about taking HRT. Read more about side effects of HRT and risks of HRT. Alternatives to HRT If you're unable to take HRT or decide not to, you may want to consider alternative ways of controlling your menopausal symptoms. Alternatives to HRT include: lifestyle measures \u2013 such as exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, cutting down on coffee, alcohol and spicy foods, and stopping smoking tibolone \u2013 a medication that's similar to combined HRT (oestrogen and progestogen), but may not be as effective and is only suitable for women who had their last period more than a year ago antidepressants \u2013 some antidepressants can help with hot flushes and night sweats, although they can also cause unpleasant side effects such as agitation and dizziness clonidine \u2013 a non-hormonal medicine that may help reduce hot flushes and night sweats in some women, although any benefits are likely to be small Several remedies (such as bioidentical hormones) are claimed to help with menopausal symptoms, but these aren't recommended because it's not clear how safe and effective they are.

Other symptoms common in men this age are: mood swings and irritability loss of muscle mass and reduced ability to exercise fat redistribution, such as developing a large belly or \"man boobs\" (gynaecomastia) a general lack of enthusiasm or energy difficulty sleeping (insomnia) or increased tiredness poor concentration and short-term memory These symptoms can interfere with everyday life and happiness, so it's important to find the underlying cause and work out what can be done to resolve it. Is there such a thing as a 'male menopause'? The \"male menopause\" (sometimes called the \"andropause\") is an unhelpful term sometimes used in the media to explain the above symptoms. This label is misleading because it suggests the symptoms are the result of a sudden drop in testosterone in middle age, similar to what occurs in the female menopause. This isn't true. Although testosterone levels fall as men age, the decline is steady \u2013 less than 2% a year from around the age of 30-40 \u2013 and this is unlikely to cause any problems in itself. A testosterone deficiency that develops later in life (also known as late-onset hypogonadism) can sometimes be responsible for these symptoms, but in many cases the symptoms are nothing to do with hormones. Personal or lifestyle issues  Lifestyle factors or psychological problems are often responsible for many of the symptoms described above. For example, erectile dysfunction, loss of libido and mood swings may be the result of either: stress depression anxiety There are also physical causes of erectile dysfunction, such as changes in the blood vessels, which may happen alongside any psychological cause. Read about the causes of erectile dysfunction. Psychological problems are typically brought on by work or relationship issues, divorce, money problems or worrying about ageing parents. A \"midlife crisis\" can also be responsible. This can happen when men think they've reached life's halfway stage. Anxieties over what they've accomplished so far, either in their job or personal life, can lead to a period of depression. Read more about the male midlife crisis. Other possible causes of the above symptoms include: lack of sleep poor diet lack of exercise drinking too much alcohol smoking low self-esteem Late-onset hypogonadism  In some cases, where lifestyle or psychological problems don't seem to be responsible, the symptoms of the \"male menopause\" may be the result of hypogonadism, where the testes produce few or no hormones. Hypogonadism is sometimes present from birth, which can cause symptoms like delayed puberty and small testes. Hypogonadism can also occasionally develop later in life, particularly in men who are obese or have type 2 diabetes. This is known as late-onset hypogonadism and it can cause the \"male menopause\" symptoms mentioned above. However, this is an uncommon and specific medical condition that isn't a normal part of ageing. A diagnosis of late-onset hypogonadism can usually be made based on your symptoms and the results of blood tests used to measure your testosterone levels. What to do If you're experiencing any of the above symptoms, see your GP. They'll ask about your work and personal life, to see if your symptoms may be caused by a mental health issue, such as stress or anxiety. If stress or anxiety are affecting you, you may benefit from medication or a talking therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Exercise and relaxation can also help. Read about: stress management treating anxiety help for low mood and depression exercise for depression and exercise to relieve stress Do I need HRT? Your GP may also order a blood test to measure your testosterone levels. If the results suggest you have a testosterone deficiency, you may be referred to an endocrinologist (a specialist in hormone problems). If the specialist confirms this diagnosis, you may be offered testosterone replacement to correct the hormone deficiency, which should relieve your symptoms.

Vaginal dryness is a common problem that GPs see frequently. Treatments for vaginal dryness The main treatments that can help if you have a dry vagina are: Lubricants Vaginal moisturisers Vaginal oestrogen Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that you apply to your vulva, vagina or your partner's penis just before having sex to keep your vagina moist. They offer immediate but short-term relief from vaginal dryness. Several different brands of lubricant are available to buy from shops and pharmacies without a prescription. You may need to experiment with a few different types to find one that works best for you. Vaginal moisturisers Vaginal moisturisers are creams that you apply inside your vagina to keep it moist. They may be better than lubricants if the dryness isn't just causing problems during sex, as they tend to have a longer-lasting effect. They usually need to be applied every few days. As with lubricants, several different brands are available to buy. You may need to experiment with a few different types to find one that works best for you. Water-based moisturisers are generally best, as oil or petroleum-based products can damage latex condoms and sometimes irritate the vagina.    Vaginal oestrogen Your GP may prescribe vaginal oestrogen if your dryness is caused by the menopause. This works by increasing the level of oestrogen that declines during and after the menopause. Vaginal oestrogen is available as pills you place in your vagina (pessaries), vaginal creams and vaginal rings. These all work equally well, but you may find one type more convenient to use. Oestrogen treatment can be more effective than lubricants and moisturisers for menopausal women, and it generally causes few side effects. However, it can take a few weeks to start working, so you may want to use a lubricant or moisturiser as well to begin with. Treatment usually needs to be continued indefinitely, as the dryness tends to return if treatment stops. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) HRT is a treatment that involves taking medication to replace the hormones that start to decline during the menopause. It's available on prescription from your GP either as tablets, a skin patch, an implant under the skin, or a gel that's applied to the skin. HRT has a wider effect on the body than vaginal oestrogen, so may be best if you have other menopause symptoms, such as hot flushes. However, it also has more side effects.

Menorrhagia can occur by itself or in combination with other symptoms, such as menstrual pain (dysmenorrhoea). Heavy bleeding does not necessarily mean there is anything seriously wrong, but it can affect a woman physically, emotionally and socially, and can cause disruption to everyday life. See your GP if you are worried about heavy bleeding during or between your periods. How much is heavy bleeding? It is difficult to define exactly what a heavy period is because the amount of blood lost during a period can vary considerably between women. The average amount of blood lost during a period is 30-40 millilitres (ml), with 9 out of 10 women losing less than 80ml. Heavy menstrual bleeding is considered to be 60-80ml or more in each cycle. However, it is rarely necessary to measure blood loss. Most women have a good idea about how much bleeding is normal for them during their period and can tell when this amount increases or decreases. A good indication that your blood loss is excessive is if: you feel you are using an unusually high number of tampons or pads you experience flooding (heavy bleeding) through to your clothes or bedding you need to use tampons and towels together What causes heavy periods? In most cases, no underlying cause of heavy periods is identified. However, some conditions and treatments have been linked to menorrhagia, including: uterine fibroids intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs)  anticoagulant medication polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Read more about the causes of heavy periods. Diagnosing heavy periods Your GP should be able to diagnose heavy periods from your symptoms alone. The cause of the problem may sometimes need to be investigated further. This will usually involve having a pelvic examination. A blood test may also sometimes be recommended to check for anaemia (iron deficiency). If a cause is still not found, then you may have an ultrasound scan. Read more about diagnosing heavy periods. Treating heavy periods  In some cases, heavy periods do not need to be treated, as they can be a natural variation and may not disrupt your lifestyle. If treatment is necessary, medication is most commonly used first. However, it may take a while to find the medication most suitable for you, as their effectiveness is different for everyone and some also act as contraceptives. If medication doesn't work, surgery may also be an option. Read more about treating heavy periods.

A period is part of a woman's menstrual cycle. The menstrual cycle is the time from the first day of a woman's period to the day before her next period. A period is a bleed from the womb (uterus) that is released through the vagina. It happens approximately every 28 days, although anywhere between 24 and 35 days is common. Periods can begin when girls are between 8 and 16 years old, but usually start around the age of 12. They continue every month until the menopause (when a woman's periods stop), which usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55.

Many people assume agoraphobia is simply a fear of open spaces, but it's actually a more complex condition. Someone with agoraphobia may be scared of: travelling on public transport visiting a shopping centre leaving home If someone with agoraphobia finds themselves in a stressful situation, they'll usually experience the symptoms of a panic attack, such as: rapid heartbeat rapid breathing (hyperventilating) feeling hot and sweaty feeling sick They'll avoid situations that cause anxiety and may only leave the house with a friend or partner. They'll order groceries online rather than going to the supermarket. This change in behaviour is known as avoidance. Read more about the symptoms of agoraphobia. What causes agoraphobia? Agoraphobia usually develops as a complication of panic disorder, an anxiety disorder involving panic attacks and moments of intense fear. It can arise by associating panic attacks with the places or situations where they occurred and then avoiding them. A minority of people with agoraphobia have no history of panic attacks. In these cases, their fear may be related to issues like a fear of crime, terrorism, illness, or being in an accident. Traumatic events, such as bereavement, may contribute towards agoraphobia, as well as certain genes inherited from your parents. Read more about the possible causes of agoraphobia. Diagnosing agoraphobia Speak to your GP if you think you may be affected by agoraphobia. It should be possible to arrange a telephone consultation if you don't feel ready to visit your GP in person. Your GP will ask you to describe your symptoms, how often they occur, and in what situations. It's very important you tell them how you've been feeling and how your symptoms are affecting you. Your GP may ask you the following questions: Do you find leaving the house stressful? Are there certain places or situations you have to avoid? Do you have any avoidance strategies to help you cope with your symptoms, such as relying on others to shop for you? It can sometimes be difficult to talk about your feelings, emotions, and personal life, but try not to feel anxious or embarrassed. Your GP needs to know as much as possible about your symptoms to make the correct diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment. Read more about diagnosing agoraphobia. Treating agoraphobia With psychological treatment (talking therapies), most people with agoraphobia will make significant improvements, particularly if the three steps described below are followed. A stepwise approach is usually recommended for treating agoraphobia and any underlying panic disorder: step one \u2013 educate yourself about your condition, possible lifestyle changes you can make, and self-help techniques to help relieve symptoms step two \u2013 enrol yourself on a guided self-help programme step three \u2013 more intensive treatments, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or medication Lifestyle changes may include taking regular exercise, eating more healthily, and avoiding alcohol, drugs and drinks that contain caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola. Self-help techniques that can help during a panic attack include staying where you are, focusing on something that's non-threatening and visible, and slow, deep breathing. If your agoraphobia fails to respond to these treatment methods, your GP may suggest trying a guided self-help programme. This involves working through self-help manuals that cover the types of issues you might be facing, along with practical advice about how to deal with them. Medication may be recommended if self-help techniques and lifestyle changes aren't effective in controlling your symptoms. You'll usually be prescribed a course of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are also used to treat anxiety and depression. In severe cases of agoraphobia, medication can be used in combination with other types of treatment, such as CBT and relaxation therapy. Read more about treating agoraphobia. Outlook Around a third of people with agoraphobia eventually achieve a complete cure and remain free from symptoms. Around half experience an improvement in symptoms, but they may have periods when their symptoms become more troublesome \u2013 for example, if they feel stressed. Despite treatment, about one in five people with agoraphobia continue to experience troublesome symptoms.  How common is agoraphobia? In the UK, up to 2 people in 100 have panic disorder. It's thought around a third will go on to develop agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is twice as common in women as men. It usually starts between the ages of 18 and 35.

People with bipolar disorder have periods or episodes of: depression \u2013 feeling very low and lethargic mania \u2013 feeling very high and overactive (less severe mania is known as hypomania) Symptoms of bipolar disorder depend on which mood you're experiencing. Unlike simple mood swings, each extreme episode of bipolar disorder can last for several weeks (or even longer), and some people may not experience a \"normal\" mood very often. Depression You may initially be diagnosed with clinical depression before having a future manic episode (sometimes years later), after which you may be diagnosed with bipolar disorder. During an episode of depression, you may have overwhelming feelings of worthlessness, which can potentially lead to thoughts of suicide. If you're feeling suicidal or having severe depressive symptoms, contact your GP, care co-ordinator or local mental health emergency services as soon as possible. If you want to talk to someone confidentially, call the Samaritans, free of charge, on 116 123. You can talk to them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Alternatively, visit the Samaritans website or email jo@samaritans.org. Mania During a manic phase of bipolar disorder, you may feel very happy and have lots of energy, ambitious plans and ideas. You may spend large amounts of money on things you can't afford and wouldn't normally want. Not feeling like eating or sleeping, talking quickly and becoming annoyed easily are also common characteristics of this phase. You may feel very creative and view the manic phase of bipolar as a positive experience. However, you may also experience symptoms of psychosis, where you see or hear things that aren't there or become convinced of things that aren't true. Living with bipolar disorder The high and low phases of bipolar disorder are often so extreme that they interfere with everyday life. However, there are several options for treating bipolar disorder that can make a difference. They aim to control the effects of an episode and help someone with bipolar disorder live life as normally as possible. The following treatment options are available: medication to prevent episodes of mania, hypomania (less severe mania) and depression \u2013 these are known as mood stabilisers and are taken every day on a long-term basis medication to treat the main symptoms of depression and mania when they occur learning to recognise the triggers and signs of an episode of depression or mania psychological treatment \u2013 such as talking therapy, which can help you deal with depression, and provides advice about how to improve your relationships lifestyle advice \u2013 such as doing regular exercise, planning activities you enjoy that give you a sense of achievement, as well as advice on improving your diet and getting more sleep It's thought using a combination of different treatment methods is the best way to control bipolar disorder. Help and advice for people with a long-term condition or their carers is also available from charities, support groups and associations. This includes self-help and self-management advice, and learning to deal with the practical aspects of a long-term condition. Find out more about living with bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder and pregnancy Bipolar disorder, like all other mental health problems, can get worse during pregnancy. However, specialist help is available if you need it. Read more about bipolar disorder in pregnancy. What causes bipolar disorder? The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, although it's believed a number of things can trigger an episode. Extreme stress, overwhelming problems and life-changing events are thought to contribute, as well as genetic and chemical factors. Who's affected? Bipolar disorder is fairly common and one in every 100 adults will be diagnosed with the condition at some point in their life. Bipolar disorder can occur at any age, although it often develops between the ages of 15 and 19 and rarely develops after 40. Men and women from all backgrounds are equally likely to develop bipolar disorder. The pattern of mood swings in bipolar disorder varies widely between people. For example, some people only have a couple of bipolar episodes in their lifetime and are stable in between, while others have many episodes. Bipolar disorder and driving If you have bipolar disorder, the condition may impair your driving. You must inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about any medical condition that could affect your ability to drive.

This could include: overwhelming feelings of distress, anxiety, worthlessness or anger difficulty managing such feelings without self-harming \u2013 for example, by abusing drugs and alcohol or taking overdoses difficulty maintaining stable and close relationships sometimes having periods of loss of contact with reality in some cases, threats of harm to others Read more about the symptoms of borderline personality disorder. Personality disorders typically emerge in adolescence and persist into adulthood. They may be associated with genetic and family factors, and experiences of distress or fear during childhood, such as neglect or abuse, are common. Personality disorders range from mild to severe. What is borderline personality disorder (BPD)? It used to be thought that people with BPD were at the \"border\" between: neurosis \u2013 where a person is mentally distressed, but can still tell the difference between their perception and reality psychosis \u2013 where a person is unable to tell the difference between their perception and reality, and may experience delusions and hallucinations Now it's known that this is not an accurate description. BPD is best understood as a disorder of mood and how a person interacts with others. BPD is a common personality disorder seen by healthcare professionals. Although BPD is said to be more common in women, this is probably because it is recognised less frequently in men, who may be less likely to seek treatment. Read more about how BPD is diagnosed. How does BPD develop? The causes of BPD are unclear. However, as with most conditions, BPD appears to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Traumatic events that occur during childhood are associated with developing BPD. An estimated 8 out of 10 people with BPD experience parental neglect or physical, sexual or emotional abuse during their childhood. Read more about the causes of BPD. Outlook BPD can be a serious condition, and many people with the condition self-harm and attempt suicide. It is estimated that 60-70% of people with BPD will attempt suicide at some point in their life. However, for many with BPD, the outlook is reasonably good over time, and psychological or medical treatment may help. Treatment may involve a range of individual and group psychological therapies (psychotherapy) carried out by trained professionals working with a community mental health team. Effective treatment may last more than a year. Read more about treatments for BPD. Recent studies have suggested that the majority of those with BPD do well over time, with most experiencing sustained relief from symptoms, and around half being completely free of symptoms and able to function well. Additional treatment is recommended for people whose symptoms return. Mental and emotional health: talking therapies Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

It's most commonly used to treat anxiety and depression, but can be useful for other mental and physical health problems. This topic covers: How it works Uses What happens during a session Pros and cons Finding a therapist How CBT works CBT is based on the concept that your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and actions are interconnected, and that negative thoughts and feelings can trap you in a vicious cycle. CBT aims to help you deal with overwhelming problems in a more positive way by breaking them down into smaller parts. You're shown how to change these negative patterns to improve the way you feel. Unlike some other talking treatments, CBT deals with your current problems, rather than focusing on issues from your past. It looks for practical ways to improve your state of mind on a daily basis. Read more about how CBT works. Uses for CBT CBT has been shown to be an effective way of treating a number of different mental health conditions. In addition to depression or anxiety disorders, CBT can also help people with: obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)  panic disorder post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) phobias eating disorders \u2013 such as anorexia and bulimia sleep problems \u2013 such as insomnia problems related to alcohol misuse CBT is also sometimes used to treat people with long-term health conditions, such as: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) Although CBT can't cure the physical symptoms of these conditions, it can help people cope better with their symptoms. What happens during CBT sessions If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every two weeks. The course of treatment usually lasts for between five and 20 sessions, with each session lasting 30-60 minutes. During the sessions, you'll work with your therapist to break down your problems into their separate parts \u2013 such as your thoughts, physical feelings and actions. You and your therapist will analyse these areas to work out if they're unrealistic or unhelpful and to determine the effect they have on each other and on you. Your therapist will then be able to help you work out how to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours. After working out what you can change, your therapist will ask you to practise these changes in your daily life and you'll discuss how you got on during the next session. The eventual aim of therapy is to teach you to apply the skills you've learnt during treatment to your daily life. This should help you manage your problems and stop them having a negative impact on your life \u2013 even after your course of treatment finishes. Pros and cons of CBT Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be as effective as medication in treating some mental health problems, but it may not be successful or suitable for everyone. Some of the advantages of CBT include: it may be helpful in cases where medication alone hasn't worked it can be completed in a relatively short period of time compared to other talking therapies the highly structured nature of CBT means it can be provided in different formats, including in groups, self-help books and computer programs it teaches you useful and practical strategies that can be used in everyday life \u2013 even after the treatment has finished Some of the disadvantages of CBT to consider include: you need to commit yourself to the process to get the most from it \u2013 a therapist can help and advise you, but they need your co-operation attending regular CBT sessions and carrying out any extra work between sessions can take up a lot of your time it may not be suitable for people with more complex mental health needs or learning difficulties \u2013 as it requires structured sessions it involves confronting your emotions and anxieties \u2013 you may experience initial periods where you're anxious or emotionally uncomfortable it focuses on the individual\u2019s capacity to change themselves (their thoughts, feelings and behaviours) \u2013 which doesn't address any wider problems in systems or families that often have a significant impact on an individual\u2019s health and wellbeing Some critics also argue that because CBT only addresses current problems and focuses on specific issues, it doesn't address the possible underlying causes of mental health conditions, such as an unhappy childhood. Finding a CBT therapist If you think you have a problem that may benefit from treatment with CBT, the first step is usually to speak to your GP.  Your GP may be able to refer you for CBT that's free on the NHS, although you may have to wait.  Find psychological therapy services. If you can afford it, you can choose to pay for your therapy privately. The cost of private therapy sessions varies, but it's usually £40-100 per session. If you're considering having CBT privately, ask your GP if they can suggest a local therapist. The British Association for Behavioural & Cognitive Psychotherapies (BABCP) keeps a register of all accredited therapists in the UK and The British Psychological Society (BPS) has a directory of chartered psychologists, some of whom specialise in CBT.

We all go through spells of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people still think that depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong. Depression is a real illness with real symptoms, and it's not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people can make a full recovery. How to tell if you have depression Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of sadness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety. There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and complaining of various aches and pains. The severity of the symptoms can vary. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit (read about low mood), while at its most severe depression can make you feel suicidal and that life is no longer worth living. For a more detailed list, read more about the symptoms of depression.  Most people experience feelings of stress, sadness or anxiety during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short time, rather than being a sign of depression. Read more information about low mood and depression. If you've been feeling low for more than a few days, take this short test to find out if you're depressed. When to see a doctor It's important to seek help from your GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery.

But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Find out more about the causes of depression. Depression is quite common and affects about one in 10 of us at some point. It affects men and women, young and old. Depression can also strike children. Studies have shown that about 4% of children aged five to 16 in the UK are anxious or depressed. Treatment Treatment for depression involves either medication or talking treatments, or usually a combination of the two. The kind of treatment that your doctor recommends will be based on the type of depression you have. Read more about the treatment of depression. Living with depression Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes such as getting more exercise, cutting down on alcohol, stopping smoking and eating more healthily.  Self-help measures such as reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile.

An obsession is an unwanted and unpleasant thought, image or urge that repeatedly enters a person's mind, causing feelings of anxiety, disgust or unease. A compulsion is a repetitive behaviour or mental act that someone feels they need to carry out to try to temporarily relieve the unpleasant feelings brought on by the obsessive thought. For example, someone with a fear of their house being burgled may feel they need to check all the windows and doors are locked several times before they can leave the house. OCD symptoms can range from mild to severe. Some people with OCD may spend an hour or so a day engaged in obsessive-compulsive thinking and behaviour, but for others the condition can completely take over their life. Read more about the symptoms of OCD. What causes OCD? It's not clear exactly what causes OCD, although a number of factors have been suggested. In some cases the condition may run in families, and may be linked to certain inherited genes that affect the brain's development. Brain imaging studies have shown the brains of some people with OCD can be different from the brains of people who do not have the condition. For example, there may be increased activity in certain areas of the brain, particularly those that deal with strong emotions and the responses to them. Studies have also shown people with OCD have an imbalance of serotonin in their brain. Serotonin is a chemical the brain uses to transmit information from one brain cell to another. Read more about the causes of OCD. Who is affected? It's estimated around 12 in every 1,000 people in the UK are affected by the condition. This equates to almost 750,000 people. OCD affects men, women and children. The condition typically first starts to significantly interfere with a person's life during early adulthood, although problems can develop at any age. Getting help People with OCD are often reluctant to seek help because they feel ashamed or embarrassed. However, if you have OCD, there is nothing to feel ashamed or embarrassed about. It is a long-term health condition like diabetes or asthma, and it is not your fault you have it. Seeking help is important because it is unlikely your symptoms will improve if left untreated, and they may get worse. You should visit your GP if you think you may have OCD. Initially, they will probably ask a number of questions about your symptoms and how they affect you. If your GP suspects OCD, you may need to be referred to a specialist for an assessment and appropriate treatment. Read more about diagnosing OCD. How OCD is treated With treatment, the outlook for OCD is good. Many people will eventually be cured of their OCD, or their symptoms will at least be reduced enough that they can enjoy a good quality of life. The main treatments for OCD are: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013 involving a therapy known as graded exposure with response prevention (ERP), which encourages you to face your fear and let the obsessive thoughts occur without \"neutralising\" them with compulsions selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) \u2013 this medication can help reduce your symptoms by altering the balance of chemicals in your brain If these treatments aren't effective or your condition is particularly severe, you may need to be referred to a specialist mental health service for treatment.

Everyone experiences feelings of anxiety and panic at certain times during their lifetime. It's a natural response to stressful or dangerous situations. However, for someone with panic disorder, feelings of anxiety, stress and panic occur regularly and at any time. Anxiety Anxiety is a feeling of unease. It can range from mild to severe and can include feelings of worry and fear. There are several conditions that can cause severe anxiety including phobias \u2013 an extreme or irrational fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) \u2013 a long-term condition that causes excessive anxiety and worry relating to a variety of situations post-traumatic stress disorder \u2013 a condition with psychological and physical symptoms caused by distressing or frightening events Panic attacks A panic attack occurs when your body experiences a rush of intense psychological (mental) and physical symptoms. You may experience an overwhelming sense of fear, apprehension and anxiety. As well as these feelings, you may also have physical symptoms such as: nausea sweating trembling a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (palpitations) The number of panic attacks you have will depend on how severe your condition is. Some people may have one or two attacks each month, while others may have several attacks a week. Read more about the symptoms of panic disorder. Panic attacks can be very frightening and intense, but they're not dangerous. An attack won't cause you any physical harm, and it's unlikely that you'll be admitted to hospital if you've had a panic attack. What causes panic disorder? As with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn't fully understood. However, it's thought the condition is probably linked to a combination of physical and psychological factors. Read about the possible causes of panic disorder. It\u2019s important to be aware that some physical conditions and disorders can have similar symptoms to those of anxiety. For example: mitral valve prolapse postural orthostatic tachycardic syndrome (POTS) anaemia paroxysmal atrial tachycardia \u2013 episodes of rapid and regular heartbeats that begin and end abruptly thyrotoxicosis \u2013 where large amounts of thyroid hormones are released into the bloodstream, causing rapid heartbeat, sweating, tremor and anxiety poorly controlled diabetes adrenal tumours \u2013 growths that develop on the adrenal glands (two triangular-shaped glands that form part of the kidneys) carcinoid syndrome \u2013 a set of symptoms caused by some carcinoid tumours that can develop in the cells of the endocrine system (glands that produce and secrete hormones) Zollinger-Ellison syndrome \u2013 causes overproduction of insulin and low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) Diagnosing panic disorder See your GP if you have symptoms of anxiety or panic disorder (see above). You may be diagnosed with panic disorder if you experience recurrent and unexpected panic attacks followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks. Read more about how panic disorder is diagnosed. Treating panic disorder The aim of treating panic disorder is to reduce the number of panic attacks you have and ease the severity of your symptoms. Psychological therapy and medication are the two main types of treatment for panic disorder. Read more about treating panic disorder and things you can do to help yourself during a panic attack. Having panic disorder may affect your ability to drive. It's your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about a medical condition that could have an impact on your driving ability. GOV.UK has further information and advice about driving with a disability or health condition. Complications of panic disorder Panic disorder is treatable, but to make a full recovery it's important that you seek medical help as soon as possible. Treatment for panic disorder is much more effective if it's given at an early stage. Left untreated, panic disorder can become a very debilitating and isolating illness. It can also increase your risk of developing other mental health conditions, such as agoraphobia or other phobias. Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn't be available if things go wrong. Read more about the complications of panic disorder.

Changes in how a person feels and distorted beliefs about other people can lead to odd behaviour, which can be distressing and may upset others. Common features include: being overwhelmed by negative feelings such as distress, anxiety, worthlessness or anger avoiding other people and feeling empty and emotionally disconnected difficulty managing negative feelings without self-harming (for example, abusing drugs and alcohol, or taking overdoses) or, in rare cases, threatening other people  odd behaviour difficulty maintaining stable and close relationships, especially with partners, children and professional carers  sometimes, periods of losing contact with reality Symptoms typically get worse with stress. People with personality disorders often experience other mental health problems, especially depression and substance misuse. When and why personality disorders occur Personality disorders typically emerge in adolescence and continue into adulthood. They may be mild, moderate or severe, and people may have periods of \"remission\" where they function well. Personality disorders may be associated with genetic and family factors. Experiences of distress or fear during childhood, such as neglect or abuse, are common. Types of personality disorder Several different types of personality disorder are recognised. They have been broadly grouped into one of three clusters \u2013 A, B or C \u2013 which are summarised below. Read about the symptoms of personality disorders for a full list of the main types and signs of personality disorders. Cluster A personality disorders A person with a cluster A personality disorder tends to have difficulty relating to others and usually shows patterns of behaviour most people would regard as odd and eccentric. Others may describe them as living in a fantasy world of their own. An example is paranoid personality disorder, where the person is extremely distrustful and suspicious. Cluster B personality disorders A person with a cluster B personality disorder struggles to regulate their feelings and often swings between positive and negative views of others. This can lead to patterns of behaviour others describe as dramatic, unpredictable and disturbing. An example is borderline personality disorder, where the person is emotionally unstable, has impulses to self-harm, and has intense and unstable relationships with others. Cluster C personality disorders A person with a cluster C personality disorder struggles with persistent and overwhelming feelings of fear and anxiety. They may show patterns of behaviour most people would regard as antisocial and withdrawn. An example is avoidant personality disorder, where the person appears painfully shy, socially inhibited, feels inadequate and is extremely sensitive to rejection. The person may want to be close to others, but lacks confidence to form a close relationship. How many people are affected? Personality disorders are common mental health problems. In England, it is estimated that around 1 in 20 people has a personality disorder. However, many people have only mild conditions so only need help at times of stress (such as bereavement). Other people with more severe problems may need specialist help for longer periods. Outlook Many people recover from personality disorders over time. Psychological or medical treatment is sometimes helpful; sometimes support is all that is needed. This depends on the severity of the disorder and whether there are ongoing problems. Some mild to moderate personality disorders improve with psychotherapy. Different types of psychological therapies have been shown to help people with personality disorders. However, there is no single approach that suits everyone and treatment should be tailored to the individual. Not all talking therapies are effective and it is essential they are delivered by a trained therapist. Read more information about treating a personality disorder.

Four people who've had mental health issues talk about the negative reactions they faced and how they overcame them. Media last reviewed: Next review due: How common are the different types of personality disorder? Mild personality disorders that do not seriously interfere with a person's ability to function socially are common. Severe disorders are rare and affect less than 2% of the population. In a survey of 8,000 people chosen at random in the UK, the most common personality disorders (PDs) were: obsessive compulsive PD \u2013 found in around 2% of people schizoid PD avoidant PD paranoid PD borderline PD  antisocial PD \u2013 found in less than 1% of people Some people with mild to moderate personality disorders seek treatment. People with more severe personality disorders, especially borderline and antisocial PD, may be more likely to come into contact with medical services due to the consequences of their behaviour, even though they are reluctant to seek treatment. This could be because they may not think there is anything wrong with them, or because they fear contact with health professionals.

A doctor who works in psychiatry is called a psychiatrist. Unlike other mental health professionals, such as psychologists and counsellors, psychiatrists must be medically qualified doctors who have chosen to specialise in psychiatry. This means they can prescribe medication as well as recommend other forms of treatment. Most psychiatrists work as part of community mental health teams (CMHTs), in outpatient clinics or hospital wards. Some carry out sessions in GP surgeries. What conditions can psychiatrists treat? Mental health conditions that may be diagnosed and treated by a psychiatrist include: anxiety  phobias  obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)  personality disorders  schizophrenia and paranoia depression and bipolar disorder eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia sleep disorders, such as insomnia addictions, such as drug or alcohol misuse Psychiatrists may also provide psychological support for people with long-term, painful or terminal physical health conditions. Getting an appointment with a psychiatrist You'll usually need a referral from your GP or another doctor to see a psychiatrist on the NHS. Your GP may refer you directly to a psychiatrist or to a member of a local mental health team, who can assess your needs and help determine if you need to see a psychiatrist or a different mental health professional. You can also see a psychiatrist privately, although most private psychiatrists prefer a referral from your GP. Your GP may be able to recommend psychiatrists in your area. You can also try contacting a psychiatric clinic directly or using online services such as Psychiatry UK. You'll see a psychiatrist who specialises in the area of psychiatry most relevant to your situation. The main areas of expertise include: childhood and adolescent psychiatry general adult psychiatry older person's psychiatry learning disabilities  psychotherapy (talking therapies) You can check the details of a psychiatrist, including their area of speciality, by looking on the medical register, a directory of all practising doctors in the UK. If they have the letters MRCPsych (Member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists) or FRCPsych (Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists) after their name, they're a current member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych). What happens during your appointments During your first appointment, your psychiatrist will carry out an initial assessment. They'll look at both your mental and physical health, and may ask: about the problem that brought you to see them general questions about your life and thoughts to carry out a simple physical examination, such as checking your blood pressure \u2013 for example, before prescribing certain medications to get information from other sources, such as your GP, relatives and social workers After assessing your condition, the psychiatrist may prescribe medication or recommend other treatments, such as counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).  The number of times you need to see a psychiatrist and the length of each appointment will depend on your circumstances. A psychiatrist may continue to manage your treatment or they may refer you to other community mental health services in your area. These services work in small units or clinics and aim to help people manage their illness so they can lead a normal life within the community.

This might involve hallucinations or delusions. The two main symptoms of psychosis are: hallucinations \u2013 where a person hears, sees and, in some cases, feels, smells or tastes things that aren't there; a common hallucination is hearing voices delusions \u2013 where a person believes things that, when examined rationally, are obviously untrue \u2013 for example, thinking your next door neighbour is planning to kill you The combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can often severely disrupt perception, thinking, emotion, and behaviour. Experiencing the symptoms of psychosis is often referred to as having a psychotic episode. What causes psychosis? Psychosis isn't a condition in itself \u2013 it's triggered by other conditions. It's sometimes possible to identify the cause of psychosis as a specific mental health condition, such as: schizophrenia \u2013 a condition that causes a range of psychological symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions bipolar disorder \u2013 a mental health condition that affects mood; a person with bipolar disorder can have episodes of depression (lows) and mania (highs) severe depression \u2013 some people with depression also have symptoms of psychosis when they're very depressed Psychosis can also be triggered by traumatic experiences, stress, or physical conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, a brain tumour, or as a result of drug misuse or alcohol misuse. How often a psychotic episode occurs and how long it lasts can depend on the underlying cause. For example, schizophrenia can be long term, but most people can make a good recovery and about a quarter only have a single psychotic episode. Episodes related to bipolar disorder usually resolve, but may recur. Read more about the causes of psychosis. Diagnosing psychosis You should see your GP immediately if you're experiencing psychotic episodes. It's important psychosis is treated as soon as possible as early treatment usually has better long-term outcomes. Your GP will look at your symptoms and rule out short-term causes, such as drug misuse. They may ask you some questions to help determine what's causing your psychosis. For example, they may ask you: whether you're taking any medication whether you've been taking illegal substances how your mood has been \u2013 for example, whether you've been depressed how you've been functioning day-to-day \u2013 for example, whether you're still working whether you have a family history of mental health conditions \u2013 such as schizophrenia about your hallucinations \u2013 such as whether you've heard voices about your delusions \u2013 such as whether you feel people are controlling you whether you have any other symptoms Your GP should refer you to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment. Read more about diagnosing psychosis. Treating psychosis Treatment for psychosis involves using a combination of: antipsychotic medication \u2013 which can help relieve the symptoms of psychosis psychological therapies \u2013 the one-to-one talking therapy cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has proved successful in helping people with schizophrenia; in appropriate cases, family therapy has been shown to reduce the need for hospital treatment in people with psychosis social support \u2013 support with social needs, such as education, employment, or accommodation Most people with psychosis who get better with medication need to continue taking it for at least a year. Some people need to take medication long term to prevent symptoms recurring. If a person's psychotic episodes are severe, they may need to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Read more about the treatment of psychosis. Getting help for others People with psychosis often have a lack of insight. They're unaware that they're thinking and acting strangely. Because of their lack of insight, it's often down to the friends, relatives, or carers of a person affected by psychosis to seek help for them. If you're concerned about someone you know and think they may have psychosis, you could contact their social worker or community mental health nurse if they've previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition. If you think the person's symptoms are placing them at possible risk of harm, you can: take them to the nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if they agree call their GP or local out-of-hours GP call 999 and ask for an ambulance Read more about how to get help for others. Complications People with a history of psychosis are much more likely to have drug or alcohol misuse problems, or both. This may be because these substances can provide short-term symptom relief, although they usually make symptoms worse in the long term. People with psychosis also have a higher than average risk of suicide. It's estimated 1 in 5 people with psychosis will attempt to commit suicide at some point in their life, and 1 in 25 people with psychosis will kill themselves. Side effects can also occur if someone is taking antipsychotics on a long-term basis. Weight gain is a common side effect. In rare cases, a person with psychosis may also develop type 2 diabetes.

It involves talking to a trained therapist, either one-to-one, in a group or with your wife, husband or partner. It allows you to look deeper into your problems and worries, and deal with troublesome habits and a wide range of mental disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia. Psychotherapy usually involves talking, but sometimes other methods may be used \u2013 for example, art, music, drama and movement. Psychotherapy can help you discuss feelings you have about yourself and other people, particularly family and those close to you. In some cases, couples or families are offered joint therapy sessions together. You will meet your therapist regularly, usually once a week, for several months, or sometimes even years. Individual sessions last about 50 minutes, but group sessions are often a bit longer. Read more about how psychotherapy works. Psychotherapists Psychotherapists are mental health professionals who are trained to listen to a person's problems to try to find out what's causing them and help them find a solution. As well as listening and discussing important issues with you, a psychotherapist can suggest strategies for resolving problems and, if necessary, help you change your attitudes and behaviour. Some therapists teach specific skills to help you tolerate painful emotions, manage relationships more effectively, or improve behaviour. You may also be encouraged to develop your own solutions. In group therapy, the members support each other with advice and encouragement. A therapist will treat sessions as confidential. This means you can trust them with information that may be personal or embarrassing. What is psychotherapy used to treat? Psychotherapy can be used to treat a wide range of mental health conditions, including:  depression  anxiety disorders  borderline personality disorder (BPD)   obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)  long-term illnesses eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia and binge eating drug misuse People with significant emotional problems may also benefit from psychotherapy, including people dealing with stress, bereavement, divorce, redundancy, or relationship problems.

It teaches skills that retrain your behaviour and style of thinking to help you deal with stressful situations. cognitive analytical therapy (CAT) \u2013 uses methods from both psychodynamic psychotherapy and CBT to work out how your behaviour causes problems, and how to improve it through self-help and experimentation. interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) \u2013 looks at the way an illness can be triggered by events involving relationships with others, such as bereavements, disputes or relocation. It helps you cope with the feelings involved, as well as work out coping strategies. humanistic therapies \u2013 encourage you to think about yourself more positively and aim to improve your self-awareness. family and couple (systemic) therapy \u2013 therapy with other members of your family that aims to help you work out problems together. The type of therapy that's most suitable for you will depend on the problem you have. Read more about how psychotherapy works. How can I get psychotherapy? If you think you might benefit from psychotherapy, the best place to start is with your GP. In some cases, it may be possible for your GP or another healthcare professional to refer you a qualified psychotherapist for free treatment on the NHS. However, waiting lists for NHS treatment are often long. Alternatively, you might choose to pay for private treatment. In these cases, it's important to make sure your therapist is registered with a recognised professional organisation and to be aware of the costs involved. Typically, a 50-minute one-to-one session can range from £40 to £100. Read more about the availability of psychotherapy. Finding psychotherapy services When looking for a psychotherapist, make sure they're fully qualified and, if appropriate, that they have experience of treating your specific condition.

Your GP may also be able to recommend a local qualified psychotherapist, or you can check the registers of the various organisations of registered psychotherapists. For example, the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) can help you find a therapist, as can the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP).

SAD is sometimes known as \"winter depression\" because the symptoms are more apparent and tend to be more severe during the winter. The symptoms often begin in the autumn as the days start getting shorter. They're typically most severe during December, January and February. SAD often improves and disappears in the spring and summer, although it may return each autumn and winter in a repetitive pattern. Symptoms of SAD Symptoms of SAD can include: a persistent low mood a loss of pleasure or interest in normal everyday activities irritability feelings of despair, guilt and worthlessness feeling lethargic (lacking in energy) and sleepy during the day sleeping for longer than normal and finding it hard to get up in the morning craving carbohydrates and gaining weight For some people, these symptoms can be severe and have a significant impact on their day-to-day activities. Read more about the symptoms of SAD.  When to see your GP You should consider seeing your GP if you think you might have SAD and you're struggling to cope. Your GP can carry out an assessment to check your mental health. They may ask you about your mood, lifestyle, eating habits and sleeping patterns, plus any seasonal changes in your thoughts and behaviour. Read more about diagnosing SAD. What causes SAD? The exact cause of SAD isn't fully understood, but it's often linked to reduced exposure to sunlight during the shorter autumn and winter days. The main theory is that a lack of sunlight might stop a part of the brain called the hypothalamus working properly, which may affect the: production of melatonin \u2013 melatonin is a hormone that makes you feel sleepy; in people with SAD, the body may produce it in higher than normal levels production of serotonin \u2013 serotonin is a hormone that affects your mood, appetite and sleep; a lack of sunlight may lead to lower serotonin levels, which is linked to feelings of depression body's internal clock (circadian rhythm) \u2013 your body uses sunlight to time various important functions, such as when you wake up, so lower light levels during the winter may disrupt your body clock and lead to symptoms of SAD It's also possible that some people are more vulnerable to SAD as a result of their genes, as some cases appear to run in families. Treatments for SAD A range of treatments are available for SAD. Your GP will recommend the most suitable treatment programme for you. The main treatments are: lifestyle measures, including getting as much natural sunlight as possible, exercising regularly and managing your stress levels light therapy \u2013 where a special lamp called a light box is used to simulate exposure to sunlight talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or counselling  antidepressant medication, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Read more about how seasonal affective disorder is treated.

It's usually a way of coping with or expressing overwhelming emotional distress. Sometimes when people self-harm, they feel on some level that they intend to die. Over half of people who die by suicide have a history of self-harm. However, the intention is more often to punish themselves, express their distress or relieve unbearable tension. Sometimes the reason is a mixture of both. Self-harm can also be a cry for help. Getting help If you're self-harming, you should see your GP for help. They can refer you to healthcare professionals at a local community mental health service for further assessment. This assessment will result in your care team working out a treatment plan with you to help with your distress. Treatment for people who self-harm usually involves seeing a therapist to discuss your thoughts and feelings, and how these affect your behaviour and wellbeing. They can also teach you coping strategies to help prevent further episodes of self-harm. If you're badly depressed, it could also involve taking antidepressants or other medication. Read more about getting help if you self-harm. Useful organisations There are organisations that offer support and advice for people who self-harm, as well as their friends and families. These include: Samaritans \u2013 call 116 123 (open 24 hours a day), email: jo@samaritans.org or visit your local Samaritans branch Mind \u2013 call 0300 123 3393 or text 86463 (9am-6pm on weekdays) Harmless \u2013 email info@harmless.org.uk National Self Harm Network forums YoungMinds Parents Helpline \u2013 call 0808 802 5544 (9.30-4pm on weekdays) Find more mental health helplines. Types of self-harm There are many different ways people can intentionally harm themselves, such as: cutting or burning their skin punching or hitting themselves poisoning themselves with tablets or toxic chemicals misusing alcohol or drugs deliberately starving themselves (anorexia nervosa) or binge eating (bulimia nervosa) excessively exercising People often try to keep self-harm a secret because of shame or fear of discovery. For example, if they're cutting themselves, they may cover up their skin and avoid discussing the problem. It's often up to close family and friends to notice when somebody is self-harming, and to approach the subject with care and understanding.  Signs of self-harm If you think a friend or relative is self-harming, look out for any of the following signs: unexplained cuts, bruises or cigarette burns, usually on their wrists, arms, thighs and chest keeping themselves fully covered at all times, even in hot weather signs of depression, such as low mood, tearfulness or a lack of motivation or interest in anything self-loathing and expressing a wish to punish themselves not wanting to go on and wishing to end it all becoming very withdrawn and not speaking to others changes in eating habits or being secretive about eating, and any unusual weight loss or weight gain signs of low self-esteem, such as blaming themselves for any problems or thinking they're not good enough for something signs they have been pulling out their hair signs of alcohol or drugs misuse People who self-harm can seriously hurt themselves, so it's important that they speak to a GP about the underlying issue and request treatment or therapy that could help them. Why people self-harm Self-harm is more common than many people realise, especially among younger people. It's estimated around 10% of young people self-harm at some point, but people of all ages do. This figure is also likely to be an underestimate, as not everyone seeks help. In most cases, people who self-harm do it to help them cope with overwhelming emotional issues, which may be caused by: social problems \u2013 such as being bullied, having difficulties at work or school, having difficult relationships with friends or family, coming to terms with their sexuality if they think they might be gay or bisexual, or coping with cultural expectations, such as an arranged marriage trauma \u2013 such as physical or sexual abuse, the death of a close family member or friend, or having a miscarriage psychological causes \u2013 such as having repeated thoughts or voices telling them to self-harm, disassociating (losing touch with who they are and with their surroundings), or borderline personality disorder These issues can lead to a build-up of intense feelings of anger, guilt, hopelessness and self-hatred. The person may not know who to turn to for help and self-harming may become a way to release these pent-up feelings. Self-harm is linked to anxiety and depression. These mental health conditions can affect people of any age. Self-harm can also occur alongside antisocial behaviour, such as misbehaving at school or getting into trouble with the police. Although some people who self-harm are at a high risk of suicide, many people who self-harm don't want to end their lives. In fact, the self-harm may help them cope with emotional distress, so they don't feel the need to kill themselves.

It's usually linked to asbestos exposure. Mesothelioma mainly affects the lining of the lungs (pleural mesothelioma), although it can also affect the lining of the tummy (peritoneal mesothelioma), heart or testicles. More than 2,600 people are diagnosed with the condition each year in the UK. Most cases are diagnosed in people aged 60-80 and men are affected more commonly than women. Unfortunately it's rarely possible to cure mesothelioma, although treatment can help control the symptoms. This page covers: Symptoms of mesothelioma What causes mesothelioma? How mesothelioma is diagnosed Treatments for mesothelioma Outlook for mesothelioma Links to more information Symptoms of mesothelioma The symptoms of mesothelioma tend to develop gradually over time. They typically don't appear until several decades after exposure to asbestos. Symptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the lungs include: chest pain shortness of breath fatigue (extreme tiredness) a high temperature (fever) and sweating, particularly at night a persistent cough loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss clubbed (swollen) fingertips Symptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the tummy include: tummy pain or swelling feeling or being sick loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss diarrhoea or constipation See your GP if you have any persistent or worrying symptoms. Tell them about any exposure to asbestos you may have had in the past. What causes mesothelioma? Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos, a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres that used to be widely used in construction. These tiny fibres can easily get in the lungs, where they get stuck, damaging the lungs over time. It usually takes a while for this to cause any obvious problems, with mesothelioma typically developing more than 20 years after exposure to asbestos. The use of asbestos was completely banned in 1999, so the risk of exposure is much lower nowadays. However, materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings. Read more about asbestos and people at risk of exposure and avoiding exposure to asbestos. How mesothelioma is diagnosed If your GP suspects mesothelioma, they will refer you to a hospital specialist for some tests. A number of different tests may need to be carried out, including: an X-ray of your chest or tummy a computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 a number of X-ray images are taken to create a detailed image of the inside of the body fluid drainage \u2013 if there's a build-up of fluid around the lungs or in the tummy, a sample may be removed using a needle inserted through the skin so the fluid can be analysed a thoracoscopy or laparoscopy \u2013 the inside of your chest or tummy is examined with a long, thin camera that's inserted through a small cut (incision) under sedation or anaesthetic; a sample of tissue (biopsy) may be removed so it can be analysed These tests can help diagnose mesothelioma and show how far it has spread. Treatments for mesothelioma The best treatment for mesothelioma depends on several factors, including how far the cancer has spread and your general health. As mesothelioma is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, treatment is usually focused on controlling the symptoms and prolonging life for as long as possible. This is known as palliative or supportive care. Possible treatments include: chemotherapy \u2013 this is the main treatment for mesothelioma and involves using medicine to help shrink the cancer radiotherapy \u2013 this involves using high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells and it may be used to slow the cancer down and keep it under control surgery \u2013 an operation to remove the cancerous area can be done if mesothelioma is detected at a very early stage, although it's not clear whether surgery is helpful You'll also probably have treatment for your individual symptoms to help you feel as comfortable as possible. For example, regularly draining fluid from your chest may help your breathing and strong painkillers may help relieve your pain. Sometimes, a procedure is carried out to stop the fluid coming back again by making the outside of the lungs stick to the inside of your chest (pleurodesis), or a tube is put in your chest to drain the fluid regularly at home. Your doctors should discuss these treatments with you. Outlook for mesothelioma Unfortunately the outlook for mesothelioma tends to be poor. This is because it doesn't usually cause any obvious symptoms until late on and it can progress quite quickly once it reaches this stage. Overall: around half (50%) of people with mesothelioma will live at least a year after diagnosis around one in every 10 people (10%) with mesothelioma will live at least five years after diagnosis There are currently around 2,500 deaths from mesothelioma each year in the UK.

It puts you at greater risk of heart disease, stroke and other conditions affecting blood vessels. On their own, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity can potentially damage your blood vessels, but having all three together is particularly dangerous. They are very common conditions that are all linked, which explains why metabolic syndrome affects an estimated one in four adults in the UK. What are the symptoms? People with metabolic syndrome will have: a waist circumference of 37 inches or more (in European men) or 31.5 inches or more (in European and South Asian women) a waist circumference of 35.5 inches or more (in South Asian men) high levels of triglycerides and low levels of HDL (\"good\" cholesterol) in the blood, which can lead to atherosclerosis \u2013 where arteries become clogged up by fatty substances such as cholesterol high blood pressure that is consistently 140\/90mmHg or higher an inability to control blood sugar levels (insulin resistance) an increased risk of developing blood clots, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  a tendency to develop inflammation (irritation and swelling of body tissue) What are the causes? The factors that can cause metabolic syndrome are: having an inherited genetic tendency towards insulin resistance  being overweight being physically inactive In other words, you can develop metabolic syndrome if you were born with a tendency to develop insulin resistance, and you go on to develop this by putting on weight and not exercising. Metabolic syndrome is especially common in Asian and African-Carribean people, and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). What can I do? You can prevent or reverse metabolic syndrome by: losing weight  getting active  eating healthily to keep blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels under control stopping smoking  cutting down on alcohol  if necessary, take medication to control high blood sugar and cholesterol levels (read about the treatment of diabetes and the treatment of high cholesterol) The above links will take you to information and practical advice to help you make these lifestyle changes.

He describes how you'll be assessed and given an individually tailored weight loss plan. Elinor, who had health problems caused by her weight, explains why she asked her GP for help instead of choosing to follow a commercial diet.

It's not uncommon, and there's usually an obvious reason for it. Sometimes, a problem with your sense of taste can actually be a smell problem, or linked with this. Learn about smelling odours that aren't there and loss of sense of smell. Otherwise, read on to discover the most common reasons for a metallic taste in the mouth. Gum disease Gum disease is a very common condition where the gums become swollen, sore or infected. The gums tend to bleed after you brush or floss your teeth, and the blood in your mouth causes the metallic taste. If left untreated, the tissues and bone that support the teeth can also become affected (known as periodontitis). This, too, can cause an unpleasant taste in your mouth and result in bad breath, loose teeth, and gum abscesses (collections of pus that develop under your gums or teeth). Read how you can treat gum disease. Pregnancy Some pregnant women experience a metallic taste in their mouth during the early stages of pregnancy, because of the hormone changes. It's also fairly common to crave certain foods, or go off certain foods, and have a heightened sense of smell. Learn more about the signs and symptoms of pregnancy. Problem with the airways A cold, sinus infection, runny nose from allergies (allergic rhinitis) or nasal polyps can all cause a metallic taste in the mouth. The links will take you to more information on these conditions. Treatment side effects A wide range of medication can cause a metallic taste in the mouth as a side effect. Examples are: antibiotics (such as metronidazole) antifungal medicine antihistamines chemotherapy diuretics steroid medication nicotine patches If you suspect that a medication you're taking may be causing the metallic taste, you can check the patient information leaflet. Cancer treatment Taste changes are a common side effect of chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the neck and head, because of damage to the taste buds and salivary glands. Read a factsheet from Macmillan about taste changes and cancer and how you can make food more enjoyable.

It affects the metatarsals, the bones connecting the ankle bones to the toes. They're a common source of pain because they support your weight when you're standing, walking and running. Metatarsalgia can have a number of different causes, including wearing unsupportive footwear, conditions such as arthritis, and doing high-impact sports. It can be very uncomfortable and interfere with your normal activities, but will often improve with some simple self-help measures. This page covers: Symptoms of metatarsalgia What causes metatarsalgia? Treating and preventing metatarsalgia When to get medical advice Symptoms of metatarsalgia Metatarsalgia tends to develop gradually over time. It may be felt in a small area of the foot, or across the whole width of it. One or both feet may be affected. The pain of metatarsalgia is sometimes described as: a burning or aching sensation a shooting pain tingling or numbness in the toes a feeling like there's a small stone stuck under the foot Metatarsalgia tends to be worse when you're standing, walking or running. What causes metatarsalgia? Metatarsalgia is usually the result of increased pressure on the ball of the foot. Some common causes of metatarsalgia include: badly fitting footwear \u2013 high-heeled or restrictive shoes can force the ball of the foot into a small amount of space, which puts more pressure on that area high-impact sports \u2013 sports like running or tennis put extra pressure on the feet being overweight or obese \u2013 this can also increase the pressure on the feet an unusual bone structure in the feet \u2013 having narrow, high-arched or flat feet can increase the chances of metatarsalgia joint and foot conditions \u2013 including arthritis, gout, bunions, bursitis, Morton's neuroma, hammer toes, and stress fractures Metatarsalgia is also more common in older people and people with diabetes. Treating and preventing metatarsalgia The following measures will often help improve metatarsalgia and stop it coming back: rest your feet \u2013 put your feet up regularly and avoid activities that make the pain worse; try low-impact activities such as cycling or swimming instead of sports that involve a lot of running or jumping use an ice pack \u2013 apply an ice pack to the affected area for about 20 minutes several times a day (a bag of frozen peas will also work); make sure you wrap it in a towel so it doesn't damage your skin change your footwear \u2013 try flat shoes that have plenty of room for your feet and have a well-cushioned sole; replace any worn out shoes as they could make things worse (read more about choosing sports shoes and trainers) use shock-absorbing pads or insoles \u2013 these can fit inside your shoes to help cushion your feet; they're available from pharmacies and sports shops, or can be bought online maintain a healthy weight \u2013 adopting a healthy, balanced diet and doing regular low-impact exercises can help you lose weight if you're overweight take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help relieve pain and swelling if necessary Try these measures for a few weeks to see if your symptoms improve. When to get medical advice You can usually treat metatarsalgia at home without seeing your GP. However, you should get medical advice if: the pain doesn't improve despite trying self-help measures the pain significantly interferes with your normal activities you develop sudden and very severe foot pain or a change in the shape of your foot \u2013 this could be a sign of a more serious problem that requires immediate treatment Your GP can arrange a number of tests to check for any underlying problems, such as X-rays, scans or blood tests. They can also refer you to a health professional that specialises in foot care, such as a podiatrist (also known as a chiropodist), physiotherapist, or foot and ankle surgeon. These specialists may recommend additional treatments, such as custom-made insoles (orthotics), foot and ankle exercises, steroid injections or, in rare cases, surgery.

This means MRSA infections can be more difficult to treat than other bacterial infections.  The full name of MRSA is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. You may have heard it called a \"superbug\". Staphylococcus aureus (also known as staph) is a common type of bacteria. It's often carried on the skin and inside the nostrils and throat, and can cause mild infections of the skin, such as boils and impetigo. If the bacteria get into a break in the skin, they can cause life-threatening infections, such as blood poisoning or endocarditis. Read more about the symptoms of an MRSA infection. How do you get MRSA? MRSA bacteria are usually spread through skin-to-skin contact with someone who has an MRSA infection or has the bacteria living on their skin. The bacteria can also be spread through contact with contaminated objects such towels, sheets, clothes, dressings, surfaces, door handles and floors. People staying in hospital are most at risk of becoming infected with MRSA because: they're surrounded by a large number of people, which means the bacteria can spread more easily they often have an entry point for the bacteria to get into their body, such as a surgical wound or urinary catheter they may have serious or complex health problems, which makes them more vulnerable to infection It's also possible to become infected with MRSA outside of hospital, although this is much less common. Read more about the possible causes of MRSA.  Preventing MRSA In recent years, rates of MRSA have fallen because of increased awareness of the infection by both medical staff and the public. However, MRSA still places a considerable strain on healthcare services. Some people who need to be admitted to hospital will have MRSA screening beforehand (see below), but there are also some things you can do yourself to reduce your risk of becoming infected. These include: washing your hands frequently \u2013 especially after using the toilet, and before and after eating following any advice you're given about wound care and devices that could lead to infection (such as urinary catheters) reporting any unclean toilet or bathroom facilities to staff \u2013 don't be afraid to talk to staff if you're concerned about hygiene If you're visiting someone in hospital, you can reduce the chance of spreading MRSA by cleaning your hands before and after entering the ward. You should also use hand wipes or hand gel before touching the person you're visiting. Read more about preventing MRSA. Screening for MRSA Some patients admitted to hospital for planned or emergency care are screened to see if they carry MRSA on their skin. This helps to reduce the chance of patients developing an MRSA infection or passing an infection on to other patients. During the screening process, a cotton bud (swab) will be run over your skin, so it can be checked for MRSA bacteria. Swabs may be taken from different places, such as the inside of your nose, your throat, armpit, groin and any areas of damaged or open skin. If MRSA bacteria are found, treatment with antibacterial bodywash or shampoo and nasal cream to remove the bacteria from your skin will usually need to be carried out before you're admitted. Read more about MRSA screening. Treating MRSA infections Although MRSA infections can be more difficult to treat than other bacterial infections, they're still treatable because the MRSA bacteria aren't resistant to all antibiotics. Minor skin infections may not always require any treatment, other than draining away any pus from the site of the infection, but in most other cases you'll be treated with antibiotics that MRSA has not yet developed resistance to. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, antibiotic tablets or injections will be used and you may need to have a combination of antibiotics or take types of antibiotics that are rarely used for less serious infections.

It can cause vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and a feeling of pressure deep inside the ear. People with Ménière's disease usually experience some or all of these symptoms during sudden attacks, which typically last around two to three hours, although it can take a day or two for the symptoms to disappear completely. It's worth noting, however, that the symptoms and severity of Ménière's disease vary widely from person to person. Some people may experience frequent attacks of vertigo along with hearing loss, while others may have severe tinnitus with minor vertigo. Other symptoms include sensitivity to sound (hyperacusis) or distorted sound. See your GP if you experience any of the symptoms of Ménière's disease, so they can try to identify the problem and refer you to a specialist if necessary. Read more about the symptoms and stages of Ménière's disease and diagnosing Ménière's disease. How Ménière's disease progresses Ménière's disease often progresses through different stages. In the early stages, most people have sudden and unpredictable attacks of vertigo, accompanied by nausea, vomiting and dizziness. The attacks of vertigo continue, but may come and go and become less severe. It's common to experience a loss of balance or dizziness before or after these attacks. Permanent hearing loss and tinnitus continue to develop and may be worse during attacks of vertigo. During the later stages, the episodes of vertigo tend to occur less frequently and sometimes stop altogether over time. However, the tinnitus and hearing loss often become worse and you may be left with permanent balance and hearing problems. Who is affected In the UK, it's estimated that around one in 1,000 people have Ménière's disease. Ménière's disease most commonly affects people aged 20-60 and it's thought to be slightly more common in women than men. What causes Ménière's disease? The exact cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, but it's thought to be caused by a problem with pressure deep inside the ear. Factors that can increase your risk of developing Ménière's disease include a family history of the condition and a chemical imbalance in the fluid in your inner ear. Read more about the causes of Ménière's disease. How Ménière's disease is treated Treatments for Ménière\u2019s disease can usually help people with the condition control their symptoms. However, current treatments aren't able to cure the condition. Possible treatments include: medicines to treat the symptoms and prevent attacks changes to your eating habits, such as a low-salt diet balance training (vestibular rehabilitation) relaxation techniques surgery, in more severe cases A number of different surgical procedures may be used to treat Ménières disease, depending on how severe the symptoms are and whether one or both ears are affected. However, the effectiveness of surgery is unclear and research is continuing. Read more about the treatment of Ménière's disease. Support and advice Some people with Ménière's disease also find that the condition affects their mental health. The unpredictable nature of the attacks and the restrictions this can place on your activities can lead to feelings of anxiety and depression. Your GP can offer advice and support if you're finding it difficult to cope with the effect Ménière's disease is having on your life. There are also a number of support groups, such as the Meniere's Society, that can provide assistance and advice. Read more about living with Ménière's disease. Information about you If you have Ménière's disease, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

The aim is to reduce the effect of fine lines and minor skin blemishes. It works on all skin types and shouldn't cause any skin colour changes or scarring. Before you go ahead\u2026 Be aware that microdermabrasion can be expensive and has its limitations. Cost: In the UK, microdermabrasion costs £40-80 for a single session. Limitations: It\u2019s not effective for scars, stretch marks, deep wrinkles or acne scars. Safety: Take time to find a reputable practitioner who is properly qualified and practises in a clean, safe and appropriate environment. Ask the practitioner what you should do if something were to go wrong. What it involves You may be given medication to relax you before the procedure begins. Local anaesthetic isn\u2019t necessary. The practitioner uses a handheld device to direct a fine stream of tiny crystals across the skin to loosen any dead cells and vacuum them away. The procedure usually takes less than 30 minutes. A course of four to six sessions may be recommended. It shouldn't be painful. Afterwards The side effects of microdermabrasion, such as redness and swelling, tend to be short-lived. Your skin may be dry and flaky for a few days after the procedure, and the suction may temporarily bruise your skin. Your face would be more sensitive to the sun afterwards, so you should avoid sun exposure for a few days and use sunscreen. What to do if you have problems If you're not happy with the results or are experiencing problems, take up the matter with your practitioner through the clinic where you were treated. If there are any complications that require medical attention, it is best that you go back to the practitioner who treated you. If this is not possible, you can go to your GP or local accident and emergency (A&E) department.

The technique can also be used medically (\"medical micropigmentation\") to recreate areas affected by a health condition or skin problem. For example, it can be used to: create an image of a nipple for women who have had a mastectomy give the illusion of hair for people with hair loss camouflage scars or areas of skin affected by vitiligo Before you go ahead\u2026 It's important to be absolutely certain before you go ahead with permanent make-up or medical micropigmentation. Here are some things to weigh up: Cost: In the UK, the cost of cosmetic micropigmentation varies from £75 for a beauty spot to £500 for lip liner. You could pay a few hundred pounds for nipple reconstruction and a few thousand pounds for scalp coverage. Limitations: It may fade a little every year (some people decide to pay extra to maintain the look). There\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll achieve the desired effect. Mistakes are hard to fix (you'll need to undergo laser or chemical tattoo removal). Styles change \u2013 thick, well-defined eyebrows, for example, may not be so fashionable in five years time. Safety: Providers of micropigmentation don't have to be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which is the independent regulator for health services in England. You should find a reputable practitioner who practises in a clean, safe and appropriate environment, with the processes in place to deal with any complications. Check their qualifications and training. Medical micropigmentation requires specific training, so make sure the practitioner is properly qualified if you choose this, and check with your doctor that it won\u2019t interfere with any planned treatment. You shouldn\u2019t consider micropigmentation if you\u2019re prone to keloid scarring. What it involves Consultation You should have a thorough consultation beforehand to discuss what type of look you would like to achieve and to agree the colour, position and shape of the desired effect. Find out about the process that would be followed if something were to go wrong. Take time to reflect on your decision. A patch test should also be done, to make sure you're not allergic to the pigment. On the day A local anaesthetic cream would be applied to the skin to numb it. The skin would then be sketched with a surgical pen. A sterile single-use needle would be inserted underneath the upper layers of skin to deposit pigmented granules. The pigment is usually iron oxide, which is least likely to cause allergic reactions and bleeding. Each time the needle is inserted, a droplet of pigment is released into the tiny hole created. You may feel a slight stinging. The procedure takes about one hour. You'll usually need two applications spaced four to six weeks apart, and \"maintenance\" or \"top-up\" treatments after one to three years, which will cost extra. Afterwards Your practitioner will apply a barrier cream. You\u2019ll be advised to apply this twice daily if you feel the area drying out and repeat this for up to 14 days, or until the area has fully healed. The area may feel itchy or be quite dry while it is healing. Initially, the colour may appear very intense. It takes about four weeks for the colour to fade to its permanent shade. The surrounding area may be red and a little swollen immediately after treatment and (depending on the procedure) for a few days afterwards. There may be a few spots of blood on the first day. You'll need to avoid direct jets from the shower or soaking in the bath for too long, as this may remove the pigment or increase the risk of infection. You'll also need to steer clear of chlorinated water (such as swimming pools) and exposure to sunlight until it has fully healed. It can take about two weeks to fully heal, after which time you'd be able to carry out your usual routine and use beauty products. Risks Possible risks of micropigmentation are: disappointing results (mistakes can be hard to fix) infection a skin reaction, such as swelling, cracking, peeling or blistering granulomas \u2013 tiny lumps that form under the skin around the pigment scarring, or overgrowths of scar tissue an allergic reaction to the pigment \u2013 but this is rare, as the patch test would usually pick this up MRI complications \u2013 rarely, some people have experienced swelling or burning in the tattooed area after having an MRI scan What to do if you have problems You should look out for problems with healing or skin pigmentation changes. If you have any symptoms or complications that require medical attention, it is best that you go back to the practitioner who treated you. If this is not possible, you can go to your GP or local accident and emergency (A&E) department.

Inflammation is your immune system's response to tissue that has become injured or infected. Damaged cells release chemicals that cause blood vessels to leak fluid into the tissues, causing tissue swelling. If there's an infection, this helps isolate the invading germ.  In vasculitis, your immune system attacks the blood vessels by mistake. The trigger may be an infection, a medicine or another medical condition. Sometimes, however, the cause isn't clear. It leads to swollen blood vessel walls and narrowed blood vessels. Blood flow to tissues and organs is reduced or blocked. If the blood vessel wall becomes weak, bleeding can occur. Any blood vessel can become inflamed like this, from large arteries (\"arteritis\") to small blood vessels, in any place in the body. The larger the blood vessels affected, the more damage there may be. All these variables mean there are many possible types of vasculitis, each with different symptoms and potential complications. These are covered below (ordered by size of the affected blood vessels): Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) Polymyalgia rheumatica  Takayasu arteritis  Polyarteritis nodosa  Kawasaki disease Granulomatosis with polyangiitis  Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis  Microscopic polyangiitis Henoch\u2013Schönlein purpura  Less common types  These types of vasculitis are briefly explained below, with links taking you to more detailed information. Giant cell arteritis Giant cell arteritis is an age-related condition in which medium and large arteries, usually in the head and neck, become inflamed. It's sometimes called \"temporal arteritis\", because the arteries around the temples are often affected. Symptoms of giant cell arteritis include: aching and soreness around the temples jaw muscle pain while eating vision loss It tends to only affect adults over the age of 50, and the cause is unclear. The main treatment is steroid medication (usually prednisolone), which is given promptly when the diagnosis is suspected.  Read more about giant cell arteritis. Polymyalgia rheumatica  Polymyalgia rheumatica is another age-related condition closely related to giant cell arteritis. It causes pain, stiffness and inflammation in the muscles around the shoulders, neck and hips. It may also cause more general symptoms, such as a fever, extreme tiredness, loss of appetite, weight loss and depression. The condition is two to three times more common in women than men, and most people diagnosed with it are over 70 years old. The cause is unclear.  The main treatment is usually prednisolone (a steroid medication), which is usually used in lower doses than for giant cell arteritis.  Read more about polymyalgia rheumatica. Takayasu arteritis Takayasu arteritis is rare in the UK. The main artery from the heart is affected, along with the major arteries branching off this. These arteries gradually narrow over time, which reduces the blood supply to the limbs and other parts of the body. Treatment is usually steroid medication. Read information about Takayasu arteritis from Vasculitis UK. Polyarteritis nodosa Polyarteritis nodosa is a rare form of vasculitis, in which the medium or smaller arteries become damaged and inflamed. It particularly affects the arteries supplying the gut, kidneys and nerves. Sometimes, only part of the artery wall is affected, which becomes weak and may bulge, forming an aneurysm. If this leaks or ruptures, it can cause serious internal bleeding. Polyarteritis nodosa can also affect the whole wall of the artery at a particular point, and cause a blockage. The condition is potentially very serious. Typical symptoms are feeling unwell with fever, skin rashes, tummy aches, nerve damage and weight loss. Polyarteritis nodosa can sometimes be triggered by an infection, but the exact cause is uncertain. Read information about polyarteritis nodosa from the Great Ormond Street Hospital website. Kawasaki disease Kawasaki disease is a rare condition that affects small and medium arteries in children under the age of five.  The characteristic symptoms of Kawasaki disease are a high temperature that lasts for more than five days, with a rash, swollen glands in the neck, red fingers or toes, red eyes and redness of the lips, tongue or mouth. Kawasaki disease can affect the coronary arteries (the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart), so some children with Kawasaki disease experience heart complications. The trigger is thought to be an infection, although the exact cause is not fully understood. The affected child will usually need to be managed in hospital, because of the risk of complications \u2013 they will need to be carefully assessed for heart problems and treated with immunoglobulins and aspirin. Read more about Kawasaki disease. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis)  Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is an uncommon disorder that mainly affects the blood vessels in the nose, sinuses, ears, lungs and kidneys. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fever, night sweats, sinusitis, nosebleeds and crusting of the nose, shortness of breath, coughing up blood and kidney impairment. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a serious condition that can be fatal if left untreated, because it can lead to tissue damage and organ failure. High doses of drugs are needed to dampen down the immune system and bring the inflammation under control. Typically, it is treated with steroid medications (prednisone) and cyclophosphamide \u2013 a cancer drug that suppresses the immune system. Read more about granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg\u2013Strauss syndrome) Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a type of vasculitis that typically causes allergic sinusitis and asthma to develop in adults. It mainly affects adults aged 30-45. Many of the other symptoms are general and include fever, muscle and joint aches, tiredness, loss of appetite and weight loss. The condition can also affect the nerves, causing weakness, pins and needles or numbness, and it sometimes damages the heart muscle. Read information about Eosinophilic granulomatosis from Vasculitis UK. Microscopic polyangiitis Microscopic polyangiitis is another rare and potentially serious long-term vasculitis. Inflammation of the blood vessel walls may affect any organ, but particularly the lungs, kidneys and nervous system. It can lead to raised blood pressure, kidney impairment, anaemia, breathlessness and coughing up blood.  Read information from the Oxford University Hospitals NHS website about microscopic polyangiitis. Henoch\u2013Schönlein purpura (HSP) Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a rare condition, usually seen in children, which results in a skin rash and joint and tummy pain. It can follow a recent infection. Inflammation of the blood vessels can cause the small surface blood vessels to bleed into the skin, which results in a characteristic rash (purpura). Joint pain is also common. HSP can also affect blood vessels in the bowel and the kidneys, and can cause tummy pain and visible blood in the urine or stools. HSP usually gets better without treatment and is not usually serious. Read more about Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Less common types of vasculitis  Behçet's disease \u2013 typically results in mouth ulcers and genital ulcers, and is more common in people from Greece, Turkey, the Middle East, China and Japan Buerger's disease (links to the Vasculitis UK website) \u2013 affects vessels in the legs and arms, leading to reduced blood flow to the hands and feet Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (links to the Vasculitis UK website) \u2013 inflammation of the brain's blood vessels Cogan's Syndrome (links to the Vasculitis UK website) \u2013 inflammation of the inner ears and eyes Cryoglobulin-associated vasculitis (links to the Vasculitis UK website) \u2013 associated with cryoglobulins (proteins in the blood that stick together in the cold); can cause a rash on the lower limbs, joint pain or arthritis, nerve damage, abdominal pain and kidney failure Hypersensitivity vasculitis (links to Vasculitis UK website) \u2013 most commonly caused by sensitivity to a drug such as penicillin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or the contraceptive pill, and results in a skin rash  Vasculitis caused by rheumatoid arthritis (links to the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society) The links take you to more information on these rarer types of vasculitis.

But occasionally they can become infected, cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or spread serious illnesses such as Lyme disease and malaria. Bugs that bite or sting include wasps, hornets, bees, horseflies, ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, spiders and midges. This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you've been bitten or stung When to get medical advice When to get emergency medical help Prevention Symptoms of insect bites and stings Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Some people have a mild allergic reaction and a larger area of skin around the bite or sting becomes swollen, red and painful. This should pass within a week. Occasionally, a severe allergic reaction can occur, causing symptoms such as breathing difficulties, dizziness and a swollen face or mouth. This requires immediate medical treatment (see below). Read more about the symptoms of common insect bites and stings. What to do if you've been bitten or stung To treat an insect bite or sting: Remove the sting or tick if it's still in the skin (see treating insect bites and stings for advice about how to do this safely). Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they're unlikely to help. The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. Ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments that can help, such as painkillers, creams for itching and antihistamines. Read more about treatments for insect bites and stings. When to get medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if: you're worried about a bite or sting your symptoms don't start to improve within a few days or are getting worse you've been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes a large area (around 10cm or more) around the bite becomes red and swollen you have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness you have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a fever, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms When to get emergency medical help Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe reaction, such as: wheezing or difficulty breathing a swollen face, mouth or throat nausea or vomiting a fast heart rate dizziness or feeling faint difficulty swallowing loss of consciousness Emergency treatment in hospital is needed in these cases. Prevent insect bites and stings There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin \u2013 repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants \u2013 these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. You may need to take extra precautions if you're travelling to part of the world where there's a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about how to prevent insect bites and stings.

But most aren't serious and are easily treated. In many cases, you can treat your headaches at home with over-the-counter painkillers and lifestyle changes, such as getting more rest and drinking enough fluids. However, it's a good idea to see your GP if your headaches aren't relieved by over-the-counter treatments, or if they're so painful or frequent that they affect your daily activities or are causing you to miss work. This page covers: Tension headaches Migraines Cluster headaches Medication and painkiller headaches Hormone headaches Other causes of headaches Signs of a serious problem Tension headaches Tension headaches are the most common type of headache and are what we think of as normal, \"everyday\" headaches. They feel like a constant ache that affects both sides of the head, as though a tight band is stretched around it. A tension headache normally won't be severe enough to prevent you doing everyday activities. They usually last for 30 minutes to several hours, but can last for several days. The exact cause is unclear, but tension headaches have been linked to things such as stress, poor posture, skipping meals and dehydration. Tension headaches can usually be treated with ordinary painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen. Lifestyle changes, such as getting regular sleep, reducing stress and staying well hydrated, may also help. Read more about tension headaches. Migraines Migraines are less common than tension headaches. They're usually felt as a severe, throbbing pain at the front or side of the head. Some people also have other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and increased sensitivity to light or sound. Migraines tend to be more severe than tension headaches and can stop you carrying out your normal daily activities. They usually last at least a couple of hours, and some people find they need to stay in bed for days at a time. Most people can treat their migraines successfully with over-the-counter medication. But if they're severe, you may need stronger medication that's only available on prescription. This may be able to relieve and prevent your migraines. Read more about migraines. Cluster headaches Cluster headaches are a rare type of headache that occur in clusters for a month or two at a time around the same time of year. They're excruciatingly painful, causing intense pain around one eye, and often occur with other symptoms, such as a watering or red eye and a blocked or runny nose. Pharmacy medications don't ease the symptoms of a cluster headache, but a doctor can prescribe specific treatments to ease the pain and help prevent further attacks. Read more about cluster headaches. Medication and painkiller headaches Some headaches are a side effect of taking a particular medication. Frequent headaches can also be caused by taking too many painkillers. This is known as a painkiller or medication-overuse headache. A medication-overuse headache will usually get better within a few weeks once you stop taking the painkillers that are causing it, although your pain may get worse for a few days before it starts to improve. Read more about painkiller headaches. Hormone headaches Headaches in women are often caused by hormones, and many women notice a link with their periods. The combined contraceptive pill, the menopause and pregnancy are also potential triggers. Reducing your stress levels, having a regular sleeping pattern, and ensuring you don't miss meals may help reduce headaches associated with your menstrual cycle. Read more about hormone headaches. Other causes of headaches Headaches can also have a number of other causes, including: drinking too much alcohol a head injury or concussion a cold or flu temporomandibular disorders \u2013 problems affecting the \"chewing\" muscles and the joints between the lower jaw and the base of the skull sinusitis \u2013 inflammation of the lining of the sinuses; read more about sinus headaches carbon monoxide poisoning sleep apnoea \u2013 a condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing Click on the links above for more information about these conditions. Could it be something serious? In the vast majority of cases, a headache isn't a sign of a serious problem. But, rarely, it can be a symptom of a condition such as a stroke, meningitis, or a brain tumour. A headache is more likely to be serious if: it occurs suddenly and is very severe \u2013 often described as a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before it doesn't go away and gets worse over time it occurs after a severe head injury it's triggered suddenly by coughing, laughing, sneezing, changes in posture, or physical exertion you have symptoms suggesting a problem with your brain or nervous system, including weakness, slurred speech, confusion, memory loss, and drowsiness you have additional symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever), a stiff neck, a rash, jaw pain while chewing, vision problems, a sore scalp, or severe pain and redness in one of your eyes If you're concerned that your headache might be serious, you should seek immediate medical advice. Contact your GP or NHS 111 as soon as possible, or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department.

Prickly heat can develop anywhere on the body, but it usually appears on your face, neck, back, chest or thighs a few days after exposure to hot temperatures. The rash is made up of tiny spots or bumps that are surrounded by an area of red skin. The spots sometimes look like tiny blisters and can cause: mild swelling itching a stinging or intense prickling sensation Causes of prickly heat Prickly heat usually develops when a person sweats more than usual, such as during hot or humid weather. However, it's also possible to get prickly heat in the winter. The condition is caused when the body's sweat glands become blocked. Excessive sweating can result in sweat becoming trapped beneath your skin. The trapped sweat causes skin irritation and the characteristic heat rash. The symptoms of prickly heat are usually worse in areas that are covered by clothing. This is because clothing can make you sweat and sometimes causes friction (rubbing). Who gets prickly heat? Although anyone can get prickly heat, you're more at risk of developing it if you're in a hot climate where you sweat more than usual. The following also increase your risk: illness and immobility \u2013 long periods of time spent in bed can make you sweat more, particularly if you have warm bedding wearing too much clothing, particularly in the winter sitting too close to a fire or heater being overweight or obese \u2013 which is more likely to lead to excessive sweating Babies and children are also more at risk of getting prickly heat, because their sweat glands aren't fully developed. Treating prickly heat Prickly heat isn't a serious condition and rarely requires any specific treatment. The rash usually disappears after a few days. However, there are several things you can do to ease your symptoms: Avoid excessive heat and humidity \u2013 if you need to go outside, spend time in the shade or take a small fan with you. Further exposure to the heat will cause you to sweat more and may make your rash worse. Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration, especially in hot weather. Wear loose cotton clothing \u2013 avoid wearing synthetic fibres, such as polyester and nylon, which trap heat easier than natural fibres. Keep your skin cool \u2013 a cool bath or shower will cool you down, soothe your skin and help prevent further sweating. Staying in an air-conditioned room for a few hours a day will also provide considerable relief. You can also use a cold compress, but don't leave it on the skin for longer than 20 minutes. Use calamine lotion \u2013 this is available at most pharmacies and will help soothe sore and irritated skin. Try hydrocortisone cream \u2013 low-strength hydrocortisone cream is also available from pharmacies and is effective at treating very itchy and irritated areas of skin. However, avoid using it on your face and always follow the instructions. Antihistamine tablets may help control itching \u2013 but consult your GP first as they're not always suitable Read more about staying safe in the sun. Babies and rashes If your baby has a rash and appears to be unwell, you should visit your GP or contact NHS 111. Prickly heat is common in babies and doesn't cause any serious harm. However, if you're concerned, your GP will be able to confirm the cause of your baby's rash and give appropriate treatment. Read more about skin rashes in babies.

Symptoms of lactose intolerance usually develop within a few hours of consuming food or drink that contains lactose. They may include: flatulence (wind) diarrhoea bloated stomach stomach cramps and pains stomach rumbling feeling sick The severity of your symptoms and when they appear depends on the amount of lactose you've consumed. Some people may still be able to drink a small glass of milk without triggering any symptoms, while others may not even be able to have milk in their tea or coffee. When to seek medical advice The symptoms of lactose intolerance can be similar to several other conditions, so it's important to see your GP for a diagnosis before removing milk and dairy products from your diet. For example, the symptoms above can also be caused by: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \u2013 a long-term disorder that affects the digestive system milk protein intolerance \u2013 an adverse reaction to the protein in milk from cows (not the same as a milk allergy) If your GP thinks you have lactose intolerance, they may suggest avoiding foods and drinks containing lactose for two weeks to see if your symptoms improve. Read more about diagnosing lactose intolerance. What causes lactose intolerance? The body digests lactose using a substance called lactase. This breaks down lactose into two sugars called glucose and galactose, which can be easily absorbed into the bloodstream. People with lactose intolerance don't produce enough lactase, so lactose stays in the digestive system where it's fermented by bacteria. This leads to the production of various gases, which cause the symptoms associated with lactose intolerance. Depending on the underlying reason why the body isn't producing enough lactase, lactose intolerance may be temporary or permanent. Most cases that develop in adults are inherited and tend to be lifelong, but cases in young children are often caused by an infection in the digestive system and may only last for a few weeks. Read more about the causes of lactose intolerance. Who's affected? In the UK, lactose intolerance is more common in people of Asian or African-Caribbean descent. Lactose intolerance can develop at any age. Many cases first develop in people aged 20 to 40, although babies and young children can also be affected. Is it an allergy? Lactose intolerance isn't the same as a milk or dairy allergy. Food allergies are caused by your immune system reacting to a certain type of food. This causes symptoms such as a rash, wheezing and itching. If you're allergic to something, even a tiny particle can be enough to trigger a reaction, while most people with lactose intolerance can still consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing any problems (although this varies from person to person). Treating lactose intolerance There's no cure for lactose intolerance, but limiting your intake of food and drink containing lactose usually helps to control the symptoms. Depending on what dairy products you're able to eat, you may also require additional calcium and vitamin D supplements to keep your bones strong and healthy. In some cases, your GP may refer you to a dietitian for further advice. In addition to dietary changes, lactase substitutes may also be helpful. These are drops or tablets you can take with your meals or drinks to improve your digestion of lactose. Read more about treating lactose intolerance. Complications of lactose intolerance Milk and other dairy products contain calcium, protein and vitamins such as A, B12 and D. Lactose also helps your body absorb a number of other minerals, such as magnesium and zinc. These vitamins and minerals are important for the development of strong, healthy bones. If you're lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. This may lead to unhealthy weight loss and put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions: Osteopenia \u2013 where you have a very low bone-mineral density. If osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis. Osteoporosis \u2013 where your bones become thin and weak. If you have osteoporosis, your risk of getting fractures and broken bones is increased. Malnutrition \u2013 when the food you eat doesn't give you the nutrients essential for a healthy functioning body. If you're malnourished, wounds can take longer to heal and you may start to feel tired or depressed. If you're concerned that dietary restrictions are putting you at risk of complications, you may find it helpful to consult a dietitian. They can advise you on your diet and whether you require food supplements. Your GP should be able to refer you to an NHS dietitian free of charge. Alternatively, you can contact a private dietician. The British Dietetic Association has information on how to find a private dietitian.

Consciousness requires both wakefulness and awareness. Wakefulness is the ability to open your eyes and have basic reflexes such as coughing, swallowing and sucking. Awareness is associated with more complex thought processes and is more difficult to assess. Currently, the assessment of awareness relies on physical responses being detected during an examination. The main disorders of consciousness are: coma vegetative state minimally conscious state Coma A coma is when a person shows no signs of being awake and no signs of being aware. A person in a coma lies with their eyes closed and doesn't respond to their environment, voices or pain. A coma usually lasts for less than two to four weeks, during which time a person may wake up or progress into a vegetative state or minimally conscious state. Read more about comas. Vegetative state A vegetative state is when a person is awake but is showing no signs of awareness. A person in a vegetative state may open their eyes, wake up and fall asleep at regular intervals and have basic reflexes, such as blinking when they're startled by a loud noise, or withdrawing their hand when it's squeezed hard. They're also able to regulate their heartbeat and breathing without assistance. However, a person in a vegetative state doesn't show any meaningful responses, such as following an object with their eyes or responding to voices. They also show no signs of experiencing emotions. If a person is in a vegetative state for a long time, it may be considered to be: a continuing vegetative state \u2013 when it's been longer than four weeks a permanent vegetative state \u2013 when it's been more than six months if caused by a non-traumatic brain injury, or more than 12 months if caused by a traumatic brain injury If a person is diagnosed as being in a permanent vegetative state, recovery is extremely unlikely but not impossible. Minimally conscious state A person who shows clear but minimal or inconsistent awareness is classified as being in a minimally conscious state. They may have periods where they can communicate or respond to commands, such as moving a finger when asked. A person may enter a minimally conscious state after being in a coma or vegetative state. In some cases a minimally conscious state is a stage on the route to recovery, but in others it's permanent. As with vegetative state, a continuing minimally conscious state means it has lasted longer than four weeks. However, it's more difficult to diagnose a permanent minimally conscious state because it depends on things such as: the type of brain injury how severe the injury is how responsive the person is In most cases, a minimally conscious state isn't usually considered to be permanent until it's lasted several years. Why they happen Disorders of consciousness can occur if the parts of the brain involved with consciousness are damaged. These types of brain injury can be divided into: traumatic brain injury \u2013 the result of a severe head injury, such as an injury sustained during a car accident or a fall from a great height non-traumatic brain injury \u2013 where the injury to the brain is caused by a health condition, such as a stroke progressive brain damage \u2013 where the brain is gradually damaged over time; for example, because of Alzheimer's disease Read more about the causes of disorders of consciousness. Making a diagnosis A disorder of consciousness will only be confirmed after extensive testing to determine the person's level of wakefulness and awareness. These examinations need to be carried out by someone experienced in disorders of consciousness, although the views of other healthcare professionals and family members should also be taken into consideration. For some states of impaired consciousness, such as vegetative state and minimally conscious state, there are recommended criteria to help confirm a diagnosis. Read more about diagnosing disorders of consciousness. Treatment and care Treatment can't ensure recovery from a state of impaired consciousness. Instead, supportive treatment is used to give the best chance of natural improvement. This can involve: providing nutrition through a feeding tube  making sure the person is moved regularly so they don't develop pressure ulcers gently exercising their joints to prevent them becoming tight keeping their skin clean managing their bowel and bladder \u2013 for example, using a tube known as a catheter to drain the bladder keeping their teeth and mouth clean offering opportunities for periods of meaningful activity \u2013 such as listening to music or watching television, being shown pictures or hearing family members talking Sensory stimulation In some cases, a treatment called sensory stimulation may be used in an attempt to increase responsiveness. This involves stimulating the main senses, such as vision, hearing and smell. It's usually carried out by a trained specialist, but family members are often encouraged to be involved. Some examples of sensory stimulation include: visual \u2013 showing photos of friends and family, or a favourite film hearing \u2013 talking or playing a favourite song smell \u2013 putting flowers in the room or spraying a favourite perfume touch \u2013 holding their hand or stroking their skin with different fabrics It's not entirely clear how effective sensory stimulation is, but it's sometimes considered worthwhile.  Recovery It's impossible to predict the chances of someone in a state of impaired consciousness improving. It largely depends on: the type of brain injury how severe the injury is the person's age how long they've been in the state for Some people improve gradually, whereas others stay in a state of impaired consciousness for years. Many people never recover consciousness. There are only isolated cases of people recovering consciousness after several years. The few people who do regain consciousness after this time often have severe disabilities caused by the damage to their brain. Withdrawing nutritional support If a person has been in a vegetative state for a minimum of 12 months, it may be recommended that nutritional support is withdrawn. This is because: there's almost no chance of a recovery by this point prolonging life would have no benefit for the person concerned prolonging treatment could offer false hope and cause unnecessary emotional distress for the friends and family of the person concerned The medical team will discuss the issue with family members, but the decision has to be referred to the courts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland before any further action can be taken. In Scotland a court ruling isn't required, but is often sought. If the court agrees with the decision, a palliative care team will usually be involved in planning the withdrawal. Once nutritional support is eventually withdrawn, the person will die within a few days or weeks. Locked-in syndrome Locked-in syndrome has similar features to disorders of consciousness, but is considered and treated differently.  A person with locked-in syndrome is both conscious and aware, but completely paralysed and unable to speak. They're usually able to move their eyes and are sometimes able to communicate by blinking.

The disruption in blood supply results in a lack of oxygen to the brain. This can cause sudden symptoms similar to those of a stroke, such as speech and visual disturbance, and numbness or weakness in the face, arms and legs. However, a TIA does not last as long as a stroke. The effects often only last for a few minutes or hours and fully resolve within 24 hours. Signs and symptoms The main symptoms of a TIA can be remembered with the word FAST: Face-Arms-Speech-Time. Face \u2013 the face may have dropped on one side, the person may not be able to smile, or their mouth or eye may have dropped. Arms \u2013 the person with suspected stroke may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm. Speech \u2013 their speech may be slurred or garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all, despite appearing to be awake. Time \u2013 it is time to dial 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms. Read more about the symptoms of a TIA. Seeking medical advice In the early stages of a TIA, it's not possible to tell whether you are having a TIA or a full stroke, so it's important to phone 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Even if the symptoms disappear while you are waiting for the ambulance to arrive, an assessment in hospital should still be carried out. A TIA is a warning that you are at risk of having a full stroke in the near future, and an assessment can help doctors to determine the best way to reduce the chances of this happening. If you think you may have had a TIA previously, but the symptoms have since passed and you didn't seek medical advice at the time, you should make an urgent appointment with your GP so they can determine whether to refer you for a hospital assessment. Read more about diagnosing a TIA. What causes TIAs? During a TIA, one of the blood vessels that supply your brain with oxygen-rich blood becomes blocked. This blockage is usually caused by a blood clot that has formed elsewhere in your body and travelled to the blood vessels supplying the brain, although it can also be caused by pieces of fatty material or air bubbles. Certain things can increase your chances of having a TIA, including: smoking having high blood pressure (hypertension) being obese having high cholesterol levels regularly drinking an excessive amount of alcohol having atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heartbeat) having diabetes People over 60 years of age, and people of Asian, African or Caribbean descent are also at a higher risk of having a TIA. Read more about the causes of TIA. How TIAs are treated Although the symptoms of a TIA resolve in a few minutes or hours, you will need treatment to help prevent another TIA or a full stroke happening in the future. Your treatment will depend on your individual circumstances, such as your age and medical history. You are likely to be given advice about lifestyle changes you can make to reduce your stroke risk (see below), in addition to being offered medication to treat the underlying cause of your TIA. In some cases, surgery may be needed to unblock the carotid arteries (the main blood vessels that supply the brain with blood). Read more about treating a TIA. Preventing TIAs A TIA is often a sign that another one may follow and you are at a high risk of having a full, life-threatening stroke in the near future. Regardless of whether or not you have had a TIA or stroke in the past, there are a number of ways you can lower your risk of having either in the future. These include: maintaining a healthy weight eating healthily taking regular exercise limiting your alcohol consumption not smoking Read more about how lifestyle factors can help to prevent a TIA.

The main sign of a miscarriage is vaginal bleeding, which may be followed by cramping and pain in your lower abdomen. If you have vaginal bleeding, contact your GP or midwife. Most GPs can refer you to an early pregnancy unit at your local hospital straight away if necessary. You may be referred to a maternity ward if your pregnancy is at a later stage. However, bear in mind that light vaginal bleeding is relatively common during the first trimester of pregnancy (the first 12 weeks) and doesn't necessarily mean you're having a miscarriage. Read more about the symptoms of miscarriage. What causes a miscarriage? There are probably many reasons why a miscarriage may happen, although the cause isn't usually identified. The majority aren't caused by anything the mother has done. It's thought most miscarriages are caused by abnormal chromosomes in the baby. Chromosomes are genetic \"building blocks\" that guide the development of a baby. If a baby has too many or not enough chromosomes, it won't develop properly. If a miscarriage happens during the second trimester of pregnancy (between weeks 14 and 26), it's sometimes the result of an underlying health condition in the mother. For most women, a miscarriage is a one-off event and they go on to have a successful pregnancy in the future. Read more about what causes a miscarriage. Can miscarriages be prevented? The majority of miscarriages can't be prevented. If a woman has suffered from more than three miscarriages, some women can be helped to keep their pregnancy with medication under the care of a specialist. However, there are some things you can do to reduce the risk of a miscarriage. Avoid smoking, drinking alcohol and using drugs while pregnant. Being a healthy weight before getting pregnant, eating a healthy diet and reducing your risk of infection can also help. Read more about preventing miscarriages. What happens if you think you're having a miscarriage? If you have the symptoms of a miscarriage, you'll usually be referred to a hospital for tests. In most cases, an ultrasound scan can determine whether the pregnancy is ongoing or you're having a miscarriage. When a miscarriage is confirmed, you'll need to talk to your doctor or nurse about the options for the management of the end of the pregnancy. In the majority of cases, the pregnancy tissue will pass out naturally in a week or two. Sometimes medication to assist the passage of the tissue may be recommended, or you can choose to have minor surgery to remove it if you don't want to wait. Read more about diagnosing a miscarriage and what happens if you have a miscarriage. After a miscarriage A miscarriage can be an emotionally and physically draining experience. You may have feelings of guilt, shock and anger. Advice and support is available at this time from hospital counselling services and charity groups. You may also find it beneficial to have a memorial for your lost baby. You can try for another baby as soon as your symptoms have settled and you've had one period, although you should ensure you're emotionally and physically ready first. Having a miscarriage doesn't necessarily mean you'll have another if you get pregnant again. Most women are able to have a healthy pregnancy after a miscarriage, even in cases of recurrent miscarriages. Read more about what happens after a miscarriage. How common are miscarriages? Miscarriages are much more common than most people realise. Among women who know they're pregnant, it's estimated one in six of these pregnancies will end in miscarriage. Many more miscarriages occur before a woman is even aware she has become pregnant. Losing three or more pregnancies in a row (recurrent miscarriages) is uncommon and only affects around 1 in 100 women. Miscarriage Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

But occasionally they can become infected, cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or spread serious illnesses such as Lyme disease and malaria. Bugs that bite or sting include wasps, hornets, bees, horseflies, ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, spiders and midges. This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you've been bitten or stung When to get medical advice When to get emergency medical help Prevention Symptoms of insect bites and stings Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Some people have a mild allergic reaction and a larger area of skin around the bite or sting becomes swollen, red and painful. This should pass within a week. Occasionally, a severe allergic reaction can occur, causing symptoms such as breathing difficulties, dizziness and a swollen face or mouth. This requires immediate medical treatment (see below). Read more about the symptoms of common insect bites and stings. What to do if you've been bitten or stung To treat an insect bite or sting: Remove the sting or tick if it's still in the skin (see treating insect bites and stings for advice about how to do this safely). Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they're unlikely to help. The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. Ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments that can help, such as painkillers, creams for itching and antihistamines. Read more about treatments for insect bites and stings. When to get medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if: you're worried about a bite or sting your symptoms don't start to improve within a few days or are getting worse you've been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes a large area (around 10cm or more) around the bite becomes red and swollen you have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness you have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a fever, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms When to get emergency medical help Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe reaction, such as: wheezing or difficulty breathing a swollen face, mouth or throat nausea or vomiting a fast heart rate dizziness or feeling faint difficulty swallowing loss of consciousness Emergency treatment in hospital is needed in these cases. Prevent insect bites and stings There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin \u2013 repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants \u2013 these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. You may need to take extra precautions if you're travelling to part of the world where there's a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about how to prevent insect bites and stings.

During each heartbeat, the smaller upper chambers of the heart (atria) contract to push blood into the larger lower chambers (ventricles). The mitral valve opens to allow this passage of blood from the left atrium, and closes when the left ventricle is full of blood, to prevent backflow. When the valve closes, its two leaflets (flaps) normally seal the valve shut. Tendons attached to these flaps keep them taut and prevent them collapsing through to the other side. Problems affecting the mitral valve Problems with the mitral valve can make the heart less efficient at pumping blood around the body. Severe problems can lead to heart failure (where the heart can no longer pump enough blood around the body) if the valve is not surgically repaired or replaced. Common mitral valve problems are: mitral regurgitation (also called 'mitral incompetence') \u2013 where there is a backflow of blood through the valve, often as a result of a problem called mitral valve prolapse (where the valve collapses) mitral stenosis \u2013 where the valve doesn't open as wide as it should, restricting blood flow These conditions can occur alone or in combination. They are covered in more detail below. Mitral regurgitation Mitral regurgitation means there is a backflow of blood from the left ventricle to the left atrium when the heart contracts during a heartbeat. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, tiredness, dizziness and chest pain, and it can lead to atrial fibrillation (a condition that causes an irregular and often abnormally fast heart rate), pulmonary hypertension (high pressure inside the vessels carrying blood from the heart to the lungs) and heart failure. Mitral regurgitation can happen when the mitral valve flaps fail to seal shut, either because of problems with the flaps (such as a mitral valve prolapse \u2013 see below) or due to widening of the mitral annulus, which is the ring of muscle surrounding the valve. These problems are more common in older people and are often the result of changes to the heart with age. For example, the mitral valve may become weaker due to 'wear and tear' or damage caused by persistent high blood pressure. Occasionally, mitral regurgitation can occur as a result of rheumatic heart disease (a complication of rheumatic fever), cardiomyopathy (a disease of the heart muscle), endocarditis (infection of the inner lining of the heart), or congenital heart disease (birth defects affecting the normal workings of the heart). If regurgitation is only mild, you may just be monitored at regular intervals with echocardiography (an scan of the heart) to check your heart function. If you have moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, you'll probably need surgery to repair or replace the valve (see below). You may also need medications called nitrates or diuretics to reduce symptoms such as shortness of breath, and medication to treat atrial fibrillation. If you have severe mitral regurgitation and you are not suitable for surgery, or you are still having problems after surgery, you may be offered medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers to help manage the condition. Mitral valve prolapse Mitral valve prolapse means that one or more of the mitral flaps are floppy and don't close tightly, often leading to backflow of blood (mitral regurgitation \u2013 see above). Most people with a mitral valve prolapse will not have symptoms, unless the problem causes severe mitral regurgitation, and it is usually discovered by chance during echocardiography (an ultrasound scan of the heart) carried out for a different reason. Occasionally, however, mitral valve prolapse can cause problems such as arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat) and palpitations (sudden, noticeable heartbeats). Mitral valve prolapse can be caused by problems with the connective tissues (chords) that join the mitral valve to the heart muscles or, more rarely, by damage to the heart muscles themselves as the result of a heart attack. Some people with the condition are born with it and it's more common in people with connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome. If mitral valve prolapse isn't causing any symptoms and you are at low risk of developing severe mitral regurgitation, you won't need surgical treatment. Mild symptoms can sometimes be controlled with lifestyle changes, such as giving up cigarettes, caffeine and alcohol, because these can cause your heart to become overstimulated.  Surgical repair or replacement of the valve (see below) may be recommended if you have: severe mitral regurgitation causing symptoms no symptoms but an enlarged lower heart chamber severe mitral regurgitation with atrial fibrillation or pulmonary hypertension Mitral valve stenosis Mitral valve stenosis occurs when the mitral valve doesn't open as wide as it should, restricting the flow of blood through the heart. As a result, less blood can get to the body and the upper heart chamber swells as pressure builds up. Blood and fluid can also collect in the lungs, making it hard for you to breathe. The most common cause of mitral valve stenosis in adults is rheumatic fever, which can occur five to 10 years before the heart valve problems began. Rheumatic fever causes the valve to become inflamed (swollen), and over time the flaps of the inflamed valve stick together and become scarred, rigid and thickened. Rarer causes of mitral valve stenosis include calcium deposits forming around the valve, radiation treatment to the chest and some medications. Mitral valve stenosis may not cause any symptoms, but common warning signs include shortness of breath and an abnormally fast heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation). If you don't have any symptoms, your heart function may just be monitored at regular intervals with echocardiography (an ultrasound scan of the heart). Some people will be offered medications called nitrates or diuretics to reduce the build-up of fluid in the lungs, medication to treat atrial fibrillation and medication to prevent blood clots. If you have symptoms, you're at risk of heart failure if you do not have an operation either to open up the valve (percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty) or have it replaced. See below for more information about these procedures. Left untreated, moderate to severe mitral stenosis can lead to heart failure. Surgery for mitral valve problems  If you have a severe case of mitral regurgitation, mitral valve prolapse or mitral valve stenosis, you will usually need to have a heart valve operation. Most heart valve operations are performed under general anaesthetic (where you are asleep). They usually involve making a cut down the middle of the breastbone, although some surgeons are increasingly carrying out these operations using small incisions between the ribs (a 'minimal access' approach).  Sometimes it's possible to perform the surgery using a 'percutaneous' method, which involves feeding a catheter (thin, flexible tube) into a large vein in your neck or groin and guiding this through to your heart. People tend to recover more quickly from this procedure, but the results are often less predictable. The most common mitral valve procedures are: mitral valve repair surgery mitral valve replacement surgery percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty These procedures are briefly explained below, but your surgeon or heart specialist will explain any operation in detail to you, including the risks and benefits. It is also possible to carry out procedures similar to mitral valve repair using percutaneous techniques, but these are not covered in any detail here because they not widely used and there are still some uncertainties about them. For more information, you can read: NICE guidelines on percutaneous mitral valve repair for mitral regurgitation  NICE guidelines on percutaneous mitral valve annuloplasty  Mitral valve repair surgery  Repairing the mitral valve flaps is the main surgical treatment for mitral regurgitation.  The operation is carried out under general anaesthetic and your surgeon will usually gain access to your heart through an incision made along your chest. Some surgeons may also perform this type of operation using laparoscopic (\u2018keyhole\u2019) techniques, and the advantages of this approach are still being evaluated. The two flaps of the mitral valve are then partially clipped or sewn together to reduce the amount of blood leaking backwards by keeping the flaps close together during each heart contraction. This operation is generally successful, with only a small chance of major complications. Mitral valve replacement surgery Mitral valve replacement is usually only considered if you're unable to have the valve repaired. You will need it if your valve is furred up with calcium deposits or if the leaflets of your valve do not move. During surgery, your mitral valve is replaced with either a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve, which is made from animal tissue. This is major open heart surgery performed under general anaesthetic and usually involves making an incision along your chest. You'll be put on a heart-lung bypass machine during the operation, which takes over the function of your heart and lungs while the procedure is carried out. You will  usually need to take medication to prevent blood clots for a long period after this operation. This operation is generally successful, with a small chance of major complications, although the risk of serious and life-threatening problems is generally higher than with mitral valve repair surgery. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty Balloon valvuloplasty, also known as percutaneous mitral commissurotomy, is a non-surgical treatment option for mitral valve stenosis. It's usually performed by a cardiologist (heart specialist) using just a local anaesthetic (where you remain awake but your skin is numbed). A catheter is inserted through your skin via a large vein in your groin or neck and passed through to your heart. The tip of the catheter, which has a balloon attached, is positioned directly inside the narrowed valve. The balloon is inflated and deflated several times to widen the valve opening, before the balloon is deflated and removed. This procedure is most commonly used in young patients who do not have too much calcium deposited on their valve, pregnant women, and patients who are at an increased risk of developing complications from a mitral valve replacement (see above). Using this method is generally less predictable and less reliable than accessing the valve directly, although recovery is generally faster. Some mitral valve problems can be treated by replacing the faulty valve  Community content from HealthUnlocked Having an operation If your GP has suggested you may need surgery, this guide is for you Page last reviewed: 30\/09\/2014 Next review due: 30\/07\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The full course of MMR vaccination requires two doses. Measles, mumps and rubella are highly infectious conditions that can have serious, and potentially fatal, complications, including meningitis, swelling of the brain (encephalitis) and deafness. They can also lead to complications in pregnancy that affect the unborn baby, and can lead to miscarriage.  Since the MMR vaccine was introduced in 1988, it's rare for children in the UK to develop these serious conditions. However, outbreaks happen and there have been cases of measles in recent years, so it's important to ensure that you and your children are up-to-date with the MMR vaccination. This NHS leaflet tells you about MMR vaccination. MMR vaccine for babies and preschoolers The MMR vaccine is given on the NHS as a single injection to babies as part of their routine vaccination schedule, usually within a month of their first birthday. They will then have a second injection of the vaccine before starting school, usually at three years and four months. The MMR vaccine can sometimes be given to babies from six months of age if they may have been exposed to the measles virus, or during a measles outbreak.   Babies under six months old are not routinely given the MMR vaccine. This is because the antibodies to measles, mumps and rubella passed from mother to baby at the time of birth are retained and can work against the vaccine, meaning that the vaccine is not usually effective. These maternal antibodies decline with age and are almost all gone by the time MMR is normally given \u2013 around the age of one. MMR vaccination is recommended for six- to nine-month-old babies if they are at high risk of becoming infected in certain circumstances, such as during a measles outbreak. However, these children may not have enough protection from this early dose, so they will still need the standard MMR doses at 12-13 months and 40 months of age. The MMR vaccine is given as a single injection into the muscle of the thigh or upper arm. Find out which children and adults should have the MMR vaccine. Watch these healthtalk.org videos where parents weigh up the risks and benefits of MMR vaccination. MMR for older children Children up to the age of 18 who missed, or only partially completed, their earlier MMR vaccination can have a \"catch-up\" MMR vaccination on the NHS.   If you know or suspect your child hasn't been fully immunised, arrange with your GP for them to have a catch-up MMR vaccination. MMR for women planning pregnancy If you're thinking about getting pregnant, it's a good idea to check that you are fully protected against measles, mumps and rubella. Rubella infection in pregnancy can lead to serious birth defects and miscarriage. If you're not sure whether you've had two doses of the MMR vaccine, ask your GP practice to check.  If you haven't had both doses or there's no record available, you can have the vaccinations at your GP practice. You should avoid becoming pregnant for one month after having MMR vaccination. Be aware that the MMR vaccine is not suitable for women who are already pregnant. MMR for non-immune adults The MMR vaccine can also be given on the NHS to adults who may need it, including people born from 1970-79 who may have only been vaccinated against measles, as well as those born from 1980-90 who may not be protected against mumps. Check with your GP if you're not sure whether you've had the MMR vaccine. If in doubt, go ahead and have it. Even if you've had it before, it won't harm you to have a second, or even third, course of the vaccination. Read more about when the MMR vaccine is needed. Find out why some teenagers should have the MMR vaccination. Get advice on how to protect yourself and your family if there's a measles outbreak. Read the NHS leaflet: measles not just a kids' problem (PDF, 868kb) How the MMR vaccine works The MMR vaccine contains weakened versions of live measles, mumps and rubella viruses. The vaccine works by triggering the immune system to produce antibodies against measles, mumps and rubella. If you or your child then comes into contact with one of the diseases, the immune system will recognise it and immediately produce the antibodies needed to fight it. It's not possible for people who have recently had the MMR vaccine to infect other people. The MMR vaccine given in the UK is known under the brand names Priorix, or M-M-RVAXPRO. Read the patient information leaflet for Priorix (PDF, 124kb). Read the patient information leaflet for M-M-RVAXPRO (PDF, 104kb). Does the MMR vaccine cause autism? There has been some controversy about whether the MMR vaccine might cause autism, following a 1998 study by Dr Andrew Wakefield. In his paper, published in The Lancet, Dr Wakefield claimed there is a link between the MMR vaccine and autism or bowel disease. However, Andrew Wakefield's work has since been completely discredited and he has been struck off as a doctor in the UK. Subsequent studies in the last eight years have found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism or bowel disease. Watch healthtalk.org videos where parents discuss their worries about the MMR vaccine. Single measles, mumps and rubella vaccines Single vaccines are not available on the NHS in the UK because there is a risk that fewer children would receive all the necessary injections, increasing the levels of measles, mumps and rubella in the country. The delay in having six separate injections would also put more children at risk of developing the conditions, as well as increasing the amount of work and inconvenience for parents and those administering the vaccines.  Side effects of the MMR vaccine As there are three separate vaccines within a single injection, different side effects can occur at different times. The side effects of the MMR vaccine are usually mild. It's important to remember that they're milder than the potential complications of measles, mumps and rubella. Side effects include: developing a mild form of measles that lasts for two to three days \u2013 this is not infectious  developing a mild form of mumps that lasts for a day or two \u2013 this is not infectious In rare cases, a small rash of bruise-like spots may appear a few weeks after the injection. See your GP if you notice this kind of rash, or if you have any concerns about your child's symptoms after having the MMR jab. Find out how the MMR jab is given. This NHS leaflet tells you about the common vaccination reactions in babies and young children up to the age of five years. Read the answers to other common questions about the MMR vaccine.

There have been concerns that the radio waves they produce and receive might be unsafe. These radio waves are a type of low-energy, non-ionising electromagnetic radiation \u2013 a class of radiation that also includes visible light, ultraviolet (UV), and infrared radiation. Concerns have been expressed that prolonged or frequent exposure to radio waves might increase a person's risk of health problems such as cancer. However, most current research suggests it's unlikely that radio waves from mobile phones or base stations increase the risk of any health problems. The researchers acknowledge this evidence is based on use of mobile phones over the last 20 years, and there's still some uncertainty about possible health effects from using a phone for longer than this. Read more about the risks of mobile phone use. What research has been done into their safety? Since the 1990s, there's been a huge amount of scientific research into the potential health effects of mobile phone use. Large reviews of published research have concluded that overall the evidence doesn't suggest that radio waves from mobile phones cause health problems. This includes research by: the Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation (AGNIR) \u2013 part of Public Health England the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme (MTHR) the Million Women Study However, further research is still needed to check that there are no health impacts from long-term exposures (using a mobile phone for more than 20 years). Read more about this research in frequently asked questions about mobile phone safety. Mobile phones and driving Using a mobile phone while driving is considered the biggest health risk posed by mobile phones. It can increase your changes of having an accident, and it's illegal to use a handheld mobile phone while driving or riding a motorbike. The Department for Transport recommends the following guidelines for the safe use of mobile phones in cars: keep your mobile phone switched off when you're driving \u2013 you can use voicemail, a message service or call diversion to pick up your messages at the end of your journey if you need to use your mobile phone, stop in a safe place \u2013 don't stop on the hard shoulder of a motorway unless it's an emergency avoid using a hands-free device \u2013 these can be just as distracting as handheld phones Read more about using mobile phones when driving and the law on the GOV.UK website. Reducing exposure to mobile phones If you have concerns, there are various measures you can take to lower your exposure to radio waves produced by mobile phones. For example: Only make short calls on your mobile phone, and avoid using it more than necessary. Children should only use mobile phones for essential purposes and keep all calls short. Use a hands-free kit to keep your phone as far away from your head as possible, and keep your mobile phone away from your body when it's in standby mode. Only use your phone when the reception is strong \u2013 this is often indicated by bars of energy on your phone screen. Weak reception causes the phone to use more energy to communicate with the base station. Consider the specific absorption rate (SAR) of a mobile phone before you buy it \u2013 this is how much radio wave energy is absorbed into the body. Mobile phone retailers have a responsibility to make this information available to you before you buy.

What happens In a normal pregnancy, the placenta provides nourishment to the developing baby and removes waste products. The placenta is made up of millions of cells known as trophoblastic cells. In a molar pregnancy, these cells behave abnormally as soon as the egg has been fertilised by the sperm. This results in a mass of abnormal cells that can grow as fluid-filled sacs (cysts) with the appearance of white grapes. These cells grow rapidly within the womb, instead of developing into a baby. The abnormal cells are referred to as a \"mole\", which is from the Latin for mass or lump. Molar pregnancy is also called a hydatidiform mole and is a pre-cancerous form of gestational trophoblastic disease.  Molar pregnancies are caused by an imbalance in genetic material (chromosomes) in the pregnancy. This usually occurs when an egg that contains no genetic information is fertilised by a sperm (a complete molar pregnancy), or when a normal egg is fertilised by two sperm (a partial molar pregnancy). In complete molar pregnancy, the embryo does not develop at all. In a partial molar pregnancy, a foetus can develop but never results in a viable baby, due to the imbalance between the male and female chromosomes. A molar pregnancy is not caused by anything that you or your partner does or does not do. How common is molar pregnancy? Molar pregnancies are rare. About one to three in every 1,000 pregnancies turn out to be molar.  Increased risk Factors that increase the risk of molar pregnancies are thought to include: Age \u2013 complete molar pregnancies are more common in teenage women and women over 45 years old. Age has little or no effect on the risk of partial molar pregnancy.  Previous molar pregnancy \u2013 if you have had one molar pregnancy before, your chance of having another one is around one to two in 100, compared with one in 600 for women who haven't had a molar pregnancy. If you have had two or more molar pregnancies, your risk of having another is around 15-20 in 100.  Ethnicity \u2013 molar pregnancies are most common in Asian countries, such as Taiwan, the Philippines and Japan, and also among Native Americans. However, in recent years, the differences in the incidence of molar pregnancy between these communities and the general population have become less marked.  Types of molar pregnancy There are two main types of molar pregnancy, depending on the balance of chromosomes in the egg. These are: complete moles \u2013 when no normal placental tissue forms and no foetus develops; instead, a mass of abnormal cells grow partial moles \u2013 when some abnormal placental tissue forms along with some abnormal foetus; the foetus cannot develop into a baby In very rare cases, a twin pregnancy can include a normal foetus and a mole. Symptoms and diagnosis There are often no signs that a pregnancy is a molar pregnancy. In most cases, the problem is first spotted during an ultrasound scan, which may be the first pregnancy scan at 10-14 weeks. If there are symptoms, they usually appear between weeks 4 and 12 of pregnancy. The most common symptom is bleeding or losing brown-red fluid from the vagina. Sickness and vomiting may be more severe than in a normal pregnancy. Bleeding usually requires an ultrasound scan. If this scan is abnormal, an evacuation of the uterus is performed. This is when the molar pregnancy is removed, usually with a surgical procedure called suction evacuation. The surgery involves opening your cervix (neck of the womb) with a small tube known as a dilator, and removing any remaining tissue with a suction device. Tissue from the pregnancy is then sent to a laboratory to confirm whether it is a molar pregnancy. If a woman has a miscarriage or a termination for other reasons, tissue may be sent to a laboratory for analysis. This may confirm that the pregnancy was molar, even if a molar pregnancy wasn't suspected. Treatment A molar pregnancy usually needs to be removed surgically. This is done with a suction evacuation, under the care of a gynaecologist. In some cases, molar pregnancy can be treated with the removal of the womb (hysterectomy), but this is usually only if you no longer wish to have children. Almost all cases of molar pregnancy are successfully cured. For further information, go to the Charing Cross Hospital Trophoblast Disease Service or the The Sheffield Trophoblastic Disease Centre websites. After treatment Following the mole's removal, some cells will be left in the womb. These cells usually die off over time in around 90% of women. To check the cells have died, all women who have had a molar pregnancy in the UK undergo monitoring of the hormone hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) via the National Trophoblastic Screening Centre's surveillance programme. hCG is the pregnancy test hormone produced by a normal placenta, but also by the mole cells, and is the hormone detected in a pregnancy test. It can also be detected in blood and urine tests. Women on the surveillance programme send in blood or urine samples every two weeks. This is so they can be monitored for signs of persistent trophoblastic disease, which is a risk after all molar pregnancies (see below). Persistent trophoblastic disease needs further treatment with chemotherapy. For further information, go to the Charing Cross Hospital Trophoblast Disease Service or the Sheffield Trophoblastic Disease Centre websites. Hormone monitoring will identify the small number of women who develop a persistent or invasive mole (see below). In these cases, levels of hCG will stay steady or rise, rather than fall. Complications In some cases, the molar disease left after the evacuation of the uterus regrows rather than dies out, and is then known as a persistent disease. This is one of the malignant forms of gestational trophoblastic disease and includes invasive mole and choriocarcinoma. A further suction evacuation may help in a few patients, but chemotherapy is usually necessary to cure the problem. The risk of needing further treatment is: 1 in 10 after a complete molar pregnancy 1 in 100 after a partial molar pregnancy Invasive molar pregnancy is usually treated with chemotherapy in the form of methotrexate and folinic acid. Methotrexate is given as an intramuscular (into the muscle) injection, and folinic acid as a tablet. The injection and tablet are given on alternate days for eight days, followed by a six-day rest period. The eight-day cycle of injections and tablets then begins again. This continues until six weeks after the hCG levels return to normal.  Between one and three in every 100 women may see the condition flare up again, so all women are put into a follow-up programme to monitor their hCG after treatment. Persistent trophoblastic disease is different from normal types of cancer, and the cure rate for women developing it after a molar pregnancy is about 100%. This means that around 100 in 100 women who develop persistent trophoblastic disease after molar pregnancy are cured. There are two treatment centres on in Sheffield and one in London. For further information, go to the Charing Cross Hospital Trophoblast Disease Service or the Sheffield Trophoblastic Disease Centre website. Getting pregnant again It is recommended that you do not get pregnant again until you complete your hCG hormone monitoring, following a molar pregnancy. This normally happens within a few months, but in some cases can take up to a year. Your medical team will discuss this with you. Most women who have chemotherapy treatment for persistent trophoblastic disease will have started their periods again six months after treatment. The Charing Cross Hospital trophoblastic disease treatment team suggest that you do not try to get pregnant again for 12 months after finishing chemotherapy. You can use any method of contraception, including the pill. For an online patient support group with a chat room visit www.mymolarpregnancy.com. Grape-like cysts from a hydatidiform mole  Emotional effects While physical recovery is often relatively quick, it can take longer to recover emotionally from a molar pregnancy. Not only does molar pregnancy involve the loss of a foetus, it also carries the slight risk of a cancerous growth. This can create an enormous emotional strain. Communicating your feelings with your partner, a doctor, a counsellor, or someone else who has gone through a similar experience can be beneficial. There are support groups and forums that can help people handle the stress of a molar pregnancy, such as the Molar Pregnancy Support Group and the Hydatidiform Mole UK Information and Support Service.

The scientific name for moles is melanocytic naevi. Moles are often a brownish colour, although some may be darker or skin-coloured. They can be flat or raised, smooth or rough, and some have hair growing from them. Moles are usually circular or oval with a smooth edge. Moles can change in number and appearance. Some fade away over time, often without you realising. They also sometimes respond to hormonal changes, for example during: pregnancy \u2013 when they may get slightly darker teenage years \u2013 when they increase in number older age \u2013 when they may disappear from 40 to 50 years of age onwards Types of moles There are many different types of moles, the most common are: junctional melanocytic naevi \u2013 these are usually brown, round and flat dermal melanocytic naevi \u2013 these are usually raised, pale and sometimes hairy compound melanocytic naevi \u2013 these are usually raised above the skin, light brown and sometimes hairy Rarer types of moles include: halo naevi \u2013 moles surrounded by a white ring where the skin has lost its colour dysplastic or atypical naevi (also known as Clark naevi) \u2013 unusual looking and slightly larger moles that can be a range of colours and either flat or bumpy blue naevi \u2013 dark blue moles When and why do moles develop? Some moles are present at birth, although most develop during the first 30 years of life. People with fair skin often have more moles than people with darker skin. You are more likely to develop lots of moles, or a certain type of mole, if they are common in your family. Where you were brought up may also make a difference \u2013 for example, if you have spent a lot of time in the sun, you may have a lot of small moles. Harmless moles Most moles are completely harmless. However, they may be unsightly and affect your confidence. Moles can also be a nuisance, for example if they regularly catch on your clothing or you cut them while shaving. These moles can be surgically treated, although it can be expensive. You will usually have to pay for cosmetic mole treatment and it is often carried out at a private clinic. Ask your GP for advice about where to get treatment. If you are having a mole removed because it is a nuisance, your surgeon may just shave the mole off so that it is level with your skin. This is known as a shave excision. The wound may then be closed with heat during a process called cauterisation. Checking your skin You should check your skin every few months for any new moles that develop (particularly after your teenage years, when new moles become less common) or any changes to existing moles. A mole can change in weeks or months. Things to look for include: moles with uneven colouring \u2013 most moles only have one or two colours, but melanomas have lots of different shades moles with an uneven or ragged edge \u2013 moles are usually circular or oval with a smooth border bleeding, itching, red, inflamed (swollen) or crusty moles moles that get a lot bigger \u2013 most moles are no bigger than the width of a pencil A helpful way to remember what to look for is to use the ABCDE method. A \u2013 asymmetry B \u2013 border irregularity C \u2013 colour change D \u2013 diameter E \u2013 elevated (raised) or enlarged Moles like this can occur anywhere on your body, but most happen on the back, legs, arms and face. If you notice any changes to your moles or are worried about them, see your GP. Changes to a mole may be an early indication of a type of skin cancer called melanoma. Cancerous moles While most moles are benign (non-cancerous), in rare cases they can develop into melanoma. Melanoma is a serious and aggressive form of skin cancer. Melanomas usually appear as a dark, fast-growing spot where there was not one before, or a pre-existing mole that changes size, shape or colour and bleeds, itches or reddens. The main treatment for melanoma is surgery, although your treatment will depend on your circumstances. If melanoma is diagnosed and treated at an early stage then surgery is usually successful, although you may need follow-up care to prevent melanoma recurring. Read more about treating melanoma. Preventing cancerous moles If you have a lot of moles, it\u2019s important to take extra care in the sun. Although it\u2019s not always possible to prevent melanoma, avoiding overexposure to UV light can reduce your chances of developing it. You can help protect yourself from sun damage if you: stay in the shade when the sun is at its strongest (between 11am and 3pm) cover up with clothes, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses use a high-factor sunscreen (minimum SPF15) and reapply it regularly, particularly after swimming avoid using sunlamps or sunbeds because they give out UV rays Want to know more?

They most often develop on the chest and tummy and are common in older people. Freckles are small, flat brown marks that often appear on the face or areas exposed to the sun. They are caused by an increased amount of melanin, the pigment that gives your skin colour. Sun spots (solar lentigines) are brown marks on the skin, especially the face and arms, which can develop on people who spend a considerable amount of time in the sun. These tend to appear later in life.

The most common sign of melanoma is the appearance of a new mole or a change in an existing mole. This can happen anywhere on the body, but the back, legs, arms and face are most commonly affected. In most cases, melanomas have an irregular shape and more than one colour. They may also be larger than normal moles and can sometimes be itchy or bleed. An \"ABCDE checklist\" has been developed for people to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma. Watch a visual guide to moles. Read more about the symptoms of melanoma. These pages mainly cover a type of melanoma known as superficial spreading melanoma, which accounts for around 70% of all melanomas in the UK. Other types of melanoma are summarised below. Nodular melanoma Nodular melanoma is a fast-developing type of melanoma, most common in middle-aged people. It may not develop from an existing mole and can appear in areas of skin that aren't regularly exposed to the sun. Lentigo maligna melanoma Lentigo maligna melanoma is most common in elderly people and those who have spent a lot of time outdoors. It is common on the face and tends to grow slowly over a number of years. Acral lentiginous melanoma  Acral lentiginous melanoma is a rare type of melanoma that usually appears on the palms of the hands and the soles or big toenails of the feet. This is the most common type of melanoma in people with dark skin. Cancer Research UK has more information about the different types of melanoma. Why does melanoma happen? Melanoma happens when some cells in the skin begin to develop abnormally. It is thought that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from natural or artificial sources may be partly responsible. Certain things can increase your chances of developing melanoma, such as having: lots of moles or freckles pale skin that burns easily red or blonde hair a family member who has had melanoma Read more about the causes of melanoma. Diagnosing melanoma See your GP if you notice any change to your moles. Your GP will refer you to a specialist clinic or hospital if they think you have melanoma. In most cases, a suspicious mole will be surgically removed and studied to see if it is cancerous. This is known as a biopsy. You may also have a test to check if melanoma has spread elsewhere in your body. This is known as a sentinel node biopsy. Read more about diagnosing melanoma. How is melanoma treated? The main treatment for melanoma is surgery, although your treatment will depend on your circumstances. If melanoma is diagnosed and treated at an early stage, surgery is usually successful. If melanoma isn't diagnosed until an advanced stage, treatment is mainly used to slow the spread of the cancer and reduce symptoms. This usually involves medicines, such as chemotherapy. Read more about treating melanoma. Once you have had melanoma, there is a chance it may return. This risk is increased if your cancer was widespread and severe. If your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your melanoma returning, you will probably need regular check-ups to monitor your health. You will also be taught how to examine your skin and lymph nodes to help detect melanoma if it returns. Who is affected Melanoma is the 5th most common cancer in the UK with around 13,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed each year. More than a quarter of cases are diagnosed in people under 50, which is unusual compared to most other types of cancer. It's also becoming more common in the UK over time, thought to be caused by increased exposure to UV light from the sun and sunbeds. More than 2,000 people die every year in the UK from melanoma. Can melanoma be prevented? Melanoma is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing it by limiting your exposure to UV light. You can help protect yourself from sun damage by using sunscreen and dressing sensibly in the sun. Sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided. Regularly checking your moles and freckles can help lead to an early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment. Read more about sunscreen and sun safety.

It most commonly affects children, although it can occur at any age. Usually, the only symptom of MC is a number of small, firm, raised papules (spots) that develop on the skin. They are not painful, but can be itchy. Although the spots can look unpleasant, MC is generally a harmless condition that will normally resolve in a few months without any specific treatment. Read more about the symptoms of MC. When to seek medical advice Visit your GP if you think you or your child may have MC. Your GP will examine your skin (or your child's) and ask about any other symptoms. The spots of MC are usually easy to recognise, so your GP should be able to diagnose the condition without the need for further tests. Read more about diagnosing MC. What causes MC? MC is caused by a virus known as the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). This virus can be spread through: close direct contact \u2013 such as touching the skin of an infected person touching contaminated objects \u2013 such as towels, flannels, toys and clothes sexual contact \u2013 this includes intimate physical contact as well as sexual intercourse If you become infected by the virus and spots appear on your skin, the virus can also spread to other areas. It is not known exactly how long someone with MC is contagious for, but it is thought the contagious period may last up until the last spot has completely healed. Who is affected MC can affect anyone at any age, but the condition is most common in young children \u2013 particularly those aged between one and five. It is also more common in people with a weakened immune system \u2013 either due to a condition such as HIV or a treatment such as chemotherapy. MC can affect a person on more than one occasion, but this is uncommon. How MC is treated In people who are otherwise healthy, individual spots usually clear up within two months. However, it is common for the condition to spread around the body, so it can take up to 18 months or more for the condition to resolve completely. Routine treatment for MC, particularly in children, is generally not recommended because: the infection usually clears up on its own the infection does not normally cause any symptoms other than the spots the infection does not usually interfere with everyday activities, such as going to work, swimming or playing sports  treatments can be painful and may cause scarring or damage to the surrounding skin Treatment is usually only recommended for older children and adults when the spots are particularly unsightly and affect quality of life, or for people with weakened immune systems. In such cases, treatments that may be offered include liquids, gels or creams that are applied directly to the skin, or minor procedures such as cryotherapy (where the spots are removed by freezing them). In rare cases, the spots can become infected with bacteria, and occasionally the condition can lead to an eye infection, such as conjunctivitis. These complications may need additional treatment with antibiotics to clear the infection. Read more about treating MC and the complications of MC. Preventing MC Although MC is infectious, the chance of passing it on to others during normal activities is small. It is therefore not necessary to stay away from work, school or nursery, or to stop doing activities such as swimming if you have MC. However, you should take some steps to avoid spreading the virus to other people. You should: avoid squeezing or scratching the spots \u2013 as well as increasing the risk of the infection spreading, this can cause pain, bleeding and can lead to scarring keep affected areas of skin covered with clothing whenever possible \u2013 a waterproof bandage can be put over the area if you go swimming avoid sharing towels, flannels and clothing avoid sharing baths  Using a condom while having sex can reduce the risk of passing on MC during sexual contact, although this cannot prevent the spread of the virus completely, because it can be passed to nearby areas of skin that are not covered by a condom.

They're often present at birth or develop soon afterwards. There are several different types of birthmark and some of them are very common. The two main types of birthmark are: vascular birthmarks (often red, purple or pink) caused by abnormal blood vessels in or under the skin pigmented birthmarks (usually brown) caused by clusters of pigment cells Vascular birthmarks often occur in the head and neck area, mainly on the face. But both types of birthmark can appear anywhere, including inside the body. If surface blood vessels are affected, a vascular birthmark will appear red, purple or pink. If the affected vessels are deep, the birthmark will appear blue. Pigmented birthmarks are tan or brown-coloured skin marks. Vascular birthmarks Some of the most common types of vascular birthmarks are described below. Salmon patch (stork mark) Salmon patches are flat red or pink patches that can appear on a baby's eyelids, neck or forehead at birth. They're the most common type of vascular birthmark and occur in around half of all babies. Most salmon patches will fade completely within a few months, but if they occur on the forehead they may take up to four years to disappear. Patches on the back of the neck can last longer. Salmon patches are often more noticeable when a baby cries because they fill with blood and become darker. Infantile haemangioma Infantile haemangiomas, also known as strawberry marks, are raised marks on the skin that are usually red. They can appear anywhere on the body. Sometimes infantile haemangiomas occur deeper in the skin, in which case the skin can look blue or purple. Haemangiomas are common, particularly in girls, and affect around 5% of babies soon after birth. They rapidly increase in size for the first six months before eventually shrinking and disappearing by around seven years of age. Haemangiomas that get bigger rapidly, or those that interfere with vision or feeding, may need to be treated. Capillary malformation (port wine stain) Capillary malformation, also known as port wine stains, are flat red or purple marks that affect a very small number of newborn babies. They can vary in size, from a few millimetres to several centimetres in diameter. Port wine stains often affect one side of the body and usually occur on the face, chest and back (although they can occur anywhere). They tend to be sensitive to hormones and may become more noticeable around puberty, pregnancy and the menopause. Most are permanent and may deepen in colour over time. Pigmented birthmarks Some of the most common types of pigmented birthmarks are described below. Café-au-lait spots Café-au-lait spots are coffee-coloured skin patches. Many children have one or two, but if more than six have developed by the time the child is five, you should see your GP. It could be a sign of neurofibromatosis (a number of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along the nerves). Mongolian spots Mongolian spots are blue-grey or bruised-looking birthmarks that are present from birth. They're more commonly seen in darker-skinned people and usually occur over the lower back or buttocks. However, they can also appear elsewhere on the body or limbs. Mongolian spots may last for months or years, but they usually disappear by the time a child reaches four years of age. They're completely harmless and don't need treatment. They may sometimes be mistaken for a bruise. Congenital melanocytic naevi Congenital melanocytic naevi are also known as congenital moles. They're relatively large brown or black moles that are present from birth. They're fairly common and are caused by an overgrowth of pigment cells in the skin. Most congenital melanocytic naevi become proportionally smaller and less obvious with time, although they may darken during puberty or become bumpy or hairy. They can range in size from less than 1.5cm (about 0.6 inches) to more than 20cm (about 7.9 inches) in diameter. The risk of a naevi developing into skin cancer is low, but the risk increases the larger it is. What causes birthmarks? It's not fully understood why birthmarks occur, but they're not usually inherited. Vascular birthmarks are caused by abnormal blood vessels in or under the skin, and pigmented birthmarks are caused by clusters of pigment cells. Port wine stains are thought to occur because the nerves that control the widening or narrowing of the capillaries (tiny blood vessels) don't function properly, or there aren't enough of them. This means that blood is constantly supplied to the skin in that area, which makes it permanently red or purple in colour. Port wine stains are sometimes related to other conditions, such as Sturge-Weber syndrome and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. Read more about the complications associated with birthmarks. Treating birthmarks Most birthmarks are harmless and don't need to be treated. Some types of birthmarks will fade over time, whereas other types such as port wine stains will be permanent if they're not treated. In some cases, a birthmark will need to be treated for medical reasons \u2013 for example, if a haemangioma blocks the airways, affects vision or becomes ulcerated. Some people may also decide to seek treatment for cosmetic reasons.

It is also known as infectious mononucleosis, or \"mono\". Common symptoms include: a high temperature (fever) a severely sore throat swollen glands in the neck fatigue (extreme tiredness) While the symptoms of glandular fever can be very unpleasant, most of them should pass within two to three weeks. Fatigue, however, can occasionally last several months. Read more about the symptoms of glandular fever. When to seek medical advice You should contact your GP if you suspect that you or your child has glandular fever. While there is little your GP can do in terms of treatment, they can provide advice and support to help you control your symptoms and reduce the risk of passing the infection on to others. You should go to your local accident and emergency (A&E) department or dial 999 for an ambulance if you have glandular fever and you: develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties find swallowing fluids difficult develop intense abdominal pain These symptoms can be a sign of a complication of glandular fever that may need to be treated in hospital. What causes glandular fever? Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is found in the saliva of infected people and can be spread through: kissing \u2013 glandular fever is often referred to as the \"kissing disease\" exposure to coughs and sneezes sharing eating and drinking utensils, such as cups, glasses and unwashed cutlery EBV may be found in the saliva of someone who has had glandular fever for several months after their symptoms pass, and some people may continue to have the virus in their saliva on and off for years. If you have EBV, it's a good idea to take steps to avoid infecting others while you are ill, such as not kissing other people, but there's no need no need to avoid all contact with others as the chances of passing on the infection are generally low. Read more about the causes of glandular fever. Who is affected? Glandular fever can affect people of all ages, but most cases affect teenagers and young adults. Most EBV infections are thought to occur during childhood and cause only mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all. However, if a person develops an EBV infection during early adulthood, they can develop glandular fever. Once you have had glandular fever, it is unlikely you will develop it again. This is because people develop lifelong immunity after the initial infection. How glandular fever is diagnosed To diagnose glandular fever, your GP will first ask about your symptoms before carrying out a physical examination. They will look for characteristic signs of glandular fever, such as swollen glands, tonsils, liver and spleen. Your GP may also recommend a blood test to help confirm the diagnosis and rule out infections that can cause similar symptoms, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella, mumps and toxoplasmosis. How glandular fever is treated There is no cure for glandular fever, but there are a number of simple treatments and measures that can help reduce the symptoms while you wait for your body to control the infection. These include: drinking plenty of fluids taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen getting plenty of rest and gradually increasing your activity as your energy levels improve Occasionally, antibiotics or corticosteroids may be used if you develop complications of glandular fever. Some people with particularly severe symptoms may need to be looked after in hospital for a few days. Read more about treating glandular fever. Possible complications Complications associated with glandular fever are uncommon, but when they do occur they can be serious. They can include: further infections of other areas of the body, including the brain, liver and lungs severe anaemia (a lack of oxygen-carrying red blood cells) breathing difficulties as a result of the tonsils becoming significantly swollen a ruptured (burst) spleen, which may need to be treated with surgery Read more about the complications of glandular fever.

How can I cope with morning sickness? Media last reviewed: 20\/03\/2014 Next review due: 20\/03\/2017 Vomiting and sickness in pregnancy Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, also known as morning sickness, is very common in early pregnancy. It's unpleasant, but it doesn't put your baby at any increased risk and usually clears up by weeks 16 to 20 of pregnancy. Some women get a very severe form of nausea and vomiting called hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), which can be very serious. It needs specialist treatment, sometimes in hospital. Find out more about hyperemesis gravidarum. With morning sickness, some women are sick (vomit) and some have a feeling of sickness (nausea) without being sick. The term \"morning sickness\" is misleading. It can affect you at any time of the day or night, and some women feel sick all day long. It's thought hormonal changes in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy are probably one of the causes of morning sickness. Symptoms should ease as your pregnancy progresses. In some women, symptoms disappear by the third month of pregnancy. However, some women experience nausea and vomiting for longer than this, and about 1 woman in 10 continues to feel sick after week 20. How common is morning sickness? During early pregnancy, nausea, vomiting and tiredness are common symptoms. Around half of all pregnant women experience vomiting, and more than 80% of women (80 out of 100) experience nausea in the first 12 weeks.  People sometimes consider morning sickness a minor inconvenience of pregnancy, but for some women it can have a significant adverse effect on their day-to-day activities and quality of life. Treatments for morning sickness If you have morning sickness, your GP or midwife will initially recommend that you try a number of changes to your diet and daily life to help reduce your symptoms. These include: getting plenty of rest \u2013 tiredness can make nausea worse if you feel sick first thing in the morning, give yourself time to get up slowly \u2013 if possible, eat something like dry toast or a plain biscuit before you get up drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, and sipping them little and often rather than in large amounts, as this may help prevent vomiting eating small, frequent meals that are high in carbohydrate (such as bread, rice and pasta) and low in fat \u2013 most women can manage savoury foods, such as toast, crackers and crispbread, better than sweet or spicy foods eating small amounts of food often rather than several large meals \u2013 but don't stop eating eating cold meals rather than hot ones as they don't give off the smell that hot meals often do, which may make you feel sick avoiding foods or smells that make you feel sick avoiding drinks that are cold, tart (sharp) or sweet asking the people close to you for extra support and help \u2013 it helps if someone else can cook, but if this isn't possible, go for bland, non-greasy foods, such as baked potatoes or pasta, which are simple to prepare distracting yourself as much as you can \u2013 the nausea can get worse the more you think about it wearing comfortable clothes without tight waistbands If you have severe morning sickness, your doctor or midwife might recommend medication. Anti-sickness remedies If your nausea and vomiting is severe and doesn't improve after you make changes to your diet and lifestyle, your GP may recommend a short-term course of an anti-sickness medicine that is safe to use in pregnancy. This type of medicine is called an antiemetic. The commonly prescribed antiemetics can have side effects. These are rare, but can include muscle twitching. Some antihistamines (medicines often used to treat allergies such as hay fever) also work as antiemetics. Your doctor might prescribe an antihistamine that is safe to take in pregnancy. See your GP if you would like to consider this form of treatment. Ginger eases morning sickness There is some evidence that ginger supplements may help reduce nausea and vomiting. To date, there have not been any reports of adverse effects being caused by taking ginger during pregnancy. However, ginger products are unlicensed in the UK, so buy them from a reputable source, such as a pharmacy or supermarket. Check with your pharmacist before you use ginger supplements. Some women find that ginger biscuits or ginger ale can help reduce nausea. You can try different things to see what works for you. Find out more about vitamins and supplements in pregnancy.  Acupressure might help morning sickness Acupressure on the wrist may also be effective in reducing symptoms of nausea in pregnancy. Acupressure involves wearing a special band or bracelet on your forearm. Some researchers have suggested that putting pressure on certain parts of the body may cause the brain to release certain chemicals that help reduce nausea and vomiting. There have been no reports of any serious adverse effects caused by using acupressure during pregnancy, although some women have experienced numbness, pain and swelling in their hands. When to see a doctor for morning sickness If you are vomiting and can't keep any food or drink down, there is a chance that you could become dehydrated or malnourished. Contact your GP or midwife immediately if you: have very dark-coloured urine or do not pass urine for more than eight hours are unable to keep food or fluids down for 24 hours feel severely weak, dizzy or faint when standing up have abdominal (tummy) pain have a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above vomit blood Urinary tract infections (UTIs) can also cause nausea and vomiting. A UTI is an infection that usually affects the bladder but can spread to the kidneys. If you have any pain when passing urine or you pass any blood, you may have a urine infection and this will need treatment. Drink plenty of water to dilute your urine and reduce pain. You should contact your GP within 24 hours. Risk factors for morning sickness A number of different factors may mean you are more likely to have nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. These include: nausea and vomiting in a previous pregnancy a family history of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, or morning sickness a history of motion sickness \u2013 for example, in a car a history of nausea while using contraceptives that contain oestrogen obesity \u2013 where you have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more stress multiple pregnancies, such as twins or triplets first pregnancy Page last reviewed: 12\/02\/2015 Next review due: 12\/02\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Around 7 out of every 10 pregnant women experience nausea and\/or vomiting, and this doesn't just occur in the morning. For most women, this improves or disappears completely by around week 14, although for some women it can last longer. Some pregnant women experience excessive nausea and vomiting. They might be sick many times a day and be unable to keep food or drink down, which can have a negative effect on their daily life. This excessive nausea and vomiting is known as hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), and often needs hospital treatment. Exactly how many pregnant women get HG is not known, as some cases may go unreported, but it's thought to be around 1 in every 100. If you are being sick frequently and can't keep food down, tell your midwife or doctor, or contact the hospital as soon as possible. There is a risk you may become dehydrated, and your midwife or doctor can make sure you get the right treatment. Symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum HG is much worse than the normal nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (\"morning sickness\"). Signs and symptoms of HG include: prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting \u2013 some women report being sick up to 50 times a day dehydration \u2013 not having enough fluids in your body because you can't keep drinks down; if you're drinking less than 500ml a day, you need to seek help ketosis \u2013 a serious condition that results in the build-up of acidic chemicals in the blood and urine; ketones are produced when your body breaks down fat, rather than glucose, for energy weight loss low blood pressure (hypotension) when standing Unlike regular pregnancy sickness, HG may not get better by 14 weeks. It may not clear up completely until the baby is born, although some symptoms may improve at around 20 weeks. See your GP or midwife if you have severe nausea and vomiting, ideally before you start suffering from dehydration and weight loss. There are other conditions that can cause nausea and vomiting, such as appendicitis, and your doctor will need to rule these out first. healthtalk.org has videos and written interviews of women talking about their experiences of hyperemesis gravidarum, and how they coped. What causes hyperemesis gravidarum? It's not known what causes HG, or why some women get it and others don't. Some experts believe that it is linked to the changing hormones in your body that occur during pregnancy. There is some evidence that it runs in families, so if you have a mother or sister who has had HG in a pregnancy, you may be more likely to get it yourself. If you have had HG in a previous pregnancy, you are more likely to get it in your next pregnancy than women who have never had it before, so it's worth planning in advance. Treating hyperemesis gravidarum There are medications that can be used in pregnancy, including the first 12 weeks, to help improve the symptoms of HG. These include anti-sickness (anti-emetic) drugs, vitamins (B6 and B12) and steroids, or combinations of these. Evidence suggests that the earlier you start treatment, the more effective it will be. You may need to try different types of medication until you find what works best for you. If your nausea and vomiting cannot be controlled, you may need to be admitted to hospital. This is so that doctors can assess your condition and give you the right treatment, to protect the health of you and your baby. Treatment can include intravenous fluids, which are given directly into a vein through a drip. If you have severe vomiting, the anti-sickness drugs may also need to be given via a vein or a muscle. The charity Pregnancy Sickness Support has information and tips on coping with nausea and vomiting, including HG. Will hyperemesis gravidarum harm my baby? HG is unpleasant with dramatic symptoms, but the good news is that it's unlikely to harm your baby, if treated effectively. However, if it causes you to lose weight during pregnancy, there is an increased risk that your baby may be born smaller than expected (have a low birthweight). This is why it's important to be monitored for dehydration. Other symptoms you may experience Pregnancy Sickness Support is in touch with many women who have had HG, and who report having some or all of the following symptoms in addition to the main symptoms listed above:  extremely heightened sense of smell excessive saliva production, known as ptyalism headaches and constipation from dehydration pressure sores from long periods of time in bed episodes of urinary incontinence, due to vomiting combined with pregnancy hormone relaxin If you experience these symptoms, you are not alone. Many women have them and, although they can be distressing, they will go away when the HG stops or the baby is born. How you might feel The nausea and vomiting of HG can have a huge impact on your life, at a time when you were expecting to be enjoying pregnancy and looking forward to the birth of your baby. It can affect you both emotionally and physically. The symptoms not only make your life a misery, but may lead to further health complications, such as depression or tears in your oesophagus. Severe sickness can be exhausting and stop you from doing everyday tasks, such as going to work or even getting out of bed. In addition to feeling very unwell and tired, you might also feel: anxious about going out or being too far from home, in case you need to vomit isolated, because you don't know anyone who understands what it's like to have HG confused as to why this is happening to you unsure whether you can cope with the rest of the pregnancy if you continue to feel very ill If you feel any of these, don't keep it to yourself. Talk to your midwife or doctor, and explain the impact HG is having on your life and how it is making you feel. You could also talk to your partner, family and friends, if you want to. If you want to talk to someone who has been through HG, you can contact Pregnancy Sickness Support. They have a support network across the UK, and can put you in touch with someone who has had HG. Bear in mind that HG is much worse than regular pregnancy sickness \u2013 it is not the result of anything you have or haven't done, and you do need treatment and support. Another pregnancy If you have had HG before, it's likely that you will get it again in another pregnancy. If you decide on another pregnancy, it can help to plan ahead, such as arranging child care so that you can get plenty of rest. Think back to what helped you last time \u2013 for example, specific drinks \u2013 and make sure you implement these measures this time around. Talk to your doctor about starting medication early.   Blood clots and hyperemesis gravidarum Because HG can cause dehydration, there's also an increased risk of having deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot), although this is rare.  If you are dehydrated and immobile, there is treatment that you can be given to prevent blood clots.

Where to get contraception Where you can go for contraception, information and advice You are here: Health A-Z Contraception guide Share: Save: Print: Emergency contraception (morning after pill, IUD) Emergency contraception can prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or if your contraceptive method has failed \u2013 for example, a condom has split or you've missed a pill. There are two types:  the emergency contraceptive pill (sometimes called the morning after pill) the IUD (intrauterine device, or coil) At a glance: emergency contraception   The emergency pill    The IUD as emergency contraception   Where to get emergency contraception   Contraception for the future There are two kinds of emergency contraceptive pill. Levonelle has to be taken within 72 hours (three days) of sex, and ellaOne has to be taken within 120 hours (five days) of sex. Both pills work by preventing or delaying ovulation (release of an egg). The IUD can be inserted into your uterus up to five days after unprotected sex, or up to five days after the earliest time you could have ovulated. It may stop an egg from being fertilised or implanting in your womb. Emergency contraception does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). At a glance: facts about emergency contraception Both types of emergency contraception are effective at preventing pregnancy if they are used soon after unprotected sex. Less than 1% of women who use the IUD get pregnant, whereas pregnancies after the emergency contraceptive pill are not as rare. It\u2019s thought that ellaOne is more effective than Levonelle. The sooner you take Levonelle or ellaOne, the more effective it will be. Levonelle or ellaOne can make you feel sick, dizzy or tired, or give you a headache, tender breasts or abdominal pain. Levonelle or ellaOne can make your period earlier or later than usual. If you\u2019re sick (vomit) within two hours of taking Levonelle, or three hours of taking ellaOne, seek medical advice as you will need to take another dose or have an IUD fitted. If you use the IUD as emergency contraception, it can be left in as your regular contraceptive method. If you use the IUD as a regular method of contraception, it can make your periods longer, heavier or more painful. You may feel some discomfort when the IUD is put in \u2013 painkillers can help to relieve this. There are no serious side effects of using emergency contraception. Emergency contraception does not cause an abortion. The emergency pill How the emergency pill works How effective the emergency pill is at preventing pregnancy How it affects your period  Who can use the emergency pill  During breastfeeding If you're already using the pill, patch, vaginal ring or injection Side effects of the emergency pill The emergency pill and other medicines Can I get the emergency pill in advance? How the emergency pill works Levonelle Levonelle contains levonorgestrel, a synthetic version of the natural hormone progesterone. In a woman\u2019s body, progesterone plays a role in ovulation and preparing the uterus for accepting a fertilised egg. It\u2019s not known exactly how Levonelle works, but it\u2019s thought to work primarily by preventing or delaying ovulation. It does not interfere with your regular method of contraception. ellaOne ellaOne contains ulipristal acetate, which stops progesterone working normally. It prevents pregnancy mainly by preventing or delaying ovulation.` Levonelle and ellaOne do not continue to protect you against pregnancy. This means that if you have unprotected sex at any time after taking the emergency pill you can become pregnant. Even if you are starting or continuing another method of hormonal contraception, it may not be effective immediately. You will need to use condoms or avoid sex until the contraception is working effectively. The time it takes for contraception to become effective depends on the emergency contraceptive pill and the method of hormonal contraception being started. Your doctor or nurse will tell you when you can start hormonal contraception and how long you will need to take additional precautions to prevent an unintended pregnancy. Levonelle and ellaOne are not intended to be used as a regular form of contraception. However, you can use emergency contraception more than once in a menstrual cycle if necessary. How effective is the emergency pill at preventing pregnancy? You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services some pharmacies  Find a clinic near you It can be difficult to know how many pregnancies the emergency pill prevents, because there is no way to know for sure how many women would have got pregnant if they did not take it. A study published in 2010 showed that of 1,696 women who received the emergency pill within 72 hours of sex, 37 became pregnant (1,659 did not). Of 203 women who took the emergency pill between 72 and 120 hours after unprotected sex, there were three pregnancies. Find out more about the research on the effectiveness of both emergency contraception pills. However, it's important to remember that the sooner you take emergency contraception after sex, the more effective it will be. How it affects your period After taking the emergency contraceptive pill, most women will have a normal period at the expected time. However, you may have your period later or earlier than normal. If your period is more than seven days late, or is unusually light or short, contact your GP as soon as possible to check for pregnancy. Who can use the emergency pill? Most women can use the emergency contraceptive pill. This includes women who cannot usually use hormonal contraception, such as the combined pill and contraceptive patch. Girls aged under 16 years old can also use the emergency contraceptive pill. Levonelle The WHO does not identify any medical condition that would mean a woman shouldn\u2019t use Levonelle. ellaOne The manufacturer of ellaOne advises that it should not be used by women who:  are allergic to any of the components of the drug have severe asthma that is treated with glucocorticoids (steroid) tablets have certain rare hereditary problems with lactose metabolism ellaOne may not be effective in women who are taking liver enzyme-inducing medication. For more information, read The emergency pill and other medicines. Breastfeeding Levonelle Levonelle can be taken while breastfeeding. Although small amounts of the hormones contained in the pill may pass into your breast milk, it is not thought to be harmful to your baby. ellaOne The safety of ellaOne during breastfeeding is not yet known. The manufacturer recommends that you do not breastfeed for one week after taking this pill. If you are already using the pill, patch, vaginal ring or contraceptive injection You may need to take the emergency pill if you: forgot to take some of your regular contraceptive pills, or did not use your contraceptive patch or vaginal ring correctly, or were late having your contraceptive implant or contraceptive injection If you have taken Levonelle, then you should:  take your next contraceptive pill, apply a new patch or insert a new ring within 12 hours of taking the emergency pill You should then continue taking your regular contraceptive pill as normal. You will need to use additional contraception, such as condoms, for: the next seven days if you use the patch, ring, combined pill (except Qlaira), implant or injection nine days for the combined pill Qlaira  the next two days if you use the progestogen-only pill If you have taken ellaOne, you will need to wait at least five days before taking your next contraceptive pill, applying a new patch or inserting a new ring. You should then use additional contraception, such as condoms, while waiting to restart your contraceptive method and then for: the next seven days if you use the patch, ring, combined pill (except Qlaira), implant or injection nine days for the combined pill Qlaira  the next two days if you use the progestogen-only pill What are the side effects of using the emergency pill? Taking the emergency contraceptive pill has not been shown to cause any serious or long-term health problems. However, it can sometimes have side effects. Common side effects include:  abdominal (tummy) pain headache irregular menstrual bleeding (spotting or heavy bleeding) before your next period is due feeling sick tiredness Less common side effects include: breast tenderness dizziness headache vomiting (seek medical advice if you vomit within two hours of taking Levonelle, or three hours of taking ellaOne, as you will need to take another dose or have an IUD fitted) If you are concerned about any symptoms after taking the emergency contraceptive pill, contact your GP or speak to a nurse at a sexual health clinic. You should talk to a doctor or nurse if:  you think you might be pregnant your next period is more than seven days late your period is shorter or lighter than usual you have any sudden or unusual pain in your lower abdomen (this could be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy, where a fertilised egg implants outside the womb \u2013 this is rare but serious, and needs immediate medical attention)  The emergency pill and other medicines The emergency contraceptive pill may interact with other medicines. These include:  the herbal medicine St John\u2019s Wort some medicines used to treat epilepsy some medicines used to treat HIV some medicines used to treat tuberculosis (TB) medication such as omeprazole (an antacid) to make your stomach less acidic ellaOne cannot be used if you are already taking one of these medicines, as it may not be effective. Levonelle may still be used, but the dose may need to be increased \u2013 your doctor or pharmacist can advise on this. There should be no interaction between the emergency pill and most antibiotics. Two enzyme-inducing antibiotics (called rifampicin and rifabutin), used to treat or prevent meningitis or TB, may affect ellaOne while they\u2019re being taken and for 28 days afterwards. If you want to check that your medicines are safe to take with the emergency contraceptive pill, ask your GP or a pharmacist. You should also read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicines.  Can I get the emergency contraceptive pill in advance? You may be able to get the emergency contraceptive pill in advance of having unprotected sex if: you are worried about your contraceptive method failing you are going on holiday you cannot get hold of emergency contraception easily Ask your GP or nurse for further information on getting advance emergency contraception. The IUD as emergency contraception An intrauterine device (IUD) How the IUD works How effective the IUD is at preventing pregnancy Who can use the IUD During pregnancy and breastfeeding Side effects of using the IUD  The IUD and other medicines How the IUD works The intrauterine device (IUD) is a small, T-shaped contraceptive device made from plastic and copper. It\u2019s inserted into the uterus by a trained health professional. It may prevent an egg from implanting in your womb or being fertilised. If you\u2019ve had unprotected sex, the IUD can be inserted up to five days afterwards, or up to five days after the earliest time you could have ovulated, to prevent pregnancy. It\u2019s more effective at preventing pregnancy than the emergency pill, and it does not interact with any other medication. You can also choose to have the IUD left in as an ongoing method of contraception. How effective is the IUD at preventing pregnancy? There are several types of IUD. Newer ones have more copper and are more than 99% effective. Fewer than two women in 100 who use a newer IUD over five years will get pregnant. IUDs with less copper in them are less effective than this, but are still effective. The IUD is more effective than the emergency pill at preventing pregnancy after unprotected sex. Who can use the IUD? Most women can use an IUD, including women who have never been pregnant and those who are HIV positive. Your GP or clinician will ask about your medical history to check if an IUD is suitable for you. You should not use an IUD if you have: an untreated STI or a pelvic infection certain abnormalities of the womb or cervix any unexplained bleeding from your vagina \u2013 for example, between periods or after sex Women who have a heart condition should consult their GP or cardiologist before having an IUD fitted. Pregnancy and breastfeeding The IUD should not be inserted if there is a risk that you may already be pregnant. The IUD can be used safely if you\u2019re breastfeeding, but the risk of complications during insertion is slightly higher. What are the side effects of the IUD Complications after having an IUD fitted are rare, but can include pain, infection, damage to the womb or expulsion (the IUD coming out of your womb). If you use the IUD as an ongoing method of regular contraception, it may make your periods longer, heavier or more painful. The IUD and other medicines The emergency IUD will not react with any other medication. Where can I get emergency contraception? You can get the emergency contraceptive pill and the IUD for free from: a GP surgery that provides contraception (some GP surgeries may not provide the IUD) a contraception clinic  a sexual health clinic (find sexual health services near you) some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics some young people's clinics (call 0300 123 7123) You can also get the emergency contraceptive pill free from: most pharmacies (find pharmacies near you)  some NHS walk-in centres and minor injuries units some Accident & Emergency departments The doctor or nurse you see may ask for the following information: when you have had unprotected sex in your current menstrual cycle the date of the first day of your last period and the usual length of your cycle details of any contraceptive failure (such as how many pills you may have missed, and when) if you've used any medications that may affect your contraception You can buy the emergency contraceptive pill from most pharmacies if you're aged 16 or over and from some organisations such as bpas or Marie Stopes. The cost varies, but it will be around £30 to £35. Contraception for the future If you're not using a regular method of contraception, you might consider doing so in order to lower the risk of unintended pregnancy. Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) offers the most reliable protection against pregnancy, and you don't have to think about it every day or each time you have sex. LARC methods are the: injection implant IUS IUD     Page last reviewed: 13\/01\/2015 Next review due: 13\/01\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's also known as Morton's metatarsalgia or interdigital neuroma. In Morton's neuroma, a nerve in the foot becomes irritated and thickened, which can cause severe pain. The condition can occur in one foot or both feet. It usually affects the nerve between the third and fourth toes, but sometimes the second and third toes are affected. Morton's neuroma can occur at any age, but most often affects middle-aged women. This may be because women tend to wear tight or high-heeled shoes that can put pressure on the feet. It's also increasingly seen in runners, possibly because of the increased pressure on the toes that occurs when running. Symptoms of Morton's neuroma You may initially experience a tingling sensation in the space between your toes, which gets worse over time. This eventually develops into a sharp shooting or burning pain in the ball of your foot or at the base of your toes. There may also be some numbness in your toes. The pain is often worse when walking or wearing shoes that squash the feet. Some people describe walking with Morton's neuroma as feeling like there's a small stone stuck under your foot. Removing your shoes and rubbing your foot may reduce the pain. When to seek medical advice It's a good idea to make an appointment to see a podiatrist (specialist in foot problems) if you have persistent symptoms of Morton's neuroma, as the condition is unlikely to improve on its own. You could also visit your GP, who may refer you to a podiatrist. Your GP or podiatrist may examine your foot and ask you some questions to find out: about the pain and what it feels like when your symptoms started what type of shoes you usually wear about your work, lifestyle and sporting activities They can also suggest simple measures you can try at home to reduce your symptoms, or recommend other treatments. Find a podiatrist near you. What causes Morton's neuroma? Morton's neuroma occurs when one of the nerves between the toe bones becomes irritated, which causes it to become thicker. The exact cause of the irritation is unknown, but it may be caused by the nerve being squashed (compressed), stretched or damaged. The condition has been linked to: wearing tight, pointy or high-heeled shoes being active and playing sport \u2013 particularly running or sports that involve running and placing pressure on the feet, such as racquet sports other foot problems, such as flat feet, high arches, bunions and hammer toes It's not clear if these directly cause the condition or just make the symptoms worse. Treating Morton's neuroma Treatment for Morton's neuroma will depend on how long you've had the condition and its severity. Simple non-surgical treatments are effective for some people. Others may need surgery.  Non-surgical treatments At first, your podiatrist or GP may recommend: changing your footwear \u2013 shoes with a wider toe area may help ease the pressure on the nerve in your foot orthotic devices \u2013 a soft pad for the ball of your foot may help relieve the pressure on the nerve painkillers \u2013 taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory painkillers, such as ibuprofen, may help ease the pain and inflammation losing weight \u2013 if you're overweight, losing weight may reduce the strain on your feet injections \u2013 injections of a steroid medication or alcohol solution alongside a local anaesthetic may offer some pain relief Resting your foot and massaging your toes may also help relieve the pain. Some people also find it useful to hold an ice pack against their foot. A relatively new procedure called cryosurgery (or cryotherapy), where a small probe is inserted into the foot and used to destroy the thickened nerve tissue by freezing it, is also sometimes used to treat Morton's neuroma. However, this is still fairly experimental and isn't widely available in the UK. You'll usually have to pay for it privately. Surgery Surgery for Morton's neuroma is usually only recommended if you have very severe pain or if the treatments above haven't worked. In this case, your GP can refer you to a podiatric or orthopaedic surgeon to discuss whether surgery is suitable for you. During the operation, a small incision is made on the top or bottom of your foot so the surgeon can access the affected nerve. They will then either: increase the space around the nerve by removing some of the surrounding tissue, or remove part of the nerve \u2013 if this is done, the area between your toes will be permanently numb The procedure is usually carried out using a general anaesthetic or local anaesthetic. You normally won't need to stay in hospital overnight. After the procedure, you'll need to wear a special protective shoe until the affected area has healed enough to wear normal footwear. You can usually walk soon after the operation, although it will take weeks or months to make a full recovery. Most people who have surgery to treat Morton's neuroma have positive results and their pain is relieved afterwards. As with all types of surgery, however, complications can occur, such as swelling, infection and pain. You should discuss the risks with your surgeon before having the procedure.

But occasionally they can become infected, cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or spread serious illnesses such as Lyme disease and malaria. Bugs that bite or sting include wasps, hornets, bees, horseflies, ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, spiders and midges. This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you've been bitten or stung When to get medical advice When to get emergency medical help Prevention Symptoms of insect bites and stings Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Some people have a mild allergic reaction and a larger area of skin around the bite or sting becomes swollen, red and painful. This should pass within a week. Occasionally, a severe allergic reaction can occur, causing symptoms such as breathing difficulties, dizziness and a swollen face or mouth. This requires immediate medical treatment (see below). Read more about the symptoms of common insect bites and stings. What to do if you've been bitten or stung To treat an insect bite or sting: Remove the sting or tick if it's still in the skin (see treating insect bites and stings for advice about how to do this safely). Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they're unlikely to help. The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. Ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments that can help, such as painkillers, creams for itching and antihistamines. Read more about treatments for insect bites and stings. When to get medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if: you're worried about a bite or sting your symptoms don't start to improve within a few days or are getting worse you've been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes a large area (around 10cm or more) around the bite becomes red and swollen you have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness you have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a fever, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms When to get emergency medical help Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe reaction, such as: wheezing or difficulty breathing a swollen face, mouth or throat nausea or vomiting a fast heart rate dizziness or feeling faint difficulty swallowing loss of consciousness Emergency treatment in hospital is needed in these cases. Prevent insect bites and stings There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin \u2013 repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants \u2013 these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. You may need to take extra precautions if you're travelling to part of the world where there's a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about how to prevent insect bites and stings.

It\u2019s also sometimes known as travel sickness, seasickness, car sickness or air sickness. Initial symptoms of motion sickness may include: pale skin cold sweat dizziness an increase in saliva vomiting Some people also experience additional symptoms, such as: rapid, shallow breathing headaches drowsiness extreme tiredness In most cases, the symptoms of motion sickness will start to improve as your body adapts to the conditions causing the problem. For example, if you have motion sickness on a cruise ship, your symptoms may get better after a couple of days. However, some people don't adapt and have symptoms until they leave the environment that's causing them. Anyone can get motion sickness, but some are more vulnerable than others. Women often experience motion sickness, particularly during periods or pregnancy. People who often get migraines may also be more likely to experience motion sickness and to have a migraine at the same time. Motion sickness is also more common in children aged 3 to 12. After this age, most teenagers grow out of the condition. When to seek medical advice It's only necessary to seek medical advice about motion sickness if your symptoms continue after you stop travelling. Your GP will be able to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as a viral infection of your inner ear (labyrinthitis). What causes motion sickness? Motion sickness is usually associated with travelling in a car, ship, plane or train. However, you can also get it on fairground rides and while watching or playing fast-paced films or computer games. Motion sickness is thought to occur when there's a conflict between what your eyes see and what your inner ears, which help with balance, sense. Your brain holds details about where you are and how you're moving. It constantly updates this with information from your eyes and vestibular system. The vestibular system is a network of nerves, channels and fluids in your inner ear, which gives your brain a sense of motion and balance. If there\u2019s a mismatch of information between these two systems, your brain can't update your current status and the resulting confusion will lead to symptoms of motion sickness, such as nausea and vomiting. For example, you can get motion sickness when travelling by car because your eyes tell your brain that you're travelling at more than 30 miles an hour, but your vestibular system tells your brain that you're sitting still. There's also an association between motion sickness and a type of migraine where dizziness, rather than headache, dominates. This is known as a vestibular migraine. If you experience dizzy spells and have a history of motion sickness, you may be diagnosed as having vestibular migraines. Treating motion sickness Mild symptoms of motion sickness can usually be improved using techniques such as fixing your eyes on the horizon or distracting yourself by listening to music. Other self care techniques you could try include: Keep still \u2013 if possible, choose a cabin or seat in the middle of a boat or plane, because this is where you'll experience the least movement. Use a pillow or headrest to help keep your head as still as possible. Look at a stable object \u2013 for example, the horizon. Reading or playing games may make your symptoms worse. Closing your eyes may help relieve symptoms. Fresh air \u2013 open windows or move to the top deck of a ship to avoid getting too hot and to get a good supply of fresh air. Relax \u2013 by listening to music while focusing on your breathing or carrying out a mental activity, such as counting backwards from 100. Stay calm \u2013 keep calm about the journey. You\u2019re more likely to get motion sickness if you worry about it. It\u2019s also a good idea to avoid eating a large meal or drinking alcohol before travelling. You should keep well hydrated throughout your journey by drinking water. Medication More severe motion sickness can be treated with medication. It's usually better to take medication for motion sickness before your journey to prevent symptoms developing. Hyoscine Hyoscine, also known as scopolamine, is widely used to treat motion sickness. It's thought to work by blocking some of the nerve signals sent from the vestibular system. Hyoscine is available over the counter from pharmacists. To be effective, you'll need to take it before travelling. If you're going on a long journey \u2013 for example, by sea \u2013 hyoscine patches can be applied to your skin every three days. Common side effects of hyoscine include drowsiness, blurred vision and dizziness. As hyoscine can cause drowsiness, avoid taking it if you're planning to drive. Hyoscine should also be used with caution in children, the elderly, and if you have certain conditions such as epilepsy or a history of heart, kidney or liver problems. Antihistamines Antihistamines are used to treat symptoms of allergies, but can also help to control nausea and vomiting. They\u2019re less effective at treating motion sickness than hyoscine, but may cause fewer side effects. They\u2019re usually taken as tablets one or two hours before your journey. If it's a long journey, you may need to take a dose every eight hours. Like hyoscine, some antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Your pharmacist can advise you. Complementary therapies Several complementary therapies have been suggested for motion sickness, although the evidence for their effectiveness is mixed. Ginger Ginger supplements, or other ginger products including ginger biscuits or ginger tea, may help to prevent symptoms of motion sickness. Ginger is sometimes used to treat other types of nausea, such as morning sickness during pregnancy. Although there's little scientific evidence to support the use of ginger to treat motion sickness, it has a long history of being used as a remedy for nausea and vomiting. Before taking ginger supplements, check with your GP that they won't affect any other medication you're taking. Acupressure bands Acupressure bands are stretchy bands worn around the wrists. They apply pressure to a particular point on the inside of your wrist between the two tendons on your inner arm. Some complementary therapists claim that using an acupressure band can help to treat motion sickness. Although acupressure bands don't cause any adverse side effects, there's little scientific evidence to show they're an effective treatment for motion sickness.

This leads to muscle weakness, often with visible wasting. Motor neurone disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), occurs when specialist nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord called motor neurones stop working properly. This is known as neurodegeneration. Motor neurones control important muscle activity, such as: gripping walking speaking swallowing breathing As the condition progresses, people with motor neurone disease will find some or all of these activities increasingly difficult. Eventually, they may become impossible. It's not clear what causes motor neurones to stop working properly. In about 5% of cases there's a family history of either motor neurone disease or a related condition called frontotemporal dementia. This is known as familial motor neurone disease. In most of these cases, faulty genes have been identified as making a major contribution to the development of the condition. There's no single test to diagnose motor neurone disease and diagnosis is based mainly on the opinion of a brain and nervous system specialist (a neurologist). The diagnosis of motor neurone disease is usually clear to an experienced neurologist, but sometimes specialised tests are needed to rule out other conditions with similar features. Read more about the causes of motor neurone disease and diagnosing motor neurone disease. Progression of symptoms The symptoms of motor neurone disease begin gradually over weeks and months, usually on one side of the body initially, and get progressively worse. Common early symptoms include: a weakened grip, which can cause difficulty picking up or holding objects weakness at the shoulder that makes lifting the arm difficult a \"foot drop\" caused by weak ankle muscles dragging of the leg slurred speech (dysarthria) The condition isn't usually painful. As damage progresses, symptoms spread to other parts of the body and the condition becomes more debilitating. Eventually, a person with motor neurone disease may be unable to move. Communicating, swallowing and breathing may also become very difficult. In up to 15% of cases, motor neurone disease is associated with a type of dementia that can affect personality and behaviour. This is called frontotemporal dementia, and is often an early feature when it occurs in motor neurone disease. The affected person may not realise that their personality or behaviour is different. Who's affected by motor neurone disease? Motor neurone disease is a rare condition that affects around two in every 100,000 people in the UK each year. There are about 5,000 people living with the condition in the UK at any one time. The condition can affect adults of all ages, including teenagers, although this is extremely rare. It's usually diagnosed in people over 40, but most people with the condition first develop symptoms in their 60s. It affects slightly more men than women. Treating motor neurone disease There's currently no cure for motor neurone disease. Treatment aims to: make the person feel comfortable and have the best quality of life possible compensate for the progressive loss of bodily functions such as mobility, communication, swallowing and breathing For example, a breathing mask can greatly help the symptoms of breathing and weakness, and a feeding tube (called a gastrostomy) helps maintain nutrition and overall comfort. If necessary, medication can be used to help control excessive drooling. A medication called riluzole has shown a very small improvement in patients' overall survival, but it isn't a cure and doesn't stop the condition progressing. Read more about treating motor neurone disease. Survival rates Motor neurone disease is a severely life-shortening condition for most people. Life expectancy for about half of those with the condition is three years from the start of symptoms. However, some people may live for up to 10 years, and in rarer circumstances even longer. Living with motor neurone disease is extremely challenging and often a terrifying possibility before the diagnosis is made. However, it's not necessarily as bleak as people imagine. With strong community and specialist support, many people can maintain some independence for a significant part of the condition's course, and experience a quality of life they may not have imagined was possible at the time of their diagnosis. The end of life for someone with motor neurone disease isn't usually distressing and is most often in their own home. In most cases, a person with the condition will die in their sleep as the end stage of gradual weakness in their breathing muscles. Although some people with the condition will have swallowing problems, they won't choke to death. Advice and support The Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA) is the leading UK charity for people affected by the condition. The MNDA can give you information, practical advice and support about living with motor neurone disease and coping with the emotional impact of being diagnosed. The MNDA also run a network of specialist hospital clinics across the UK, where a neurologist who's an expert in motor neurone disease can provide you with further information and advice. Information about you If you have motor neurone disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

The decrease in atmospheric pressure makes breathing difficult because you aren't able to take in as much oxygen. Most cases are mild, with symptoms that can include: headache   nausea dizziness exhaustion In rare cases, altitude sickness can cause fluid to build up either on the lungs or the brain. These are very serious conditions and require immediate medical attention. Symptoms of severe altitude sickness can include: a bubbling sound in the chest worsening breathlessness  coughing up pink, frothy liquid clumsiness and difficulty walking confusion leading to loss of consciousness Read more about the symptoms of altitude sickness and the complications of altitude sickness. What to do if you have symptoms If you have mild symptoms of altitude sickness, you shouldn't go any higher for at least 24 to 48 hours. You can continue to climb if your symptoms improve after this. If your symptoms get worse or don't improve after 24 to 48 hours, you should descend by at least 500m. Severe altitude sickness is a medical emergency. Someone with severe symptoms should immediately descend to a low altitude and seek medical help. Read more about treating altitude sickness. Preventing altitude sickness Proper acclimatisation to altitudes of about 2,500m (just over 8,200 feet) or more is the best way to prevent altitude sickness. It usually takes a few days for the body to get used to a change in altitude. Ascending slowly will give your body time to adapt to the change in altitude. For example, once you're above 3,000m (10,000 feet) try not to increase the altitude at which you sleep by more than 300-500m a night. Keeping hydrated is also important, but make sure you avoid alcohol. Read more about preventing altitude sickness. Who's affected by altitude sickness? Altitude sickness is fairly common among those who spend time at high altitudes, such as mountaineers and skiers. In its mildest form, altitude sickness can occur at heights over about 2,500m (8,000 feet) above sea level, which is a common height for many ski resorts. However, the more severe symptoms of altitude sickness tend to occur at altitudes of 3,600m (about 12,000 feet) and above. It's not possible to get altitude sickness in the UK because the highest mountain, Ben Nevis in Scotland, is only 1,344m (4,406 feet) high. There are no specific factors, such as age, sex or physical fitness, that increase a person's likelihood of getting altitude sickness. Certain people are affected, while others are less susceptible to it. Just because you haven't had it before doesn't mean you won't develop it on another trip.

Tumours can also occur in the salivary glands, tonsils and the pharynx (the part of the throat from your mouth to your windpipe) but these are less common. Symptoms of mouth cancer include: red or white patches on the lining of your mouth or tongue ulcers a lump See your GP if these symptoms do not heal within three weeks, especially if you're a heavy drinker or smoker. Types of mouth cancer A cancer that develops on the inside or outside layer of the body is called a carcinoma and these types of cancer are categorised by the type of cells the cancer starts in. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of mouth cancer, accounting for nine out of 10 cases. Squamous cells are found in many places around the body, including the inside of the mouth and under the skin. Less common types of mouth cancer include: oral malignant melanoma \u2013 where the cancer starts in cells called melanocytes, which help give skin its colour adenocarcinomas \u2013 cancers that develop inside the salivary glands What causes mouth cancer? Mouth cancer occurs when something goes wrong with the normal cell lifecycle, causing them to grow and reproduce uncontrollably. Risk factors for developing mouth cancer include: smoking or using products that contain tobacco drinking alcohol \u2013 smokers who are also heavy drinkers have a much higher risk compared to the population at large infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV), the virus that causes genital warts Read more about the causes of mouth cancer. Who is affected by mouth cancer? Mouth cancer is an uncommon type of cancer, accounting for one in 50 of all cancer cases. In the UK, just over 6,767 new cases of mouth cancer were diagnosed in 2011 (the latest reliable data). Most cases of mouth cancer first develop in older adults who are between 50-74 years of age. Mouth cancer can occur in younger adults, but it's thought that HPV infection may be responsible for the majority of cases that occur in younger people. Mouth cancer is more common in men than in women. This is thought to be due to the fact that, on average, men drink more alcohol than women. Treating mouth cancer There are three main treatment options for mouth cancer. They are: surgery \u2013 where the cancerous cells are surgically removed and, in some cases, some of the surrounding tissue chemotherapy \u2013 where powerful medications are used to kill cancerous cells radiotherapy \u2013 where high energy X-rays are used to kill cancerous cells These treatments are often used in combination. For example, a course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be given after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning. Read more about treating mouth cancer. Complications of mouth cancer Both surgery and radiotherapy can make speaking and swallowing difficult (dysphagia). Dysphagia can be a potentially serious problem. If small pieces of food enter your airways and become lodged in your lungs, it could trigger a chest infection, known as aspiration pneumonia. Read more about the complications of mouth cancer. Reducing the risk The three most effective ways to prevent mouth cancer from developing \u2013 or prevent it reocurring after successful treatment \u2013 are: not smoking keeping to the recommended weekly limits for alcohol consumption (21 units for men and 14 units for women (read more about alcohol units) eating a 'Mediterranean-style diet', with plenty of fresh vegetables (particularly tomatoes), citrus fruits, olive oil and fish (read more about healthy eating) It's also important that you have regular dental check-ups because dentists can often spot the early stages of mouth cancer. Outlook If mouth cancer is diagnosed early, a complete cure is often possible using a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. The outlook for mouth cancer can vary depending on which part of the mouth is affected and whether it has spread from the mouth into surrounding tissue. The outlook is much better if the cancer is diagnosed early. Overall, an estimated 40% of people with cancer affecting the mouth and pharyx will live at least five years after their diagnosis and many people live much longer. However, the outlook is better for cancer affecting certain areas of the mouth, such as the lip, tongue or oral cavity. Mouth cancer Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

Although they're uncomfortable, they\u2019re usually harmless and most clear up by themselves within a week or two. Mouth ulcers are common and can usually be managed at home, without seeing your dentist or GP. Visit your pharmacist first, unless your ulcer has lasted longer than three weeks. What does a mouth ulcer look like? Mouth ulcers are usually round or oval sores that commonly appear inside the mouth on the: cheeks lips tongue They can be white, red, yellow or grey in colour and swollen. It's possible to have more than one mouth ulcer at a time and they may spread or grow. Mouth ulcers shouldn't be confused with cold sores, which are small blisters that develop on the lips or around the mouth. Cold sores often begin with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. When to see your pharmacist, dentist or GP Mouth ulcers can be painful, which can make it uncomfortable to eat, drink or brush your teeth. It's usually safe to treat mouth ulcers at home. See your GP or dentist if: your mouth ulcer has lasted three weeks you keep getting mouth ulcers your mouth ulcer becomes more painful or red \u2013 this could be a sign of a bacterial infection, which may need treatment with antibiotics Mouth ulcers are also a possible symptom of a viral infection that mainly affects young children, called hand, foot and mouth disease. Speak to your GP or call NHS 111 if you're unsure. Read about the symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease. How to treat mouth ulcers Mouth ulcers don\u2019t usually need to be treated, because they tend to clear up by themselves within a week or two. However, treatment can help to reduce swelling and ease any discomfort. This may help if you keep getting mouth ulcers or your mouth ulcer affects eating and drinking. Self care Things you can do to speed up healing include: applying a protective paste recommended by your pharmacist using a soft toothbrush to brush your teeth using a toothpaste that doesn\u2019t contain sodium lauryl sulphate, as this may be irritating  avoiding hard, spicy, salty, acidic or hot food and drink until the ulcer heals using a straw to drink cool drinks avoiding things that may be triggering your mouth ulcers \u2013 see causes, below Pharmacy medicines You can buy several types of mouth ulcer treatment from a pharmacy. Speak to your pharmacist about the best treatment for you. Options include the following: Antimicrobial mouthwash may speed up healing and prevent infection of the ulcer. Children under two shouldn't use this treatment. It also contains chlorexidine gluconate, which may stain teeth \u2013 but this may fade once treatment is finished.  Painkillers are available as a mouthwash, lozenge, gel or spray. They can sting on first use and your mouth may feel numb \u2013 but this is temporary. Mouthwash can be diluted with water if stinging continues. Children under 12 shouldn\u2019t use mouthwash or gel. Mouthwash shouldn\u2019t be used for more than seven days in a row. Corticosteroid lozenges may reduce pain and speed up healing. These are best used as soon as the ulcer appears, but shouldn't be used by children under 12. Medicines from your dentist or GP If necessary, you may be prescribed a course of stronger corticosteroids to help reduce pain and swelling, and speed up healing. Corticosteroids are available on prescription as tablets, mouthwash, paste or spray, but are not suitable for children under 12. Is it mouth cancer? In a few cases, a long-lasting mouth ulcer can be a sign of mouth cancer. Ulcers caused by mouth cancer usually appear on or under the tongue, although you can get them in other areas of the mouth. Risk factors for mouth cancer include: smoking or using products that contain tobacco drinking alcohol \u2013 smokers who are also heavy drinkers have a much higher risk compared to the population at large infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV) \u2013 the virus that causes genital warts It's important to detect mouth cancer as early as possible. If mouth cancer is detected early, the chances of a complete recovery are good. Regular dental check-ups are the best way to detect the early signs. What causes mouth ulcers? In many cases, the reason for mouth ulcers is unclear. Most single mouth ulcers are caused by damage to the lining inside of the mouth. For example: accidentally biting the inside of your cheek or a sharp tooth poorly fitting dentures hard food a defective filling It\u2019s not always clear what causes mouth ulcers that keep returning, but triggers are thought to include: stress and anxiety  hormonal changes \u2013 some women develop mouth ulcers during their monthly period eating certain foods \u2013 such as chocolate, spicy foods, coffee, peanuts, almonds, strawberries, cheese, tomatoes and wheat flour toothpaste containing sodium lauryl sulphate stopping smoking \u2013 when you first stop smoking, you may develop mouth ulcers Your genes are also thought to have a role \u2013 around 40% of people who keep getting mouth ulcers report that it runs in their family. Medical conditions Mouth ulcers can sometimes be caused by certain medical conditions, such as: viral infections \u2013 including the cold sore virus, chickenpox, and hand, foot and mouth disease vitamin B12 or iron deficiency Crohn's disease \u2013 a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system coeliac disease \u2013 a common digestive condition where a person has an adverse reaction to gluten reactive arthritis \u2013 a condition that causes inflammation in various places in the body, usually as a reaction to an infection weakened immune system \u2013 for example, due to HIV or lupus Behçet\u2019s disease \u2013 a rare and poorly understood condition that also causes swelling of the blood vessels Medications and treatments Mouth ulcers can sometimes be caused by certain medications or treatments, such as: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \u2013 such as ibuprofen nicorandil \u2013 a medication sometimes used to treat angina beta-blockers \u2013 used to treat conditions such as angina, high blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythms a side effect of chemotherapy or radiotherapy \u2013 this is known as mucositis Can mouth ulcers be prevented? It may not be possible to prevent mouth ulcers, because they're often caused by things you can't control (such as a family history or a medical condition). However, the following may help to reduce your risk of developing mouth ulcers: avoiding certain foods \u2013 such as chocolate, spicy foods, coffee, peanuts, almonds, strawberries, cheese, tomatoes and wheat flour, if they cause you to have an ulcer not chewing gum brushing your teeth with a soft-bristled brush, which may reduce irritation in your mouth using toothpaste that doesn\u2019t contain sodium lauryl sulphate reducing stress and anxiety \u2013 which may be a trigger for some people Read more advice on dental health.  Page last reviewed: 15\/03\/2016 Next review due: 15\/03\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Hands-only CPR To carry out a chest compression: Place the heel of your hand on the breastbone at the centre of the person\u2019s chest. Place your other hand on top of your first hand and interlock your fingers. Position yourself with your shoulders above your hands. Using your body weight (not just your arms), press straight down by 5-6cm (2-2.5 inches) on their chest. Keeping your hands on their chest, release the compression and allow the chest to return to its original position.   Repeat these compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 times per minute until an ambulance arrives or you become exhausted. When you call for an ambulance, telephone systems now exist that can give basic life-saving instructions, including advice about CPR. These are now common and are easily accessible with mobile phones. CPR with rescue breaths If you\u2019ve been trained in CPR, including rescue breaths, and feel confident using your skills, you should give chest compressions with rescue breaths. If you're not completely confident, attempt hands-only CPR instead (see above). Adults Place the heel of your hand on the centre of the person's chest, then place the other hand on top and press down by 5-6cm (2-2.5 inches) at a steady rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute. After every 30 chest compressions, give two rescue breaths. Tilt the casualty's head gently and lift the chin up with two fingers. Pinch the person\u2019s nose. Seal your mouth over their mouth and blow steadily and firmly into their mouth for about one second. Check that their chest rises. Give two rescue breaths. Continue with cycles of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until they begin to recover or emergency help arrives. Children over one year old Open the child's airway by placing one hand on the child\u2019s forehead and gently tilting their head back and lifting the chin. Remove any visible obstructions from the mouth and nose. Pinch their nose. Seal your mouth over their mouth and blow steadily and firmly into their mouth, checking that their chest rises. Give five initial rescue breaths. Place the heel of one hand on the centre of their chest and push down by 5cm (about two inches), which is approximately one-third of the chest diameter. The quality (depth) of chest compressions is very important. Use two hands if you can't achieve a depth of 5cm using one hand. After every 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute, give two breaths. Continue with cycles of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until they begin to recover or emergency help arrives. Infants under one year old Open the infant's airway by placing one hand on their forehead and gently tilting the head back and lifting the chin. Remove any visible obstructions from the mouth and nose. Place your mouth over the mouth and nose of the infant and blow steadily and firmly into their mouth, checking that their chest rises. Give five initial rescue breaths. Place two fingers in the middle of the chest and push down by 4cm (about 1.5 inches), which is approximately one-third of the chest diameter. The quality (depth) of chest compressions is very important. Use the heel of one hand if you can't achieve a depth of 4cm using the tips of two fingers. After 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute, give two rescue breaths. Continue with cycles of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until they begin to recover or emergency help arrives.

An MRI scanner is a large tube that contains powerful magnets. You lie inside the tube during the scan. An MRI scan can be used to examine almost any part of the body, including the: brain and spinal cord bones and joints breasts heart and blood vessels internal organs, such as the liver, womb or prostate gland  The results of an MRI scan can be used to help diagnose conditions, plan treatments and assess how effective previous treatment has been. Read a guide to NHS waiting times. What happens during an MRI scan? During an MRI scan, you lie on a flat bed that's moved into the scanner. Depending on the part of your body being scanned, you'll be moved into the scanner either head first or feet first. The MRI scanner is operated by a radiographer, who is trained in carrying out imaging investigations. They control the scanner using a computer, which is in a different room, to keep it away from the magnetic field generated by the scanner. You'll be able to talk to the radiographer through an intercom and they'll be able to see you on a television monitor throughout the scan. At certain times during the scan, the scanner will make loud tapping noises. This is the electric current in the scanner coils being turned on and off. You'll be given earplugs or headphones to wear. It's very important to keep as still as possible during your MRI scan. The scan lasts 15 to 90 minutes, depending on the size of the area being scanned and how many images are taken. Read more about how an MRI scan is performed. How does an MRI scan work? Most of the human body is made up of water molecules, which consist of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. At the centre of each hydrogen atom is an even smaller particle, called a proton. Protons are like tiny magnets and are very sensitive to magnetic fields. When you lie under the powerful scanner magnets, the protons in your body line up in the same direction, in the same way that a magnet can pull the needle of a compass. Short bursts of radio waves are then sent to certain areas of the body, knocking the protons out of alignment. When the radio waves are turned off, the protons realign. This sends out radio signals, which are picked up by receivers. These signals provide information about the exact location of the protons in the body. They also help to distinguish between the various types of tissue in the body, because the protons in different types of tissue realign at different speeds and produce distinct signals. In the same way that millions of pixels on a computer screen can create complex pictures, the signals from the millions of protons in the body are combined to create a detailed image of the inside of the body. Safety An MRI scan is a painless and safe procedure. You may find it uncomfortable if you have claustrophobia, but most people find this manageable with support from the radiographer. Going into the scanner feet first may be easier, although this is not always possible. MRI scans don't involve exposing the body to X-ray radiation. This means people who may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of radiation, such as pregnant women and babies, can use them if necessary. However, not everyone can have an MRI scan. For example, they're not always possible for people who have certain types of implants fitted, such as a pacemaker (a battery-operated device that helps to control an irregular heartbeat). Extensive research has been carried out into whether the magnetic fields and radio waves used during MRI scans could pose a risk to the human body. No evidence has been found to suggest there's a risk, which means MRI scans are one of the safest medical procedures currently available. Read more about who can and can't have an MRI scan.

This means MRSA infections can be more difficult to treat than other bacterial infections.  The full name of MRSA is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. You may have heard it called a \"superbug\". Staphylococcus aureus (also known as staph) is a common type of bacteria. It's often carried on the skin and inside the nostrils and throat, and can cause mild infections of the skin, such as boils and impetigo. If the bacteria get into a break in the skin, they can cause life-threatening infections, such as blood poisoning or endocarditis. Read more about the symptoms of an MRSA infection. How do you get MRSA? MRSA bacteria are usually spread through skin-to-skin contact with someone who has an MRSA infection or has the bacteria living on their skin. The bacteria can also be spread through contact with contaminated objects such towels, sheets, clothes, dressings, surfaces, door handles and floors. People staying in hospital are most at risk of becoming infected with MRSA because: they're surrounded by a large number of people, which means the bacteria can spread more easily they often have an entry point for the bacteria to get into their body, such as a surgical wound or urinary catheter they may have serious or complex health problems, which makes them more vulnerable to infection It's also possible to become infected with MRSA outside of hospital, although this is much less common. Read more about the possible causes of MRSA.  Preventing MRSA In recent years, rates of MRSA have fallen because of increased awareness of the infection by both medical staff and the public. However, MRSA still places a considerable strain on healthcare services. Some people who need to be admitted to hospital will have MRSA screening beforehand (see below), but there are also some things you can do yourself to reduce your risk of becoming infected. These include: washing your hands frequently \u2013 especially after using the toilet, and before and after eating following any advice you're given about wound care and devices that could lead to infection (such as urinary catheters) reporting any unclean toilet or bathroom facilities to staff \u2013 don't be afraid to talk to staff if you're concerned about hygiene If you're visiting someone in hospital, you can reduce the chance of spreading MRSA by cleaning your hands before and after entering the ward. You should also use hand wipes or hand gel before touching the person you're visiting. Read more about preventing MRSA. Screening for MRSA Some patients admitted to hospital for planned or emergency care are screened to see if they carry MRSA on their skin. This helps to reduce the chance of patients developing an MRSA infection or passing an infection on to other patients. During the screening process, a cotton bud (swab) will be run over your skin, so it can be checked for MRSA bacteria. Swabs may be taken from different places, such as the inside of your nose, your throat, armpit, groin and any areas of damaged or open skin. If MRSA bacteria are found, treatment with antibacterial bodywash or shampoo and nasal cream to remove the bacteria from your skin will usually need to be carried out before you're admitted. Read more about MRSA screening. Treating MRSA infections Although MRSA infections can be more difficult to treat than other bacterial infections, they're still treatable because the MRSA bacteria aren't resistant to all antibiotics. Minor skin infections may not always require any treatment, other than draining away any pus from the site of the infection, but in most other cases you'll be treated with antibiotics that MRSA has not yet developed resistance to. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, antibiotic tablets or injections will be used and you may need to have a combination of antibiotics or take types of antibiotics that are rarely used for less serious infections.

It's a lifelong condition that can sometimes cause serious disability, although it can occasionally be mild. In many cases, it\u2019s possible to treat symptoms. Average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with MS. It's estimated that there are more than 100,000 people diagnosed with MS in the UK. It's most commonly diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s, although it can develop at any age. It's about two to three times more common in women than men. Symptoms of MS The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person and can affect any part of the body. The main symptoms include: fatigue difficulty walking vision problems, such as blurred vision problems controlling the bladder numbness or tingling in different parts of the body muscle stiffness and spasms problems with balance and co-ordination problems with thinking, learning and planning Depending on the type of MS you have (see below), your symptoms may come and go in phases, or get steadily worse over time (progress). Read more about the symptoms of MS. Getting medical advice See your GP if you're worried you might have early signs of MS. The early symptoms often have many other causes, so they're not necessarily a sign of MS. Let your GP know about the specific pattern of symptoms you\u2019re experiencing. If you GP thinks you could have MS, you'll be referred to a neurologist (a specialist in conditions of the nervous system), who may suggest tests such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to check for features of MS. Read more about diagnosing MS. Types of MS MS starts in one of two general ways: with individual relapses (attacks or exacerbations) or with gradual progression. Relapsing-remitting MS More than 8 out of every 10 people with MS are diagnosed with the \"relapsing remitting\" type. Someone with relapsing remitting MS will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, known as \"relapses\". These typically worsen over a few days, last for days to weeks to months, then slowly improve over a similar time period. Relapses often occur without warning, but are sometimes associated with a period of illness or stress. The symptoms of a relapse may disappear altogether, with or without treatment, although some symptoms often persist, with repeated attacks happening over several years. Periods between attacks are known as periods of \"remission\". These can last for years at a time. After many years (usually decades), many, but not all people, with relapsing remitting MS go on to develop secondary progressive MS. In this type of MS, symptoms gradually worsen over time without obvious attacks. Some people continue to have infrequent relapses during this stage. Around half of people with relapsing remitting MS will develop secondary progressive MS within 15-20 years, and the risk of this happening increases the longer you have the condition. Primary progressive MS Just over 1 in 10 people with the condition start their MS with a gradual worsening of symptoms. In primary progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and accumulate over several years, and there are no periods of remission, though people often have periods where their condition appears to stabilise. What causes MS? MS is an autoimmune condition. This is when something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks a healthy part of the body \u2013 in this case, the brain or spinal cord of the nervous system. In MS, the immune system attacks the layer that surrounds and protects the nerves, called the myelin sheath. This damages and scars the sheath, and potentially the underlying nerves, meaning that messages travelling along the nerves become slowed or disrupted. Exactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is unclear, but most experts think a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved. Read more about the causes of MS. Treatments for MS There's currently no cure for MS, but a number of treatments can help control the condition. The treatment you need will depend on the specific symptoms and difficulties you have. It may include: treating relapses with short courses of steroid medication to speed up recovery specific treatments for individual MS symptoms treatment to reduce the number of relapses with medicines called disease-modifying therapies Disease-modifying therapies may also help to slow or reduce the overall worsening of disability of MS in people with relapsing remitting MS, and in people with secondary progressive MS who are still having relapses. Unfortunately, there's currently no treatment that can slow the progress of primary progressive MS or secondary progressive MS in the absence of relapses. Many therapies aiming to treat progressive MS are currently being researched. Read more about how MS is treated and living with MS. Outlook MS can be a challenging condition to live with, but new treatments over the past 20 years have considerably improved the quality of life of people with the condition. MS itself is rarely fatal, but complications may arise from severe MS, such as chest or bladder infections, or swallowing difficulties. The average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average, and this gap appears to be getting smaller all the time. MS charities and support groups There are two main MS charities in the UK: MS Society MS Trust These organisations offer useful advice, publications, news items about ongoing research, blogs and chatrooms. They can be very useful if you, or someone you know, has just been diagnosed with MS. There is also the shift.ms website which is an online community for younger people affected by MS.

The mucous membrane is the soft layer of tissue lining the digestive system from the mouth to the anus. Mucositis is a relatively common side effect of chemotherapy. It's also sometimes caused by radiotherapy, especially if it involves the head or neck. It's often divided into two main types, including: oral mucositis \u2013 which can cause mouth ulcers (sores) and pain or difficulty swallowing gastrointestinal mucositis \u2013 which occurs inside the digestive system and often causes diarrhoea It's also possible for mucositis to affect the lining of the anus \u2013 a condition known as proctitis. What are the symptoms or oral mucositis? The symptoms of oral mucositis usually begin five to 10 days after starting chemotherapy, or 14 days after starting radiotherapy. The tissue inside your mouth will start to feel sore, as if you have been burnt by eating hot food. It's also likely you will develop white patches or ulcers on the lining of your mouth and, in some cases, on your tongue and around your lips. These ulcers may become very painful and may make it difficult for you to eat, drink or talk. You may also have a dry mouth and a reduced sense of taste. These changes in your mouth can make it more difficult to speak. Relatives and friends may notice your breath smells bad (halitosis). Milder symptoms of oral mucositis should ease three to four weeks after your course of chemotherapy or radiotherapy has finished. More severe cases will usually require hospital treatment for monitoring and nutritional support. What are the symptoms of gastrointestinal mucositis? The symptoms of gastrointestinal mucositis are more common in people receiving chemotherapy, although they may also occur if you've had radiotherapy to treat cancer in your abdominal (tummy) or pelvic area. The symptoms of gastrointestinal mucositis usually begin 14 days after you start your chemotherapy or radiotherapy. They can include: diarrhoea ulcers in your anus and rectum rectal bleeding, which can cause blood in your stools passing mucus from your anus (back passage) abdominal pain difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) nausea (feeling sick) bloating Most of these symptoms will stop a few weeks after your treatment has finished, although occasionally the symptoms of diarrhoea can persist for several months after radiotherapy has finished. Why does mucositis happen? The digestive tract is more prone to the harmful effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, which can damage the delicate lining. If you're undergoing cancer treatment that could potentially cause mucositis, you'll be checked regularly for the condition. Mucositis can usually be diagnosed after an examination or a description of your symptoms. Read more about the causes of mucositis and diagnosing mucositis. Who is affected? It's estimated that around 40% of people receiving chemotherapy as part of their cancer treatment will develop some degree of mucositis. It can be more severe in some people, depending on the treatment used. Mucositis is more common among certain types of cancer. For example, it's estimated that up to 97% of people who have radiotherapy for head or neck cancer will develop some form of mucositis. About 70% of people receiving high doses of chemotherapy because they are undergoing a stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant) will develop mucositis. How is mucositis treated? The main aim of treatment for oral mucositis is to prevent infection and reduce any pain. This is done by using painkillers and practising good oral hygiene. Treatments are also available to reduce the symptoms of oral mucositis, such as low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and a medication called palifermin. Treatment for gastrointestinal mucositis aims to reduce the main symptoms of the condition, such as diarrhoea and inflammation. Treatment includes a combination of medicines and self-care measures. The symptoms of mucositis should begin to improve a few weeks after chemotherapy or radiotherapy has finished, although it can sometimes take longer. Read more about treating mucositis. Complications The most serious cases of mucositis can lead to a number of associated health complications. Many people with mucositis find it painful to swallow food and require alternative feeding methods, such as a feeding tube. Also, mouth ulcers can become infected with bacteria. The infection can spread to the blood, then on to other organs. This is known as sepsis and can be life-threatening. Can mucositis be prevented? It's not always possible to prevent mucositis, but some treatments can be taken during radiotherapy or chemotherapy to try to reduce the severity of mucositis or how long it lasts.  Treatments include medications such as palifermin, benzydamine, sulfasalazine and amifostine.

They're often a sign of a fungal nail infection or injury, but can sometimes indicate a more serious underlying disease. Visit your GP if your nails have changed in colour, texture, shape or thickness and you don't know why (you haven't injured your nails or been biting them). This guide gives the most likely reasons for the following nail problems: brittle or crumbly nails  discoloured nails  white nails  thickened, overgrown nails  loose nails  indented spoon-shaped nails  pitting or dents on the nails  grooves going across the width of the nails  unusually curved fingertips and nails  white lines running across the nails  dark stripes running down the nail  red or brown little streaks under the nails  a destroyed nail  infected nail fold (painful, red and swollen skin next to the nail) Brittle or crumbly nails Brittle nails are often just a sign of ageing or long-term exposure to water or chemicals such as detergents and nail polish. Nails can be strengthened by taking biotin (vitamin B7) supplements, by wearing gloves for all wet work and by frequently applying moisturising cream to the nails. Sometimes, brittle or crumbly nails can be caused by: a fungal nail infection, which can be cleared by taking a course of antifungal tablets (this especially tends to be the cause for crumbly toenails) a skin condition called lichen planus, which can just affect the nails an underactive thyroid or overactive thyroid, where the thyroid gland either doesn't produce enough hormones or produces too many nail psoriasis, a long-term skin condition that can cause the nails to become crumbly A less common cause of crumbly nails is reactive arthritis, an unusual reaction of the immune system affecting the joints, muscles and other parts of the body following an infection. If you have a combination of symptoms affecting different parts of your body, your GP might consider this condition. Discoloured nails The most common causes of a yellow nail are fungal nail infections or nail psoriasis. Yellow nails can also result from any of the following: frequent application of nail varnish lymphoedema, a long-term condition that causes swelling of the skin permanent damage to your airways caused by bronchiectasis (a long-term lung condition) sinusitis (inflammation of the lining of the sinuses) inflammation of the thyroid gland, found in the neck tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial infection affecting the lungs jaundice (yellowing of the skin) due to liver disease some drugs, such as mepacrine or carotene   chronic paronychia (infection of the nail fold) Green-black nails can be caused by overgrowth of bacteria called pseudomonas, especially under loose nails. This can be treated by applying antibiotic eye drops underneath the nails or soaking the affected nails in an antiseptic solution or vinegar. Grey nails can be caused by medication such as antimalarials or minocycline. Brown nails can sometimes be caused by thyroid disease, pregnancy, malnutrition and frequent use of nail varnish. Red or yellow drop under the nail If the discolouration looks like a drop of oil under the nail plate or is the colour of salmon, you may have psoriasis of the nails. Half white, half brown nails Fingernails that are half white and half brown (brown near the tips) can be a sign of kidney failure, where the kidneys stop working properly. The link is not fully understood, but one theory is that kidney failure causes chemical changes in the blood that encourage melanin (a skin pigment) to be released into the nail bed. It's also possible that kidney failure causes an increase in the number of tiny blood vessels in the nail bed. It's estimated up to 40% of people with kidney failure have \"half-and-half\" fingernails. Half-and-half nails have also been seen in some people with AIDS and can be seen following chemotherapy. White nails If most of the nail plate has turned white and it's not because the nail has become detached from the nail bed, it's likely to be either a fungal nail infection or a sign of decreased blood supply to the nail bed, known as \"Terry's nails\". Terry's nails are typically white with reddened or dark tips and can be a sign of a wide range of medical conditions, including the following: liver cirrhosis (scarring and damage to the liver) \u2013 about 80% of people with cirrhosis have Terry's nails liver, kidney or heart failure diabetes iron-deficiency anaemia \u2013 a reduced number of red blood cells due to a lack of iron in the body chemotherapy an overactive thyroid (where the thyroid gland in your neck produces too many hormones) malnutrition  Thickened, overgrown nails A common cause of thickened nails is a fungal nail infection. This can also cause them to discolour and become crumbly (see above). Other possible causes of thickened or overgrown nails are: psoriasis, a long-term condition that tends to also cause red, flaky patches of skin long-term pressure from shoes that are either too small or too narrow over the toes reactive arthritis, where the immune system attacks the joints, muscles and other parts of the body following an infection Severely overgrown horn-like nails Sometimes, the big toenails become so overgrown and thickened that they resemble claws and are almost impossible to cut with conventional nail clippers. This nail disorder is known as onychogryphosis (\"ram's horn nails\"), and is seen in older people or as a response to long-term pressure on the nails. Regular chiropody can help, but sometimes the nails need to be removed by a podiatrist or doctor. Loose nails It's normal for a toenail to come loose and fall off after an injury to the toe. However, if you haven't injured your nail, a loose nail is often caused by over-manicuring the nails and cleaning under the nails with a sharp object. Less commonly, it may be a sign of one of the following health conditions: a fungal nail infection psoriasis of the nail \u2013 psoriasis is a long-term condition that tends to also cause red, flaky patches of skin warts that cluster around the fingernail an overactive thyroid, which means the thyroid gland in the neck is producing too many hormones  sarcoidosis, a condition where small clumps of cells form in the organs and tissues of the body amyloidosis, where protein builds up in the organs a problem with the connective tissue fibres in the body that support the organs and body tissues poor circulation, for example caused by smoking or Raynaud's disease  an allergic reaction to medicine (usually to a type of antibiotic) or nail cosmetics A loose nail should be cut back to where it's detached to allow the nail to become reattached as it grows. You shouldn't clean your nails with anything other than a soft nailbrush. Indented spoon-shaped nails (koilonychia) If your fingernails curve inwards like spoons (known medically as koilonychia), you may have one of the following disorders: iron-deficiency anaemia, which is a reduced number of red blood cells due to a lack of iron in the body haemochromatosis, where the body contains too much iron Raynaud\u2019s disease, a common condition affecting the blood supply to the fingers and toes, causing them to turn white  lupus erythematosus, an uncommon condition where the immune system attacks the body's cells, tissues and organs Pitting or dents on the nails Pitting or small dents on the surface of your nails can be a sign of any of the following diseases: psoriasis, a long-term condition that tends to also cause red, flaky patches of skin (10%-50% of patients with psoriasis have pitted nails) eczema, a long-term skin condition reactive arthritis, where the immune system attacks the joints, muscles and other parts of the body following an infection alopecia areata, patches of hair loss that tend to come and go Grooves across the fingernails (Beau's lines) Deep lines or grooves that go from left to right across the nail are known as Beau's lines. They may be a sign of: a previous illness \u2013 the line forms at the time of the illness  chemotherapy a previous injury previous exposure to extremely cold temperatures, if you have Raynaud's disease Illness, injury or cold temperatures can interrupt nail growth and cause nail grooves to form at the base of the nails. These grooves tend to only be noticed a few months later, when the nails have grown and the grooves have moved up the nails to become visible. It takes about four to six months for a fingernail to fully grow out, and 6-12 months for a toenail. Unusually curved fingertips and nails Clubbing of the fingertips means the tissue beneath the nails thickens and the fingertips become rounded and bulbous. The fingernails curve over the rounded fingertips. Clubbing is thought to result from increased blood flow to the fingertips. It can run in families and be entirely harmless. However, if it suddenly develops, it may be a sign of one of many possible medical conditions, including: long-term lung disease or heart disease, such as lung cancer, bronchiectasis, or endocarditis inflammatory bowel disease, a long-term disease that causes inflammation of the lining of the gut stomach cancer or bowel cancer cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) polycythaemia, a condition where the blood is too thick  White lines running across nails White spots or streaks are normal and nothing to worry about, but parallel white lines that extend all the way across the nails, known as Muehrcke's lines, are a sign of low levels of protein in the blood. In contrast to Beau's lines (see above), they're not grooved. They can be due to liver disease or malnutrition. Dark stripes running down the nail If you have dark skin, it's fairly common to find dark stripes running down your nails (linear melanonychia). This occurs in more than 77% of black people over the age of 20, and in most cases is perfectly normal. However, it's not something to ignore: dark stripes may sometimes be a form of skin cancer that affects the nail bed, called subungual melanoma. It's important that your doctor checks it to rule out melanoma. Generally, subungual melanoma only affects one nail. Also, it will cause the stripe to change in appearance (for example, it may become wider or darker over time) and the pigmentation may also affect the surrounding skin (the nail fold). Red or brown little streaks under the nails If you have what look like red or brown little streaks underneath the nails, it's likely these are splinter haemorrhages \u2013 lines of blood caused by tiny damaged blood vessels. Just a few splinters under one nail are nothing to worry about and most likely due to injury of the nail. However, if many nails are affected, these splinters may be a sign of lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, an infection of the heart valves (endocarditis) or another underlying disease. A destroyed nail Nails can be destroyed by: injury, including nail biting skin diseases such as psoriasis or lichen planus overgrowth of the surrounding tissues, which is usually harmless (for example, due to a wart or verruca) but can sometimes be cancerous nail patella syndrome \u2013 an uncommon genetic condition which may cause missing nails, usually at birth  If one of your nails becomes destroyed and you don't remember injuring it, it's important to see your GP. Painful, red and swollen nail fold (paronychia) Paronychia is the name for inflammation of the nail fold, which is the skin and soft tissue that frames and supports the nail. This is most often caused by infection, injury or irritation. It's about three times more common in women than in men. Sometimes, there's an underlying skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis or another medical condition such as diabetes or HIV. Paronychia can be acute, where it develops over a few hours, or chronic, where it lasts more than six weeks. Acute paronychia Acute infective paronychia usually starts after a minor injury to the nail fold, such as from nail biting, picking or manicures. The affected area is red, warm, tender and swollen. After a while pus may be seen, which can form around the nail and may lift the nail. Acute paronychia is often caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, although any number of germs can be involved. Treatment is with antibiotic creams or tablets. If there's a large amount of pus, it can help to have this surgically drained. Sometimes, acute paronychia is caused by the cold sore virus, in which case it's known as herpetic whitlow. Acute paronychia can completely clear in a few days with treatment, but if it's not treated or doesn't respond to treatment, it can become long-term (chronic). Chronic paronychia Chronic paronychia may start more gradually and be more difficult to get rid of. It's most common in people who often have their hands in water or chemicals, such as cleaners, bartenders, canteen staff or fishmongers. It may start in one nail fold but can affect several fingers. The affected nail folds are swollen and may be red and sore from time to time, often after exposure to water. The nail plate gradually becomes thickened and ridged as it grows, and may become yellow or green and brittle. The skin in chronic paronychia is often colonised by a mixture of yeasts and bacteria. These germs thrive on previously damaged skin, without necessarily starting the skin damage in the first place. To settle chronic paronychia, both the skin damage and the colonisation with germs needs to be addressed. It can take months for chronic paronychia to clear, and after that up to a year for nails to grow back to normal. You may find that doing things such as keeping your hands dry and warm, frequently using emollient hand cream and avoiding biting and picking your nails can help.  See your GP if the condition is severe. Depending on the type of paronychia, creams and\/or tablets may be prescribed. Use these as directed. You may be referred to a dermatologist for further investigation of the underlying skin disease or for contact allergy testing, and for treatment advice.

Bone marrow is the spongy tissue found at the centre of some bones. It produces the body's blood cells. Multiple myeloma affects the plasma cells (a type of blood cell) inside the bone marrow. Myeloma does not usually take the form of a lump or tumour. Instead, the myeloma cells divide and expand within the bone marrow, damaging the bones and affecting the production of healthy blood cells. Myeloma often affects many places in the body, which is why it is called multiple myeloma. Commonly affected areas include the spine, skull, pelvis and ribs. Signs and symptoms In the early stages, myeloma may not cause any symptoms. It's often only suspected or diagnosed after a routine blood or urine test. However, myeloma will eventually cause a wide range of problems, including: a persistent dull ache or specific areas of tenderness in your bones weak bones that break (fracture) easily tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath (caused by anaemia) repeated infections less commonly, bruising and unusual bleeding \u2013 such as frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums and heavy periods Read more about the symptoms of multiple myeloma. When to see your GP See your GP if you have any of the above symptoms. While they're unlikely to be caused by cancer, it's best to get a proper diagnosis. Your GP will examine you to check for bone tenderness, bleeding, signs of infection, and any other symptoms that suggest you may have myeloma. They may also arrange blood and urine tests that can detect abnormal proteins produced by myeloma cells. If myeloma is suspected, you will be referred to a consultant haematologist (a specialist in blood conditions) for further tests and treatment. Read more about diagnosing multiple myeloma. Who is affected? Multiple myeloma is an uncommon type of cancer, with around 4,800 new cases diagnosed each year in the UK. It's not known exactly what causes the condition, although it's more common in: people with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) \u2013 an excess number of protein molecules called immunoglobulins in your blood men adults over 60 \u2013 most cases are diagnosed at around the age of 70, and cases affecting people under the age of 40 are rare black people \u2013 multiple myeloma is about twice as common in black populations compared with white and Asian populations Read more about the causes of multiple myeloma. How multiple myeloma is treated There is currently no cure for multiple myeloma, but treatment can often help control it for several years. Treatment will often involve: a combination of anti-myeloma medications to destroy the myeloma cells medicines and procedures to prevent and treat problems caused by myeloma, such as bone pain, fractures and anaemia anti-myeloma medicines to control the cancer when it comes back (relapses) As part of your treatment, you may be asked if you want to take part in a clinical trial to help researchers develop better treatments for multiple myeloma. Read more about treating multiple myeloma. Outlook The outlook for multiple myeloma is improving all the time, but the condition still can't be completely cured. Research is ongoing to try to find new and better treatments. As with other types of cancer, the outlook depends on things such as your age and general health. Some people may live less than a year, while others may live 20 years or more. Overall, about 77 in every 100 people will live at least a year, 47 in every 100 will live at least five years, and 33 in every 100 will live at least 10 years. Support groups If you've been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, you may find it useful to contact a local or national support group, such as Myeloma UK. Support groups can offer more information and advice. They can also often put you in touch with other people in a similar situation so you can share advice and talk about your experiences. The Myeloma UK website has more information about how they can help you and finding a local support group.

It's a lifelong condition that can sometimes cause serious disability, although it can occasionally be mild. In many cases, it\u2019s possible to treat symptoms. Average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with MS. It's estimated that there are more than 100,000 people diagnosed with MS in the UK. It's most commonly diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s, although it can develop at any age. It's about two to three times more common in women than men. Symptoms of MS The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person and can affect any part of the body. The main symptoms include: fatigue difficulty walking vision problems, such as blurred vision problems controlling the bladder numbness or tingling in different parts of the body muscle stiffness and spasms problems with balance and co-ordination problems with thinking, learning and planning Depending on the type of MS you have (see below), your symptoms may come and go in phases, or get steadily worse over time (progress). Read more about the symptoms of MS. Getting medical advice See your GP if you're worried you might have early signs of MS. The early symptoms often have many other causes, so they're not necessarily a sign of MS. Let your GP know about the specific pattern of symptoms you\u2019re experiencing. If you GP thinks you could have MS, you'll be referred to a neurologist (a specialist in conditions of the nervous system), who may suggest tests such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to check for features of MS. Read more about diagnosing MS. Types of MS MS starts in one of two general ways: with individual relapses (attacks or exacerbations) or with gradual progression. Relapsing-remitting MS More than 8 out of every 10 people with MS are diagnosed with the \"relapsing remitting\" type. Someone with relapsing remitting MS will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, known as \"relapses\". These typically worsen over a few days, last for days to weeks to months, then slowly improve over a similar time period. Relapses often occur without warning, but are sometimes associated with a period of illness or stress. The symptoms of a relapse may disappear altogether, with or without treatment, although some symptoms often persist, with repeated attacks happening over several years. Periods between attacks are known as periods of \"remission\". These can last for years at a time. After many years (usually decades), many, but not all people, with relapsing remitting MS go on to develop secondary progressive MS. In this type of MS, symptoms gradually worsen over time without obvious attacks. Some people continue to have infrequent relapses during this stage. Around half of people with relapsing remitting MS will develop secondary progressive MS within 15-20 years, and the risk of this happening increases the longer you have the condition. Primary progressive MS Just over 1 in 10 people with the condition start their MS with a gradual worsening of symptoms. In primary progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and accumulate over several years, and there are no periods of remission, though people often have periods where their condition appears to stabilise. What causes MS? MS is an autoimmune condition. This is when something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks a healthy part of the body \u2013 in this case, the brain or spinal cord of the nervous system. In MS, the immune system attacks the layer that surrounds and protects the nerves, called the myelin sheath. This damages and scars the sheath, and potentially the underlying nerves, meaning that messages travelling along the nerves become slowed or disrupted. Exactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is unclear, but most experts think a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved. Read more about the causes of MS. Treatments for MS There's currently no cure for MS, but a number of treatments can help control the condition. The treatment you need will depend on the specific symptoms and difficulties you have. It may include: treating relapses with short courses of steroid medication to speed up recovery specific treatments for individual MS symptoms treatment to reduce the number of relapses with medicines called disease-modifying therapies Disease-modifying therapies may also help to slow or reduce the overall worsening of disability of MS in people with relapsing remitting MS, and in people with secondary progressive MS who are still having relapses. Unfortunately, there's currently no treatment that can slow the progress of primary progressive MS or secondary progressive MS in the absence of relapses. Many therapies aiming to treat progressive MS are currently being researched. Read more about how MS is treated and living with MS. Outlook MS can be a challenging condition to live with, but new treatments over the past 20 years have considerably improved the quality of life of people with the condition. MS itself is rarely fatal, but complications may arise from severe MS, such as chest or bladder infections, or swallowing difficulties. The average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average, and this gap appears to be getting smaller all the time. MS charities and support groups There are two main MS charities in the UK: MS Society MS Trust These organisations offer useful advice, publications, news items about ongoing research, blogs and chatrooms. They can be very useful if you, or someone you know, has just been diagnosed with MS. There is also the shift.ms website which is an online community for younger people affected by MS.

It results in parts of the brain and spinal cord gradually becoming more damaged over time. It also causes a gradual loss of brain cells from the autonomic nervous system \u2013 the nervous system in charge of automatic functions we don't have to think about, like breathing and bladder control.  This results in a wide range of symptoms, including the muscle control problems seen in Parkinson's disease. What are the symptoms? Symptoms usually start between 50 and 60 years of age, but can start any time after 30. Many different functions of the body can be affected, including the urinary system, blood pressure control and muscle movement. The range of symptoms is described below, although it is important to note that a person with multiple system atrophy won't necessarily develop all of these. Bladder problems Men and women with multiple system atrophy will usually have one or more of the following bladder symptoms: constantly feeling the need to urinate urinating more frequently passing urine unintentionally \u2013 read more about urinary incontinence not being able to empty the bladder properly  not being able to urinate  Erection problems Men with multiple system atrophy will usually experience erectile dysfunction (the inability to get and maintain an erection), although this is a common problem that many men without the disease develop. Low blood pressure when standing up  It's common for someone with multiple system atrophy to feel lightheaded, dizzy and faint when they suddenly sit or stand up. This is because their blood pressure drops when they become upright, which is known as postural hypotension. When you stand up after lying down, your blood vessels usually narrow quickly and your heart rate increases slightly, to prevent blood pressure dropping and maintain blood flow to the brain. This function is carried out automatically by the autonomic nervous system. However, because this doesn't work properly in people with multiple system atrophy, this control is lost. Problems with coordination, balance and speech A part of the brain called the cerebellum becomes damaged in multiple system atrophy, which can make the person clumsy and unsteady when walking, and can also cause slurred speech. These problems are collectively known as cerebellar ataxia. Feeling stiff, and slowness of movement  A person with multiple system atrophy typically has much slower movements than normal. This is referred to as \"bradykinesia\" and can make everyday tasks difficult. Movement is hard to initiate, and they often have a distinctive slow, shuffling walk with very small steps.  Some people may also have stiffness and tension in the muscles, which can make it even more difficult to move around and can result in painful muscle cramps (dystonia). The above symptoms are typical of Parkinson's disease, but unfortunately the medication used to relieve these symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease (levodopa therapy) is not very effective for people with multiple system atrophy. Other signs and symptoms People with multiple system atrophy may also have: shoulder and neck pain constipation cold hands and feet problems controlling sweating muscle weakness in the body and limbs \u2013 it may be more pronounced in one arm or leg uncontrollable laughing or crying  sleep problems \u2013 insomnia, snoring, restless legs, nightmares noisy breathing and unintentional sighing a weak, quiet voice swallowing problems blurred vision depression dementia (although this is uncommon) What's the cause? The cause of multiple system atrophy is not well understood. It doesn\u2019t appear to be inherited \u2013 there's no evidence that an affected person's children will develop it. However, it's possible that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the disease, so scientists are currently researching whether there is a genetic tendency (predisposition) to develop it. The brain cells of a person with multiple system atrophy contain misfolded alpha-synuclein protein (of which there is lots of in the brain). It's thought that a build-up of abnormal alpha-synuclein is responsible for the loss of brain cells. How common is multiple system atrophy? Multiple system atrophy is estimated to affect around 5 in every 100,000 people worldwide. There are almost 3,000 people in the UK living with the disease. How is it diagnosed? There is no specific test to diagnose multiple system atrophy. A diagnosis can usually be made based on the symptoms, although it can potentially be confused with Parkinson's disease. The box on this page explains how multiple system atrophy is different to Parkinson's disease. If a doctor (usually a neurologist) suspects multiple system atrophy from a patient's symptoms, they will test the patient's reflexes and \"automatic\" body functions, such as bladder function. These body functions and responses may be altered in someone with multiple system atrophy. A brain scan is often needed \u2013 usually an MRI scan or a SPECT scan (read NHS information on SPECT scans) \u2013 to detect any loss of brain cells. More detailed assessments of autonomic function may also be performed \u2013 for example, recording blood pressure changes when lying and standing. How is it treated? Unfortunately, there is no cure for multiple system atrophy and no way of slowing the disease's progression.  People with multiple system atrophy typically live for six to nine years after symptoms start, and may deteriorate quickly during this time. However, some people may live for more than 10 years after a diagnosis. Help and support is available, and symptoms can be managed so the patient is as independent and comfortable as possible. Read about the: treatment of low blood pressure  treatment of constipation  treatment of urinary incontinence  treatment of swallowing problems Support from physiotherapists and occupational therapists can help people with multiple system atrophy to safely keep active, in order to maintain fitness and muscle strength. Support for carers If you're a carer of someone with multiple system atrophy, it's important to remember that you're not alone and that there is support available. By law, you're entitled to a free health and social care assessment, which you can access through your local authority. The assessment will look at the possibility of you getting practical and financial help. Find out more about social care assessments. Being a carer means that you may be entitled to certain financial benefits, especially if you have to give up work. Find out more about carers' benefits. Carers can also get help with breaks from caring from local authorities or organisations such as Carers Trust. Find out about getting time off from caring. Support for patients If you have been diagnosed with multiple system atrophy, your treatment and medical care will probably be the first thing on your mind. However, there are other aspects of your life to consider, and it's important to know exactly what kind of assistance is available and where you can get it. If you are finding it hard to cope with day-to-day life, talk about your needs with your doctor or nurse, who will refer you to a social worker. Your social worker will assess exactly the kind of help you need: Care attendants can help with housework, dressing and washing, or even just keep you company and give your carer a break. Look into this as soon as you can, as many care attendants have waiting lists. Carers Trust is an organisation that helps carers in the UK by providing access to breaks, information and advice, education, training and employment opportunities. Visit the Carers Trust website at http:\/\/www.carers.org\/ (links to external site), or phone 0844 800 4361. Meals on wheels. Contact your local council about its meals on wheels service. It may be able to offer financial assistance to help pay for this. Go to GOV.UK for details of your eligibility. Benefits \u2013 You may be eligible for Income Support, Disability Living Allowance (DLA) or Attendance Allowance. Get in touch with the Benefit Enquiry Line for more details on 0800 882200 (textphone 0800 243355) or online at www.dwp.gov.uk (links to external site). Home adaptations \u2013 Occupational therapists provide a detailed assessment of your needs at home, making life easier by arranging equipment and making adaptations to your home. The aim is to create a comfortable and practical place to live during your treatment. This could mean anything from adding handrails around the house to installing a downstairs shower.   Information about you If you have multiple system atrophy, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. More information and support Multiple System Atrophy Trust \u2013 The Multiple System Atrophy Trust is the UK's main charity supporting people with the disease, as well as their families, carers and the health professionals treating them. It provides specialist nurses, an email and telephone support service, and runs a UK-wide support group network. It also funds vital research that aims to find the cause and a cure for multiple system atrophy.

It\u2019s most recognisable by the painful swellings at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), giving a person with mumps a distinctive \"hamster face\" appearance. Other symptoms of mumps include headaches, joint pain and a high temperature, which may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands. When to see your GP It's important to contact your GP if you suspect mumps so a diagnosis can be made. While mumps isn't usually serious, the condition has similar symptoms to more serious types of infection, such as glandular fever and tonsillitis. Your GP can usually make a diagnosis after seeing and feeling the swelling, looking at the position of the tonsils in the mouth and checking the person's temperature to see if it's higher than normal. Let your GP know in advance if you're coming to the surgery, so they can take any necessary precautions to prevent the spread of infection. If your GP suspects mumps, they should notify your local health protection unit (HPU). The HPU will arrange for a sample of saliva to be tested to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. How mumps is spread Mumps is spread in the same way as colds and flu \u2013 through infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and transferred into the mouth or nose.   A person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards. During this time, it's important to prevent the infection spreading to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who haven't been vaccinated. If you have mumps, you can help prevent it spreading by: regularly washing your hands with soap using and disposing of tissues when you sneeze avoiding school or work for at least five days after your symptoms first develop Preventing mumps You can protect your child against mumps by making sure they're given the combined MMR vaccine (for mumps, measles and rubella). The MMR vaccine is part of the routine NHS childhood immunisation schedule. Your child should be given one dose when they are around 12-13 months and a second booster dose before they start school. Once both doses are given, the vaccine provides 95% protection against mumps. Treatment for mumps There's currently no cure for mumps, but the infection should pass within one or two weeks. Treatment is used to relieve symptoms and includes: getting plenty of bed rest and fluids using painkillers, such as ibuprofen and paracetamol \u2013 aspirin shouldn't be given to children under 16 applying a warm or cool compress to the swollen glands to help relieve pain Read more about treating mumps. Complications Mumps usually passes without causing serious damage to a person's health. Serious complications are rare. However, mumps can lead to viral meningitis if the virus moves into the outer layer of the brain. Other complications include swelling of the testicles in males or the ovaries in females (if the affected male or female has gone through puberty). Read more about the complications of mumps. Who is affected Most cases of mumps occur in young adults (usually born between 1980 and 1990) who didn\u2019t receive the MMR vaccine as part of their childhood vaccination schedule or didn't have mumps as a child. There were 2,224 confirmed cases of mumps in England and Wales during 2014.

Their main intention is to assume the \"sick role\" to have people care for them and be the centre of attention. Any practical benefit in pretending to be sick \u2013 for example, claiming incapacity benefit \u2013 isn't the reason for their behaviour. Munchausen's syndrome is named after a German aristocrat, Baron Munchausen, who became famous for telling wild, unbelievable tales about his exploits. Types of behaviour People with Munchausen's syndrome can behave in a number of different ways, including: pretending to have psychological symptoms \u2013 for example, claiming to hear voices or claiming to see things that aren't really there pretending to have physical symptoms \u2013 for example, claiming to have chest pain or a stomach ache actively trying to get ill \u2013 such as deliberately infecting a wound by rubbing dirt into it Some people with Munchausen's syndrome may spend years travelling from hospital to hospital feigning a wide range of illnesses. When it's discovered they're lying, they may suddenly leave hospital and move to another area. People with Munchausen's syndrome can be very manipulative and, in the most serious cases, may undergo painful and sometimes life-threatening surgery, even though they know it's unnecessary. Read more about the signs and symptoms of Munchausen's syndrome. What causes Munchausen's syndrome? Munchausen's syndrome is complex and poorly understood. Many people refuse psychiatric treatment or psychological profiling, and it's unclear why people with the syndrome behave in the way they do. Based on the available research and case studies, several factors have been identified as possible causes of Munchausen's syndrome. These include: emotional trauma or illness during childhood \u2013 this often resulted in extensive medical attention a personality disorder \u2013 a mental health condition that causes patterns of abnormal thinking and behaviour a grudge against authority figures or healthcare professionals Childhood trauma Munchausen's syndrome may be caused by parental neglect and abandonment, or other childhood trauma. As a result of this trauma, a person may have unresolved issues with their parents that cause them to fake illness. They may do this because they: have a compulsion to punish themselves (masochism) by making themselves ill because they feel unworthy need to feel important and be the centre of attention need to pass responsibility for their wellbeing and care on to other people There's also some evidence to suggest people who've had extensive medical procedures, or received prolonged medical attention during childhood or adolescence, are more likely to develop Munchausen's syndrome when they're older. This may be because they associate their childhood memories with a sense of being cared for. As they get older, they try to obtain the same feelings of reassurance by pretending to be ill. Personality disorders Some examples of the different personality disorders thought to be linked with Munchausen's syndrome include: antisocial personality disorder \u2013 a person may take pleasure in manipulating and deceiving doctors, giving them a sense of power and control borderline personality disorder \u2013 where a person struggles to control their feelings and often swings between positive and negative views of others narcissistic personality disorder \u2013 where a person often swings between seeing themselves as special and fearing they're worthless It could be that the person has an unstable sense of their own identity and also has difficulties establishing meaningful relationships with others. Playing the \"sick role\" allows them to adopt an identity that brings unconditional support and acceptance from others with it. Admission to hospital also gives the person a clearly defined place in a social network. Diagnosing Munchausen's syndrome Diagnosing Munchausen's syndrome can be challenging for medical professionals. People with the syndrome are often very convincing and skilled at manipulating and exploiting a doctor's concern for their patients, and their natural interest in investigating unusual medical conditions. Investigating claims If a healthcare professional suspects a person may have Munchausen's syndrome, they'll look at the person's health records to check for inconsistencies between their claimed and actual medical history. They may also contact the person's family and friends to find out whether their claims about their past are true. Healthcare professionals can also run tests to check for evidence of self-inflicted illness or tampering with clinical tests. For example, the person's blood can be checked for traces of medication they shouldn't be taking but which could explain their symptoms. Doctors will also want to rule out other possible motivations for their behaviour, such as faking illness for financial gain or because they want access to strong painkillers. Munchausen's syndrome can usually be confidently diagnosed if: there's clear evidence of fabricating or inducing symptoms the person's prime motivation is to be seen as sick there's no other likely reason or explanation for their behaviour Treating Munchausen's syndrome Treating Munchausen's syndrome can be difficult because most people refuse to admit they have a problem and won't co-operate with suggested treatment plans. Some experts recommend that healthcare professionals should adopt a gentle non-confrontational approach, suggesting the person has complex health needs and may benefit from a referral to a psychiatrist. Others argue that a person with Munchausen's syndrome should be confronted directly and asked why they've lied and whether they have stress and anxiety. One of the biggest ironies about Munchausen's syndrome is that people who have it are genuinely mentally ill, but will often only admit to having a physical illness. If a person admits to their behaviour, they can be referred to specialist psychiatric services for further treatment. If they don't admit to lying, most experts agree the doctor in charge of their care should minimise medical contact with them. This is because the doctor-patient relationship is based on trust and if there's evidence the patient can no longer be trusted, the doctor is unable to continue treating them. Psychiatric treatment and CBT It may be possible to help control the symptoms of Munchausen's syndrome if the person admits they have a problem and co-operates with treatment. There's no standard treatment for Munchausen's syndrome, but a combination of psychoanalysis and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has shown some success in helping people control their symptoms. Psychoanalysis is a type of psychotherapy which attempts to uncover and resolve these unconscious beliefs and motivations which can cause many psychological conditions. CBT helps a person identify unhelpful and unrealistic beliefs and behavioural patterns. A specially trained therapist teaches the person ways of replacing unrealistic beliefs with more realistic and balanced ones. Family therapy People with Munchausen's syndrome still in close contact with their family may also benefit from having family therapy. The person with the syndrome and their close family members discuss how it's affected the family and the positive changes that can be made. It can also teach family members how to avoid reinforcing the person's abnormal behaviour. For example, this could involve recognising when the person is playing the \"sick role\" and avoiding showing them concern or offering support. Who's affected? From the available case studies, there appear to be two relatively distinct groups of people affected by Munchausen's syndrome. They are: women who are 20 to 40 years of age, often with a background in healthcare, such as working as a nurse or medical technician unmarried white men who are 30 to 50 years of age  It's unclear why these two groups tend to be affected by Munchausen's syndrome. It's also not known how common the syndrome is. Some experts believe Munchausen's syndrome is underdiagnosed because many people succeed in deceiving medical staff. It's also possible cases may be overdiagnosed as the same person could use different identities. A large study carried out in a Canadian hospital estimated that out of 1,300 patients, there were 10 who were faking symptoms of illness. Fabricated or induced illness Fabricated or induced illness, also known as Munchausen's by proxy, is a variant of Munchausen's syndrome. This is where a person fabricates or induces illness in a person under their care. Most cases involve a mother and her child.

It occurs when a parent or carer, usually the child\u2019s biological mother, exaggerates or deliberately causes symptoms of illness in the child. FII is also known as Munchausen's syndrome by proxy. Munchausen's syndrome, also known as factitious disorder, is a condition where a person pretends to be ill or causes illness or injury to themselves. However, healthcare professionals in the UK prefer to use the term fabricated or induced illness, or factitious disorder imposed on another. This is because the term Munchausen's syndrome by proxy places the emphasis on the person carrying out the abuse, rather than the victim. The term Munchausen's syndrome by proxy is still widely used in other countries. Behaviours in FII The term FII covers a wide range of cases and behaviours involving parents seeking healthcare for a child. This ranges from extreme neglect (failing to seek medical care) to induced illness. Behaviours in FII include: a mother or other carer who convinces their child they are ill when they are perfectly healthy a mother or other carer who exaggerates or lies about their child\u2019s symptoms a mother or other carer who manipulates test results to suggest the presence of illness \u2013 for example, by putting glucose in urine samples to suggest the child has diabetes a mother or other carer who deliberately induces symptoms of illness \u2013 for example, by poisoning her child with unnecessary medication or other substances Learn more about the signs of fabricated or induced illness. How common is fabricated or induced illness? It's difficult to estimate how widespread FII is, because many cases may go unreported or undetected. In an average population of one million people, around one child per year would be affected. The British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU), which is a specialist unit that assists research into rare childhood conditions, carried out a study of FII cases. It identified 97 cases of FII in the UK over a two-year period. However, it's likely that this figure underestimates the true prevalence of FII. FII can involve children of all ages, but the most severe cases usually involve children under five. In over 90% of reported cases of FII, the child\u2019s mother is responsible for the abuse. However, cases have been reported in which the father, foster parent, grandparent, guardian, or a healthcare or childcare professional was responsible. Motivation It's not fully understood why FII occurs. In cases where the mother is responsible, it could be that the mother enjoys the attention of playing the role of a \"caring mother\". A large number of mothers involved in cases of FII had a previous history of unresolved psychological and behavioural problems, such as a history of self-harming, or drug or alcohol misuse, or have experienced the death of another child. A high proportion of mothers involved in FII have been found to have so-called \"somatoform disorders\", where they experience multiple, recurrent physical symptoms. A proportion of these mothers also have Munchausen's syndrome. A high proportion of mothers also have a type of mental health problem called borderline personality disorder, which is characterised by emotional instability, impulsiveness and disturbed thinking. There have been several reported cases where illness was fabricated or induced for financial reasons \u2013 for example, to claim disability benefits. Read more about the possible causes of fabricated or induced illness. Child protection FII is a child protection issue and cannot be treated by the NHS alone. Medical professionals who suspect FII is taking place should liaise with social services and the police, and must follow local child protection procedures. If your job involves working with children \u2013 for example, if you are a nursery worker or teacher, you should inform the person in your organisation who is responsible for child protection issues. If you don't know who this is, your immediate supervisor or manager should be able to tell you. If you suspect that someone you know may be fabricating or inducing illness in their child, it's not recommended that you confront them directly. A direct confrontation is unlikely to make a person admit to wrongdoing, and it may give them the opportunity to dispose of any evidence of abuse. You can contact your local social services department or telephone the NSPCC\u2019s child protection helpline, which is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, on 0808 800 5000. Read more about diagnosing fabricated or induced illness. Treatment The child The first priority is to protect the child and restore them to good health. This may involve removing the child from the care of the person responsible. If the child is in hospital, it may involve removing the responsible parent or carer from the ward. They may need help returning to a normal lifestyle, including going back to school. Younger children and babies who don't understand they were victims of abuse often make a good recovery once the abuse stops. Older children, particularly those who have been abused for many years, will have more complex problems. For example, many older affected children believe they are really ill. They need help and support to develop a more realistic understanding of their health. They may also need to learn how to tell the difference between the lies of their parent or carer and reality. It's also common for older children to feel loyal to their parent or carer, and a sense of guilt if that parent or carer is removed from the family. The parent or carer Once the child is safe, it may be possible to treat the parent or carer's underlying psychological problems. This may include a combination of: intensive psychotherapy family therapy \u2013 the father may need individual help, especially if he is the main caregiver The aim of psychotherapy is to uncover and resolve the issues that caused them to fake or induce illness in their child. The aim of family therapy is to resolve any tensions within the family, improve parenting skills and attempt to repair the relationship between the parent or carer and the child. In more severe cases, the parent or carer may be compulsorily detained in a psychiatric ward under the Mental Health Act so their relationship with their child can be closely monitored. Parents or carers involved in FII are difficult to treat, because most do not admit their deceptions and refuse to admit their abusive behaviour. Therefore, in many cases, the child is permanently removed from their care. The best results occur in cases where the parent or carer: understands and acknowledges the harm they have caused is able to communicate the underlying motivations and needs that led them to fake or cause illness is able to work together with healthcare and other professionals Outlook Children affected by FII can experience long-term consequences in terms of their physical health, as well as significant psychological and emotional trauma. A BPSU study found that one in four victims of FII still had significant physical and\/or psychological problems two years after the abuse had stopped. In cases involving administering unnecessary medicines or other substances, it's estimated that around 1 in 16 will die as a result of this abuse. A further 1 in 14 will experience long-term or permanent injury. Munchausen\u2019s syndrome Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

Media last reviewed: 20\/05\/2016 Next review due: 20\/05\/2018 Media controversy There has been some controversy in the media regarding FII, with some commentators suggesting that it's not a real phenomenon. However, there's a great deal of evidence to suggest the condition does exist.

MD is a progressive condition, which means it gets worse over time. It often begins by affecting a particular group of muscles, before affecting the muscles more widely. Some types of MD eventually affect the heart or the muscles used for breathing, at which point the condition becomes life-threatening. There's no cure for MD, but treatment can help to manage many of the symptoms. What causes muscular dystrophy? MD is caused by changes (mutations) in the genes responsible for the structure and functioning of a person's muscles. The mutations cause changes in the muscle fibres that interfere with the muscles' ability to function. Over time, this causes increasing disability. The mutations are often inherited from a person's parents. If you have a family history of MD, your GP may refer you for genetic testing and counselling to evaluate your risk of developing the condition or having a child with MD, and to discuss the options available to you. Read more about the causes of MD and genetic testing for MD. Types of muscular dystrophy There are many different types of MD, each with somewhat different symptoms. Not all types cause severe disability and many don't affect life expectancy. Some of the more common types of MD include: Duchenne MD \u2013 one of the most common and severe forms, it usually affects boys in early childhood; men with the condition will usually only live into their 20s or 30s myotonic dystrophy \u2013 a type of MD that can develop at any age; life expectancy isn't always affected, but people with a severe form of myotonic dystrophy may have shortened lives facioscapulohumeral MD \u2013 a type of MD that can develop in childhood or adulthood; it progresses slowly and isn't usually life-threatening Becker MD \u2013 closely related to Duchenne MD, but it develops later in childhood and is less severe; life expectancy isn't usually affected as much limb-girdle MD \u2013 a group of conditions that usually develop in late childhood or early adulthood; some variants can progress quickly and be life-threatening, whereas others develop slowly oculopharyngeal MD \u2013 a type of MD that doesn't usually develop until a person is 50-60 years old, and doesn't tend to affect life expectancy Emery-Dreifuss MD \u2013 a type of MD that develops in childhood or early adulthood; most people with this condition will live until at least middle-age Read more about the types of MD and diagnosing MD. Who's affected by muscular dystrophy? In the UK, more than 70,000 people have MD or a related condition. Duchenne MD is the most common type of MD. In the UK, about 100 boys are born with Duchenne MD each year, and there are about 2,500 boys living with the condition in the UK at any one time. Myotonic MD is the second most common type of MD, affecting around one person in every 8,000.  Facioscapulohumeral MD is thought to affect around one in every 20,000 people in the UK, making it the third most common MD. Diagnosing muscular dystrophy Many different methods can be used to diagnose the various types of MD. The age at which the condition is diagnosed will vary, depending on when symptoms first start to appear. Diagnosis will involve some or all of the following stages: investigating any symptoms discussing any family history of MD physical examination blood tests electrical tests on the nerves and muscles a muscle biopsy (where a small tissue sample is removed for testing) Visit your GP if you or your child has any symptoms of MD. If necessary, your GP may refer you to a hospital for further tests. Treating muscular dystrophy There's no cure for MD, but a range of treatments can help with the physical disabilities and problems that may develop. These can include: mobility assistance \u2013 including exercise, physiotherapy and physical aids support groups \u2013 to deal with the practical and emotional impact of MD surgery \u2013 to correct postural deformities, such as scoliosis  medication \u2013 such as steroids to improve muscle strength, or ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers to treat heart problems New research is looking into ways of repairing the genetic mutations and damaged muscles associated with MD. There are currently promising clinical trials for Duchenne MD. Read more about treating MD. Information about you If you have MD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Support groups MD can affect you emotionally, as well as physically. Support groups and organisations may help you understand and come to terms with your condition. They can also provide useful advice and support for those who care for people with MD. There are several national charities that offer support for people affected by MD, such as the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign. You can also ask your GP or other healthcare professionals treating you about local support groups. There are also some national support groups that promote research or provide support for specific types of MD, such as Action Duchenne and the Myotonic Dystrophy Support Group.

However, they're able to speak freely to close family and friends when nobody else is listening \u2013 for example, when they're at home.  It's important to understand that when the mutism happens, the child is not voluntarily refusing to speak but is literally unable to speak, feeling frozen. In time, they learn to anticipate the situations that provoke mutism and do all they can to avoid them. Experts believe SM is a phobia of talking.  Most children will work their way through SM with sympathetic support, although they may remain reserved and anxious in social situations. This page covers the following information and advice for professionals and parents of children with SM: Which children are affected?  When does it start?  What are the signs?  What causes selective mutism?  What can parents do?  How is it treated?  Where can I get support and advice?   Which children are affected?  SM is relatively rare, affecting one in 150 children. Most primary schools will know of at least one child with SM. It's more common in girls and children of ethnic minority populations, or in those who have recently migrated from their country of birth. When does it start?  SM usually occurs in early childhood and is first noticed when the child begins to interact outside the family circle \u2013 for example, when they start nursery or school. It can last a few months but, if left untreated, can continue into adulthood. What are the signs?  Children with SM often have other fears and social anxieties and may have additional speech and language difficulties. They may not be able to give you eye contact and may seem: nervous uneasy and socially awkward clingy excessively shy and withdrawn, dreading that they will be expected to speak  serious stubborn or aggressive, having temper tantrums when they get home from school  frozen and expressionless during periods they cannot talk Children with SM may communicate using gestures \u2013 for example, nodding or shaking their head to get their message across. They may manage to respond with a word or two, or speak in an altered voice, such as a whisper. Some children with SM also have a fear of using public toilets \u2013 perhaps because they fear making sounds while urinating that others may hear. What causes selective mutism?  It's not always clear what causes some children to develop SM, although it is known to be associated with anxiety. The child will usually have inherited a tendency to experience anxiety from a family member. Many children become very distressed when separated from their parents and transfer this anxiety to the adults who try to settle them into a new setting. If they have a speech and language disorder or hearing problem, this only makes speaking even more stressful. Some children have trouble processing sensory information such as loud noise and jostling from crowds \u2013 a condition known as sensory integration dysfunction. This can make them \"shut down\" and unable to speak when overwhelmed in a busy environment. There is no evidence to suggest that children with SM are more likely to have suffered abuse, neglect or trauma than any other child. When mutism occurs as a symptom of post-traumatic stress it follows a very different pattern and the child suddenly stops talking in environments where they previously had no difficulty. However, this type of speech withdrawal may lead to SM if the triggers are not addressed and the child develops a more general anxiety about communication. Another common misconception is that a selectively mute child is controlling or manipulative, or that the child has autism. There is no relationship between SM and autism, although the two conditions can occur in the same child. What can parents do?  If left untreated, SM can lead to isolation, low self-esteem and social anxiety disorder. It can persist into adolescence and even adulthood if not tackled. With diagnosis at a young age and appropriate management, children can successfully overcome this disorder. SM needs to be recognised early by families and schools so that they can work together to reduce the child\u2019s anxiety. Staff in early years settings and schools are increasingly seeking training so they are ready to provide appropriate support. Getting a diagnosis If you suspect your child has SM and help is not available, or if there are additional concerns \u2013 for example if your child struggles to understand instructions or follow routines \u2013 seek a formal diagnosis from a qualified speech and language therapist. Approach your nearest speech and language therapy clinic or speak to your health visitor or GP, who can refer you. Do not accept the assurance that your child will grow out of it. Older children may also need to see a mental health professional or school educational psychologist. The clinician may initially wish to talk to you without your child present, so you can speak freely about any anxieties you have about your child\u2019s development or behaviour. The clinician will want to find out if anxiety disorders are present in your family, and if there is anything in your child's life causing them significant distress, such as divorce or difficulty learning a second language. They will look at your child's behavioural characteristics and take their full medical history. Your child may not be able to speak during their assessment, but the clinician will be prepared for this and try to find another medium of communication. For example, children may be encouraged to communicate through parents, or older children may be invited to write down responses or use a computer.  SM must be diagnosed according to specific guidelines. These include observations that: your child does not speak in specific situations, such as school lessons or when they can be overheard in public your child can speak normally in situations in which they feel comfortable, such as being alone with you at home or in an empty classroom  their inability to speak interferes with their ability to function in that setting their inability to speak has lasted for at least two months their inability to speak is not better explained by another behavioural, mental or communication disorder How is it treated?  The effectiveness of treatment depends on: how long your child has had selective mutism whether or not they have additional communication or learning difficulties or anxieties the co-operation of everyone involved with the child  With appropriate handling and treatment, most children overcome selective mutism \u2013 but the older they are, the longer it takes. They should gradually progress from relaxing in their school or nursery, to saying single words and sentences to one person, before eventually being able to speak freely to all people in all settings. Treatment does not focus on the speaking itself, but focuses on reducing the anxiety that your child has for speaking to and being overheard by people outside their immediate circle of family and friends. The need for individual treatment can be avoided if family and staff in early years settings work together to reduce this anxiety by creating a positive environment for the child. This means: not letting the child know you are anxious reassuring them that they'll be able to speak when they're ready concentrating on having fun praising all efforts the child makes to join in and interact with others (such as passing and taking toys, nodding, pointing) showing no surprise when the child speaks, but responding warmly as you would to any other child As well as these environmental changes, older children may need individual support to overcome their anxiety. The most effective forms of treatment are behavioural therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy. These are briefly described below, along with some commonly used techniques to help your child overcome their anxiety.  Behavioural therapy Behavioural therapy is designed to reinforce desired behaviours and eliminate undesired behaviours.  Rather than examining your child\u2019s past or their thoughts, it concentrates on helping your child combat their difficulty in a practical way, using a step-by-step approach to help them conquer their fears. Several of the following techniques can be used at the same time by family members and school staff under the guidance of a speech and language therapist or psychologist: Stimulus fading \u2013 the child communicates at ease with someone such as their parent when nobody else is present. Gradually, another person is introduced into the situation and once they are included in talking, the parent can withdraw. The new person can introduce more people in the same way. Positive and negative reinforcement \u2013 being positive about all forms of communication and not rewarding avoidance and silence. If the child is under pressure to talk, they will experience great relief when the moment passes. This not only makes being silent far more enjoyable than trying to speak, but also strengthens the child\u2019s belief that talking is a negative experience. Desensitisation \u2013 reducing the child\u2019s sensitivity to the sound of their voice in public, and encouraging them to communicate using voice or video recordings. Older children may build contacts using email, instant messaging or online chat, and then leave voicemail messages. They can build up relationships this way until they feel ready to try more direct communication. Shaping \u2013 a technique that encourages the child to interact without speaking before being slowly coaxed into trying sounds such as clicks and hums, then whispering quiet sounds such as \u2018s\u2019, and gradually trying a word or two. Graded exposure \u2013 an older child is encouraged to work out how much anxiety different situations cause (such as answering the phone or asking a stranger the time). Situations causing the least anxiety are tackled first. With realistic targets and repeated exposure, the anxiety associated with these situations decreases to a manageable level. Cognitive behavioural therapy Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) works by helping individuals focus on how they think about themselves, the world and other people and how their perception of these things affects their thoughts and feelings. This is carried out by mental health professionals and is more appropriate for older children and adolescents, particularly those experiencing social anxiety disorder, and adults who have grown up with SM. CBT also challenges fears and preconceptions through graded exposure. Read more about CBT. Medication Medication is only really appropriate for older children and teenagers whose anxiety has led to depression and other problems. Medication should never be prescribed as an alternative to the environmental changes and behavioural approaches described above. However, antidepressants may be prescribed alongside a treatment programme to decrease anxiety levels and speed the process of therapy, especially if previous attempts to engage the child in treatment have failed. Where can I get support and advice?  The Selective Mutism Information and Research Association provides more information on SM, including training days for parents and professionals, and can put you in contact with other affected families. In addition to your nearest speech and language therapy clinic, the Association of Speech and Language Therapists in Independent Practice can put you in contact with treating professionals. Finding a professional with specialist knowledge SM has been poorly understood over the years. It is only relatively recently the medical view that children were refusing to speak has changed, and effective treatment approaches have been developed. There is a growing body of expertise among health professionals, educational psychologists and teaching staff, but parents need to be prepared for the fact that professionals in their area may not have up-to-date knowledge or experience of working with SM. If this is the case, parents should seek out teachers and health professionals who are willing to listen, learn and develop their specialist knowledge to provide appropriate support. Advice for parents Don't use pressure or bribes with a child to encourage speaking. Let your child know you understand they are scared to speak and have difficulty speaking at times. Don't praise your child publicly for speaking, as this can cause embarrassment. Wait until you are alone with them and consider a special treat for their achievement. Reassure your child that nonverbal communication (such as smiling and waving) is fine until they feel better about talking. Don't avoid parties or family visits, but consider what environmental changes are necessary to make the situation more comfortable for the child. Ask friends and relatives to give your child time to warm up at his or her own pace and to focus on fun activities rather than getting them to talk. Give them love, support and patience as well as verbal encouragement.

There's some debate over the correct term to use for the condition, but these pages will refer to the condition as CFS. CFS is a serious condition that can cause long-term illness and disability, but many people \u2013 particularly children and young people \u2013 improve over time. Who is affected? It's estimated around 250,000 people in the UK have CFS. Anyone can get the condition, although it's more common in women than men. It usually develops when people are in their early 20s to mid-40s. Children can also be affected, usually between the ages of 13 and 15.  How it affects quality of life Most cases of CFS are mild or moderate, but up to one in four people with CFS have severe symptoms.

Why it happens It's not known exactly what causes CFS. Various theories have been suggested, including: a viral or bacterial infection problems with the immune system an imbalance of hormones psychiatric problems, such as stress and emotional trauma Some people are thought to be more susceptible to the condition because of their genes, as the condition is more common in some families. More research is needed to confirm exactly what causes the condition. Read more about the causes of CFS. How it is diagnosed There are specific guidelines issued by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) about the diagnosis and management of CFS. NICE says a diagnosis of CFS should be considered if you meet specific criteria regarding your fatigue \u2013 for example, it can't be explained by other conditions \u2013 and if you also have other symptoms, such as sleeping problems or problems thinking and concentrating. The diagnosis can then be confirmed if these symptoms are experienced for several months. Read more about diagnosing CFS. How it is treated Treatment for CFS may be able to reduce the symptoms. Everyone with CFS responds to treatment differently, so your treatment plan will be tailored to you. Some of the main treatments include: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) a structured exercise programme called graded exercise therapy medication to control pain, nausea and sleeping problems Most people with CFS improve over time, although some people don't make a full recovery. It's also likely there will be periods when symptoms get better or worse. Children and young people with CFS are more likely to recover fully. Read more about treating CFS. Different terms for the condition chronic fatigue syndrome \u2013 often used and preferred by doctors as there's little evidence of brain and spinal cord inflammation, which the term ME suggests; ME is also thought to be too specific to cover all the symptoms of the condition myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) \u2013 preferred by those who feel CFS is not specific enough and doesn't reflect the severity and different types of fatigue, and implies that fatigue is the only symptom (myalgic encephalopathy is sometimes also used) systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID) \u2013 a new term suggested in a 2015 report by the US Institute of Medicine, which implies that the condition affects many systems in the body (systemic); the word \"disease\" highlights the serious nature of the condition in some people Page last reviewed: 25\/02\/2015 Next review due: 25\/02\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It mainly affects muscles that are controlled voluntarily \u2013 often those controlling eye and eyelid movement, facial expression, chewing, swallowing and speaking. Sometimes, the muscles that control breathing, neck and limb movements are also affected.  The muscle weakness associated with myasthenia gravis is usually worse during, or just after, physical activity and improves with rest. The symptoms are often described as being at their worst when a person is tired, for example, at the end of the day. Read more about the symptoms of myasthenia gravis. What causes myasthenia gravis? Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune condition that affects the nerves and muscles. Autoimmune conditions are caused by the body's immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue. In myasthenia gravis, the immune system produces antibodies (proteins) that block or damage muscle receptor cells. This prevents messages being passed from the nerve endings to the muscles, which results in the muscles not contracting (tightening) and becoming weak. It's not fully understood why some people's immune systems produce specific antibodies that block the nerve's signal to the muscle. Read more about the causes of myasthenia gravis. Diagnosing myasthenia gravis The process of diagnosing myasthenia gravis can take a long time because muscle weakness is a common symptom of many different conditions. Your GP will look at your medical history and symptoms. They may suspect myasthenia gravis if your eye movements are impaired or if you have muscle weakness but you're still able to feel things. Around half of people with myasthenia gravis initially develop symptoms of double vision or eyelid droop, with more than 90% of people developing these symptoms at some point during the illness. You may be referred to a neurologist (specialist in nervous system disorders), who will carry out some tests to help confirm the diagnosis. Read more about how myasthenia gravis is diagnosed. Treating myasthenia gravis Although there's no cure for myasthenia gravis, treatments are available to help control the symptoms and improve muscle weakness.  Medication can be used to improve communication between the nerves and muscles, and to increase muscle strength. Immunosuppressants are a type of medication used to improve muscle strength by controlling the production of abnormal antibodies. In some cases of myasthenia gravis, surgery may be recommended to remove the thymus gland (a thymectomy). The thymus gland is found underneath the breastbone and is part of the immune system. It's often abnormal in people with myasthenia gravis. Read more about how myasthenia gravis is treated. Some people may experience a temporary or permanent period of remission (where there are no longer symptoms) and treatment can be stopped. Permanent remissions occur in about a third of all people who have a thymectomy. Removing a thymus gland tumour (thymoma) usually has little or no effect on the underlying myasthenia gravis. Who is affected by myasthenia gravis? Myasthenia gravis is a rare condition, affecting about 15 in every 100,000 people in the UK. It can develop at any age, but most commonly affects women under 40 years of age and men over 60. Cases of myasthenia gravis are increasing, particularly in people over 50, but the reasons for this increase aren't fully understood. Information about you If you have myasthenia gravis, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Another name for this condition is myelodysplasia. What happens in MDS? Normally, bone marrow produces: red blood cells to carry oxygen around your body white blood cells to help fight infection platelets to help your blood to clot In MDS, your bone marrow doesn't make enough healthy red blood cells, white blood cells and\/or platelets. Instead, it makes abnormal cells that are not fully developed. As the condition develops, your bone marrow becomes full of the abnormal blood cells, which spill out into your bloodstream. MDS can either be indolent (slow developing) or aggressive (rapid developing). The main types of MDS The main types of myelodysplasia are: refractory anaemia \u2013 just the red blood cells are affected refractory cytopenia \u2013 the red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets are affected refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB) \u2013 the red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets are affected, and there's a higher risk of developing acute leukaemia   \"Refractory\" means the condition doesn't respond to treatment that doctors would normally use for low blood cell counts. What are the symptoms? For most people, symptoms are mild at first and slowly get worse. You may initially experience: weakness, tiredness and occasional breathlessness \u2013 because of the low number of red blood cells frequent infections \u2013 because of the low number of white blood cells bruising and easy bleeding (such as nosebleeds) \u2013 because of the low number of platelets Some types of MDS develop more quickly than others. Some people with MDS don't have any symptoms, and their condition is picked up after they have blood tests for something else. Symptoms will depend on the type of MDS you have \u2013 for example, some people just have a problem with their red blood cells and have symptoms of anaemia, while others may lack all types of healthy blood cell. Who is affected? MDS can affect people of any age, but is most common in people aged 65-70 years. Only one in five people with MDS are younger than 50. What are the causes? In most cases, the cause is unknown \u2013 this is called primary MDS. However, exposure to the chemical benzene \u2013 used in the rubber industry, and found in petrol \u2013 is known to increase your risk of developing MDS. In rare cases, MDS is caused by radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment for cancer. This is known as secondary MDS, or treatment-related MDS. How is it diagnosed? MDS is diagnosed by carrying out blood tests and bone marrow tests. Blood tests will show how many normal and abnormal blood cells you have. A bone marrow test is done under local anaesthetic, which is injected into the area behind your hip bone. The doctor then passes a needle through your skin and into your bone, drawing out a sample of your bone marrow into a syringe. This will be sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope. The bone marrow test takes 15-20 minutes and can be done on the ward or in the outpatients department. Cancer risk Some people with MDS go on to develop acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is cancer of the white blood cells. This is known as \"transformation\". According to Cancer Research UK, the risk varies from five in every 100 cases (5%) to 65 out of every 100 cases (65%), depending on the type of MDS you have. It can take a few months or up to several years before transformation takes place. Ask your doctor about your risk of developing AML. How is MDS treated? Treatment will depend on your type of MDS, your risk group, and whether you have any other health conditions. The aim is to get the number and type of blood cells in your bloodstream back to normal, and manage symptoms with supportive treatment (see below). If your MDS has only a low risk of transforming into cancer, you may not need any treatment at first, and may just be monitored with regular blood tests. Supportive treatment Symptoms of MDS can be controlled with a combination of the following treatments: a blood transfusion \u2013 the drip may contain red blood cells or platelets, depending on which cells have been affected drugs to get rid of the excess iron in your blood (which builds up after a lot of blood transfusions) injections of growth factor drugs such as erythropoietin (which increases red blood cell count) or G-CSF (which increases white blood cells) to encourage your bone marrow to make more blood cells antibiotics to treat infections, if your white blood cell count is low Immunosuppression treatment Drugs such as anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) and ciclosporin reduce the activity of the immune system, allowing your bone marrow to make blood cells. It can also help to control symptoms. However, these drugs are not suitable for everyone and work best in young people and those who don't have a chromosome change associated with their condition. Chemotherapy If you're at a higher risk of developing AML, you will need prompt treatment with chemotherapy or a stem cell transplant (see below). Chemotherapy involves taking drugs that destroy the immature blood cells by disrupting their growth. The drugs are taken either as a tablet or an injection. If you have a higher risk of developing AML, your chemotherapy treatment will probably be similar to that used to treat AML. Read about the treatment of AML. You will probably have one or a combination of the following chemotherapy drugs: cytarabine fludarabine daunorubicin clofarabine azacitidine (this is for people with higher-risk MDS who are unable to have a stem cell transplant) Stem cell (bone marrow) transplant The only way to cure MDS is to have intensive treatment with a stem cell transplant from a donor \u2013 but this isn't suitable for everyone. A stem cell transplant will generally only be offered if you are young and in reasonably good health (apart from your MDS), as it's a very intensive treatment. It helps if you have a suitable donor in your family (a close relative, such as a brother or sister), although in some cases, it's possible to have a stem cell transplant using an unrelated donor with a matching tissue type. Treatment involves destroying your own bone marrow cells with chemotherapy and sometimes radiotherapy, before having stem cells from a donor fed into your bloodstream via a drip. Read more about having a stem cell transplant. Lenalidomide The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recently published new guidelines on a biological therapy called lenalidomide. Biological therapies work by affecting the way your immune system functions. Lenalidomide can be used to treat MDS in people with a specific genetic mutation, called an isolated deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality. This abnormality can lead to severe anaemia, which requires regular blood transfusions. Read the NICE guidelines on lenalidomide for treating myelodysplastic syndromes associated with an isolated deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality. Clinical trials The treatment of MDS is constantly evolving and new drugs are being tested all the time. You may be offered the chance to enter a clinical trial.

Bone marrow is the spongy tissue found at the centre of some bones. It produces the body's blood cells. Multiple myeloma affects the plasma cells (a type of blood cell) inside the bone marrow. Myeloma does not usually take the form of a lump or tumour. Instead, the myeloma cells divide and expand within the bone marrow, damaging the bones and affecting the production of healthy blood cells. Myeloma often affects many places in the body, which is why it is called multiple myeloma. Commonly affected areas include the spine, skull, pelvis and ribs. Signs and symptoms In the early stages, myeloma may not cause any symptoms. It's often only suspected or diagnosed after a routine blood or urine test. However, myeloma will eventually cause a wide range of problems, including: a persistent dull ache or specific areas of tenderness in your bones weak bones that break (fracture) easily tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath (caused by anaemia) repeated infections less commonly, bruising and unusual bleeding \u2013 such as frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums and heavy periods Read more about the symptoms of multiple myeloma. When to see your GP See your GP if you have any of the above symptoms. While they're unlikely to be caused by cancer, it's best to get a proper diagnosis. Your GP will examine you to check for bone tenderness, bleeding, signs of infection, and any other symptoms that suggest you may have myeloma. They may also arrange blood and urine tests that can detect abnormal proteins produced by myeloma cells. If myeloma is suspected, you will be referred to a consultant haematologist (a specialist in blood conditions) for further tests and treatment. Read more about diagnosing multiple myeloma. Who is affected? Multiple myeloma is an uncommon type of cancer, with around 4,800 new cases diagnosed each year in the UK. It's not known exactly what causes the condition, although it's more common in: people with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) \u2013 an excess number of protein molecules called immunoglobulins in your blood men adults over 60 \u2013 most cases are diagnosed at around the age of 70, and cases affecting people under the age of 40 are rare black people \u2013 multiple myeloma is about twice as common in black populations compared with white and Asian populations Read more about the causes of multiple myeloma. How multiple myeloma is treated There is currently no cure for multiple myeloma, but treatment can often help control it for several years. Treatment will often involve: a combination of anti-myeloma medications to destroy the myeloma cells medicines and procedures to prevent and treat problems caused by myeloma, such as bone pain, fractures and anaemia anti-myeloma medicines to control the cancer when it comes back (relapses) As part of your treatment, you may be asked if you want to take part in a clinical trial to help researchers develop better treatments for multiple myeloma. Read more about treating multiple myeloma. Outlook The outlook for multiple myeloma is improving all the time, but the condition still can't be completely cured. Research is ongoing to try to find new and better treatments. As with other types of cancer, the outlook depends on things such as your age and general health. Some people may live less than a year, while others may live 20 years or more. Overall, about 77 in every 100 people will live at least a year, 47 in every 100 will live at least five years, and 33 in every 100 will live at least 10 years. Support groups If you've been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, you may find it useful to contact a local or national support group, such as Myeloma UK. Support groups can offer more information and advice. They can also often put you in touch with other people in a similar situation so you can share advice and talk about your experiences. The Myeloma UK website has more information about how they can help you and finding a local support group.

Lack of blood to the heart can seriously damage the heart muscle. A heart attack is known medically as a myocardial infarction or MI. Symptoms can include: chest pain \u2013 the chest can feel like it is being pressed or squeezed by a heavy object, and pain can radiate from the chest to the jaw, neck, arms and back shortness of breath feeling weak and\/or lightheaded overwhelming feeling of anxiety It is important to stress that not everyone experiences severe chest pain; the pain can often be mild and mistaken for indigestion. It is the combination of symptoms that is important in determining whether a person is having a heart attack, and not the severity of chest pain. Read more about the symptoms of a heart attack. Treating heart attacks A heart attack is a medical emergency. Dial 999 and ask for an ambulance if you think you or someone you know is having a heart attack. If the casualty is not allergic to aspirin and it\u2019s easily available, give them a tablet (ideally 300mg) to slowly chew and then swallow while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. The aspirin will help to thin the blood and reduce the risk of a heart attack. Treatment for a heart attack will depend on how serious it is. Two main treatments are: using medication to dissolve blood clots surgery to help restore blood to the heart Read more about treating heart attacks. What causes a heart attack? Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart attacks. CHD is a condition in which coronary arteries (the major blood vessels that supply blood to the heart) get clogged up with deposits of cholesterol. These deposits are called plaques. Before a heart attack, one of the plaques ruptures (bursts), causing a blood clot to develop at the site of the rupture. The clot may then block the supply of blood running through the coronary artery, triggering a heart attack. Your risk of developing CHD is increased by: smoking a high-fat diet diabetes high cholesterol high blood pressure being overweight or obese Read more about the causes of heart attacks. Recovery The time it takes to recover from a heart attack will depend on the amount of damage to the heart muscle. Some people are well enough to return to work after two weeks. Other people may take several months to recover. The recovery process aims to: reduce your risk of another heart attack through a combination of lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, and medications, such as statins (which help lower blood cholesterol levels) gradually restore your physical fitness so you can resume normal activities (known as cardiac rehabilitation) Most people can return to work after having a heart attack, but how quickly will depend on your health, the state of your heart and the type of work you do. Read more about recovering from a heart attack. Who is affected Heart attacks are one of the most common reasons why a person requires emergency medical treatment. Men are more likely to have a heart attack than women. The British Heart Foundation estimates that around 50,000 men and 32,000 women have a heart attack each year in England. Most heart attacks occur in people aged over 45. Complications Complications of heart attacks can be serious and possibly life-threatening. These include: arrhythmia \u2013 this is an abnormal heartbeat, where the heart begins beating faster and faster, then stops beating (cardiac arrest) cardiogenic shock \u2013 where the heart's muscles are severely damaged and can no longer contract properly to supply enough blood to maintain many body functions heart rupture \u2013 where the heart\u2019s muscles, walls or valves split apart (rupture) These complications can occur quickly after a heart attack and are a leading cause of death. Many people will die suddenly from a complication of a heart attack before reaching hospital. Read more about the complications of a heart attack. Outlook The outlook for people who have had a heart attack can be highly variable, depending on: their age \u2013 the older you are, the more likely you are to experience serious complications the severity of the heart attack \u2013 specifically, how much of the heart's muscle has been damaged during the attack how long it took before a person received treatment \u2013 the longer the delay, the worse the outlook tends to be In general, around one third of people who have a heart attack die as a result. These deaths often occur before a person reaches hospital or, alternatively, within the first 28 days after the heart attack. If a person survives for 28 days after having a heart attack, their outlook improves dramatically and most people will go on to live for many years.

Doctors sometimes refer to the condition as \"myofascial pain disorder\". It's been estimated that up to 30% of adults will experience TMD at some point in their lives. The condition itself isn't usually serious, and the symptoms it can cause \u2013 including pain, jaw joint clicking or popping, and difficulties eating \u2013 usually only last a few months before getting better. However, these symptoms can significantly lower quality of life, and specialist treatment might be required if they're severe. What are the symptoms? TMD can cause: clicking, popping or grating noises as you chew or move your mouth muscle pain around the jaw pain in front of the ear that may spread to the cheek, ear and temple difficulty opening the mouth \u2013 the jaw may feel tight, as if it is stuck, making eating difficult headache or migraine earache or a \"buzzing\" or blocked sensation in the ear pain in other areas of the body \u2013 such as neckache or backache These symptoms may lead to related symptoms, such as disturbed sleep. What are the causes? Possible causes of TMD include: clenching your jaw or grinding your teeth during sleep (bruxism) \u2013 which overworks the jaw muscles and puts pressure on the joint (often caused by stress) wear and tear of the inside of the jaw joint \u2013 usually caused by osteoarthritis injury to the jaw joint \u2013 for example, after a blow to the face or surgery stress \u2013 some people may inherit increased sensitivity to pain or stress uneven bite \u2013 for example, when new fillings, dental crowns or dentures are fitted specific diseases \u2013 TMD may be associated with specific diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout or fibromyalgia However, some people may develop TMD without an obvious cause being found. How is TMD treated? If you have TMD, see your GP or dentist first for diagnosis and to discuss treatment options. Generally, non-surgical treatments such as lifestyle changes and self-help physiotherapy-type treatments are tried first. A small number of people with severe TMD may be referred to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon to discuss further treatment options. Lifestyle changes There are a number of self-help measures that can help improve TMD, including: resting the joint by eating soft food and avoiding chewing gum holding a warm or cold flannel to the jaw for 10-20 minutes, several times a day doing a few gentle jaw-stretching exercises \u2013 your healthcare professional can recommend appropriate exercises avoiding opening the joint too wide until the pain settles avoiding clenching the teeth for long periods of time massaging the muscles around the joint relaxation techniques to relieve stress not resting your chin on your hand Mouth guards Mouth guards (plastic devices that fit over your teeth) may be helpful if you grind your teeth. These cover the teeth at night to reduce jaw clenching and teeth grinding, and can be made to measure by your dentist. Read more about treatments for teeth grinding. Medication Painkillers such as paracetamol, ibuprofen or codeine can help relieve the pain associated with TMD. If these aren't enough to control the pain, your doctor may prescribe stronger medication such as a muscle relaxant or antidepressant. Steroid injections If TMD is caused by a disease such as arthritis, a steroid injection into the jaw joint can help reduce pain and swelling in a joint or the surrounding soft tissue. Most people report feeling less pain within the first 24 hours to one week. You may find your pain improves for a period of a few weeks to several months and, in some cases, the injection resolves the pain completely. Read more about corticosteroids (steroids). Surgery If the above measures don't help and the source of your symptoms is the temporomandibular joint \u2013 rather than the chewing muscles \u2013 your specialist may suggest a surgical treatment such as arthrocentesis (joint wash-out). Open joint surgery may be considered in the rare cases where there is an abnormality within the joint. Total joint replacement may be recommended for an extremely small number of people with severe, long-lasting symptoms and impaired jaw function. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced guidelines on this procedure. Read the NICE 2009 guidelines on artificial total temporomandibular joint replacement. All joint surgery can have significant side effects and you should discuss these with your surgeon. Outlook Most cases of TMD improve over time and do not get worse, and most people will not need surgery. In the meantime, symptoms can often be improved with the treatments mentioned above.

It's thought to affect up to one in three people in the UK and is becoming more common. Short-sightedness can range from mild, where treatment may not be required, to severe, where a person's vision is significantly affected. The condition usually starts around puberty and gets gradually worse until the eye is fully grown, but it can also develop in very young children. Signs that your child may be short-sighted can include: needing to sit near the front of the class at school because they find it difficult to read the whiteboard sitting close to the TV complaining of headaches or tired eyes regularly rubbing their eyes Getting your eyes tested If you think you or your child may be short-sighted, you should book an eye test at a local opticians. Find an opticians near you. You should have a routine eye test at least every two years, but you can have a test at any point if you have any concerns about your vision. An eye test can confirm whether you're short or long-sighted, and you can be given a prescription for glasses or contact lenses to correct your vision. For some people \u2013 such as children under 16, or those under 19 and in full-time education \u2013 eye tests are available free of charge on the NHS. Read about NHS eyecare entitlements to check if you qualify. Read more about diagnosing short-sightedness. What causes short-sightedness? Short-sightedness usually occurs when the eyes grow slightly too long. This means that light doesn't focus on the light-sensitive tissue (retina) at the back of the eye properly. Instead, the light rays focus just in front of the retina, resulting in distant objects appearing blurred. It's not clear exactly why this happens, but it often runs in families and has been linked to focusing on nearby objects, such as books and computers, for long periods during childhood. Ensuring your child regularly spends time playing outside may help to reduce their risk of becoming short-sighted. Read more about the causes of short-sightedness. Treatments for short-sightedness Short-sightedness can usually be corrected effectively with a number of treatments. The main treatments are: corrective lenses \u2013 such as glasses or contact lenses to help the eyes focus on distant objects laser eye surgery to alter the shape of the eye \u2013 this isn't usually available on the NHS and shouldn't be carried out on children, whose eyes are still developing artificial lens implants \u2013 where a man-made lens is permanently inserted into the eyes to help them focus correctly; these are also not usually available on the NHS Read more about treating short-sightedness. Associated eye conditions Some adults with severe short-sightedness and young children with untreated short-sightedness are more likely to develop other eye problems. These can include: a squint \u2013 a common childhood condition where the eyes point in different directions a lazy eye \u2013  a childhood condition where the vision in one eye doesn't develop properly glaucoma \u2013 increased pressure inside the eyes cataracts \u2013 where cloudy patches develop inside the lens of the eye retinal detachment \u2013 where the retina pulls away from the blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients Page last reviewed: 02\/09\/2015 Next review due: 02\/09\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The symptoms are muscle weakness, tripping or falling, and fatigue (tiredness) after walking or standing. It can feel like permanently having the flu. If the throat or chest muscles are affected, it can cause difficulty swallowing or breathing. Myositis can result from infection, certain medications or, most commonly, an underlying problem with the immune system. Dermatomyositis and polymyositis are types of myositis caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the muscles as if they were invading germs. When the immune system attacks the body in this way, it's known as an autoimmune disease. What is dermatomyositis, and who is at risk? Dermatomyositis affects the skin as well as the muscles, and sometimes also affects the joints, lungs and heart. It causes skin rashes on the face and on the back of the hands. The muscles may feel painful and tender. Dermatomyositis is usually an autoimmune disease, but it is not known why the immune system malfunctions in this way. It can be associated with other autoimmune diseases, too, such as thyroid disease and diabetes, and can also be associated with cancer.  Dermatomyositis can affect adults or children, and is more common in women. There's no cure, but symptoms can be treated with medication. What is polymyositis, and who is at risk? Polymyositis affects many different muscles in the body, especially the shoulders, hips and thigh muscles, but there's no skin rash. The muscle weakness may vary from week to week or month to month, although it tends to steadily get worse without treatment. It can be difficult to get up from a chair, climb stairs, lift objects, and comb hair. The aching and muscle weakness can become so severe that even picking up a cup of tea is difficult. If neck muscles are affected, it may be difficult to hold the head up.  Like dermatomyositis, polymyositis is an autoimmune disease that can be associated with cancer and other autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes, thyroid disease and myasthenia gravis. It's more common in women than men, and tends to affect people aged between 30 and 60. How are these conditions treated? You may be referred to a physiotherapist, who can advise you on a manageable exercise programme to maintain muscle strength. Speech and language therapy may be needed if you have swallowing difficulties. Medication The main drug treatment for myositis is steroid medication, which can include: steroid creams for the affected areas of skin in dermatomyositis higher doses of steroid tablets if there is severe muscle weakness High doses of steroids can cause side effects such as weight gain, high blood pressure, diabetes, cataracts and osteoporosis. Learn more about the side effects of steroid medication. Doctors may prescribe an additional medication that suppresses the immune system, such as azathioprine, methotrexate or cyclophosphamide. These are slow to act, but in the long term may allow you to reduce the dose of steroids and therefore reduce the risk of their side effects. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may be needed in very severe cases of myositis if you have severe muscle weakness causing life-threatening breathing or swallowing problems.  It involves having an injection of normal antibodies from donated blood. This temporarily changes the way your immune system operates. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy can produce a rapid improvement in the symptoms of myositis, but these drugs are very expensive and the benefits usually only last a few weeks. It is therefore not suitable as a long-term treatment, and is usually only used to treat people who are seriously ill while they are waiting for other treatments to become effective.  What is the outlook? Some people with either dermatomyositis or polymyositis respond well to medication. They may sometimes be able to stop using all steroids when their symptoms stop (while they're \"in remission\"), although most patients need to continue to take immunosuppressant medications long term. In time \u2013 usually years \u2013 it may be possible for some patients to stop all immunosuppressant medication if they remain well. Other patients respond less well to medication and find the disease affects their everyday activities and quality of life.
