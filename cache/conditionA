The abdominal aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body and is usually around 2cm wide \u2013 roughly the width of a garden hose. However, it can swell to over 5.5cm \u2013 what doctors class as a large AAA. Large aneurysms are rare, but can be very serious. If a large aneurysm bursts, it causes huge internal bleeding and is usually fatal. The bulging occurs when the wall of the aorta weakens. Although what causes this weakness is unclear, smoking and high blood pressure are thought to increase the risk of an aneurysm. AAAs are most common in men aged over 65. A rupture accounts for more than 1 in 50 of all deaths in this group and a total of 6,000 deaths in England and Wales each year. This is why all men are invited for a screening test when they turn 65. The test involves a simple ultrasound scan, which takes around 10-15 minutes. Symptoms of an AAA In most cases, an AAA causes no noticeable symptoms. However, if it becomes large, some people may develop a pain or a pulsating feeling in their abdomen (tummy) or persistent back pain. An AAA doesn\u2019t usually pose a serious threat to health, but there\u2019s a risk that a larger aneurysm could burst (rupture). A ruptured aneurysm can cause massive internal bleeding, which is usually fatal. Around 8 out of 10 people with a rupture either die before they reach hospital or don\u2019t survive surgery. The most common symptom of a ruptured aortic aneurysm is sudden and severe pain in the abdomen. If you suspect that you or someone else has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Read more about the symptoms of an AAA. Causes of an AAA It's not known exactly what causes the aortic wall to weaken, although increasing age and being male are known to be the biggest risk factors. There are other risk factors you can do something about, including smoking and having high blood pressure and cholesterol level. Having a family history of aortic aneurysms also means that you have an increased risk of developing one yourself. Read more about the causes of an AAA. Diagnosing an AAA Because AAAs usually cause no symptoms, they tend to be diagnosed either as a result of screening or during a routine examination \u2013 for example, if a GP notices a pulsating sensation in your abdomen. The screening test is an ultrasound scan, which allows the size of your abdominal aorta to be measured on a monitor. This is also how an aneurysm will be diagnosed if your doctor suspects you have one. Read more about diagnosing an AAA. Treating an AAA If a large AAA is detected before it ruptures, most people will be advised to have treatment, to prevent it rupturing. This is usually done with surgery to replace the weakened section of the blood vessel with a piece of synthetic tubing. If surgery is not advisable \u2013 or if you decide not to have it \u2013 there are a number of non-surgical treatments that can reduce the risk of an aneurysm rupturing. They include medications to lower your cholesterol and blood pressure, and quitting smoking. You will also have the size of your aneurysm checked regularly with ultrasound scanning. Read more about treating AAAs. Prevention The best way to prevent getting an aneurysm \u2013 or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing \u2013 is to avoid anything that could damage your blood vessels, such as: smoking eating a high-fat diet not exercising regularly being overweight or obese Read more about preventing aneurysms. Screening Men who are 65 and over are offered a screening test to check if they have an AAA. All men in England are invited for screening in the year they turn 65. Men who are over 65 and have not previously been screened can request a screening test by contacting their local AAA screening service directly. Women and men under 65 are not invited for screening. However, if you feel you have an increased risk of having an AAA, talk to your GP who can still refer you for a scan. Read more about screening for an AAA.

An aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall. As blood passes through the weakened blood vessel, the blood pressure causes it to bulge outwards. Exactly what causes the blood vessel wall to weaken is unclear, though hardening of the arteries, smoking and high blood pressure are thought to increase the risk of an aneurysm. Aneurysms can occur anywhere in the body, but the two most common places for them to form are in the abdominal aorta and the brain. A burst abdominal aortic aneurysm is also a medical emergency and is usually fatal.

This swelling is far more common in men aged over 65 than it is in women and younger men, so men are invited for screening in the year they turn 65. An AAA usually causes no symptoms, but if it bursts, it\u2019s extremely dangerous and usually fatal. Around 8 out of 10 people with a ruptured AAA either die before they reach hospital or don\u2019t survive surgery. Read more about abdominal aortic aneurysm. Screening involves a simple ultrasound scan of your stomach (abdomen), which takes about 10-15 minutes. If your abdominal aorta is not enlarged, you don\u2019t ever need to be tested again. If you have a small to medium aneurysm, you'll be regularly monitored to check it doesn\u2019t get dangerously larger. If you are found to have a large aneurysm, you'll be seen by a vascular surgeon (a specialist in blood vessels) within two weeks. They will advise on whether you would benefit from treatment to reduce the risk of it bursting. Why have AAA screening? An AAA is sometimes picked up by chance \u2013 for instance, if you\u2019re being tested for another condition. In general, if you have an AAA, you won\u2019t know. You probably won\u2019t feel any pain or notice anything different. But if the aneurysm bursts, it\u2019s a medical emergency, and most people either die before they reach hospital or don\u2019t survive surgery. Screening is a way of detecting an aneurysm early. If a large aneurysm is detected before it bursts it can be treated. Accepting the invitation to screening cuts the risk of dying from an abdominal aortic aneurysm by about half. The NHS AAA Screening Programme was set up in England in 2009 and has been offered throughout the UK since the end of 2013. Read more about why screening is offered.  When AAA screening is offered Men aged over 65 are far more likely to have an AAA than women or younger men \u2013 so any man registered with a GP will receive a letter inviting him for screening in the year he turns 65. Men aged over 65 can request a scan by contacting their local AAA screening service directly. Read more about when AAA screening is offered.  What happens during AAA screening? The screening test for AAA is a simple, pain-free ultrasound scan of the abdomen that usually takes about 10-15 minutes. The screening technician will ask you to lift up your shirt and then run a small ultrasound scanner on your abdomen, which will allow the thickness of your abdominal aorta to be measured on a monitor. The technician will tell you the result straight away and your GP will also be informed. Read more about what happens during AAA screening.  Results What happens next depends on the size of your abdominal aorta: If it\u2019s normal, you won\u2019t ever be invited for another screening. An aneurysm grows so slowly that you\u2019re unlikely to develop one after the age of 65. If you have a small to medium-sized aneurysm, you\u2019ll be invited back for regular scans to check its size. If you have a large AAA, you\u2019ll be referred to hospital to be seen by a vascular surgeon within two weeks. You will then be advised about treatment options but, generally, men with a large AAA are advised that the risk of a large aneurysm rupturing is more dangerous than having surgery to repair it.

It's usually short-lived and is often not serious. Severe abdominal pain is a greater cause for concern. If it starts suddenly and unexpectedly, it should be regarded as a medical emergency, especially if the pain is concentrated in a particular area. Call your GP as soon as possible or go to your nearest hospital accident and emergency (A&E) department if this is the case. If you feel pain in the area around your ribs, read about chest pain for information and advice. Stomach cramps with bloating Stomach cramps with bloating are often caused by trapped wind. This is a very common problem that can be embarrassing, but is easily dealt with. Your chemist will be able to recommend a product such as buscopan or mebeverine, which can be bought over the counter to treat the problem. Sudden stomach cramps with diarrhoea If your stomach cramps have started recently and you also have diarrhoea, the cause may be a tummy bug (gastroenteritis). This means you have a viral or bacterial infection of the stomach and bowel, which should get better without treatment after a few days. Gastroenteritis may be caused by coming into close contact with someone who's infected, or by eating contaminated food (food poisoning). If you have repeated bouts of stomach cramps and diarrhoea, you may have a long-term condition, such as irritable bowel syndrome. Sudden severe abdominal pain If you have sudden agonising pain in a particular area of your tummy, call your GP immediately or go to your nearest A&E department. It may be a sign of a serious problem that could rapidly get worse without treatment. Serious causes of sudden severe abdominal pain include: appendicitis \u2013 the swelling of the appendix (a finger-like pouch connected to the large intestine), which causes agonising pain in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen, and means your appendix will need to be removed a bleeding or perforated stomach ulcer \u2013 a bleeding, open sore in the lining of your stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) acute cholecystitis \u2013 inflammation of the gallbladder, which is often caused by gallstones; in many cases, your gallbladder will need to be removed kidney stones \u2013 small stones may be passed out in your urine, but larger stones may block the kidney tubes, and you'll need to go to hospital to have them broken up diverticulitis \u2013 inflammation of the small pouches in the bowel that sometimes requires treatment with antibiotics in hospital If your GP suspects you have one of these conditions, they may refer you to hospital immediately. Sudden and severe pain in your abdomen can also sometimes be caused by an infection of the stomach and bowel (gastroenteritis). It may also be caused by a pulled muscle in your abdomen or by an injury. Long-term or recurring abdominal pain See your GP if you or your child have persistent or repeated abdominal pain. The cause is often not serious and can be managed. Possible causes in adults include: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \u2013 a common condition that causes bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea or constipation; the pain is often relieved when you go to the toilet inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) \u2013 long-term conditions that involve inflammation of the gut, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis a urinary tract infection that keeps returning \u2013 in these cases, you will usually also experience a burning sensation when you urinate constipation  period pain \u2013 painful muscle cramps in women that are linked to the menstrual cycle other stomach-related problems \u2013 such as a stomach ulcer, heartburn and acid reflux, or gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining) Possible causes in children include: constipation a urinary tract infection that keeps returning heartburn and acid reflux  abdominal migraines \u2013 recurrent episodes of abdominal pain with no identifiable cause Page last reviewed: 15\/12\/2014 Next review due: 15\/12\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's not usually serious and most people get better within a few days without treatment. In most cases of food poisoning, the food is contaminated by bacteria, such as salmonella or Escherichia coli (E. coli), or a virus, such as the norovirus. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of food poisoning usually begin within one to two days of eating contaminated food, although they may start at any point between a few hours and several weeks later. The main symptoms include: feeling sick (nausea) vomiting diarrhoea, which may contain blood or mucus stomach cramps and abdominal (tummy) pain a lack of energy and weakness loss of appetite a high temperature (fever) aching muscles chills In most cases, these symptoms will pass in a few days and you will make a full recovery. What to do Most people with food poisoning recover at home and don't need any specific treatment, although there are some situations where you should see your GP for advice (see below). Until you feel better, you should rest and drink fluids to prevent dehydration. Try to drink plenty of water, even if you can only sip it. Eat when you feel up to it, but try small, light meals at first and stick to bland foods \u2013 such as toast, crackers, bananas and rice \u2013 until you begin to feel better. Oral rehydration solutions (ORS), which are available from pharmacies, are recommended for more vulnerable people, such as the elderly and those with another health condition. Read more about treating food poisoning. When to see your GP You should contact your GP if: your symptoms are severe \u2013 for example, if you're unable to keep down any fluids because you are vomiting repeatedly your symptoms don't start to improve after a few days you have symptoms of severe dehydration, such as confusion, a rapid heartbeat, sunken eyes and passing little or no urine you're pregnant you're over 60 your baby or young child has suspected food poisoning you have a long-term underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), heart valve disease, diabetes or kidney disease you have a weak immune system \u2013 for example, because of medication, cancer treatment or HIV In these situations, your GP may send off a stool sample for analysis and prescribe antibiotics, or they may refer you to hospital so you can be looked after more closely. How is food contaminated? Food can become contaminated at any stage during production, processing or cooking. For example, it can be contaminated by: not cooking food thoroughly (particularly meat) not correctly storing food that needs to be chilled at below 5C leaving cooked food for too long at warm temperatures not sufficiently reheating previously cooked food someone who is ill or who has dirty hands touching the food eating food that has passed its \"use by\" date the spread of bacteria between contaminated foods (cross-contamination) Foods particularly susceptible to contamination if not handled, stored or cooked properly include: raw meat and poultry raw eggs raw shellfish unpasteurised milk \"ready-to-eat\" foods, such as cooked sliced meats, pâté, soft cheeses and pre-packed sandwiches Read more about the causes of food poisoning and preventing food poisoning.

It's usually caused by a bacterial or viral tummy bug. It affects people of all ages, but is particularly common in young children. Most cases in children are caused by a virus called rotavirus. Cases in adults are usually caused by norovirus (the \"winter vomiting bug\") or bacterial food poisoning. Gastroenteritis can be very unpleasant, but it usually clears up by itself within a week. You can normally look after yourself or your child at home until you're feeling better. Try to avoid going to your GP, as gastroenteritis can spread to others very easily. Call NHS 111 or your GP if you're concerned or need any advice. This page covers: Symptoms of gastroenteritis What to do if you have gastroenteritis When to get medical advice Looking after a child with gastroenteritis Getting medical advice for your child How gastroenteritis is spread Preventing gastroenteritis Symptoms of gastroenteritis The main symptoms of gastroenteritis are: sudden, watery diarrhoea feeling sick vomiting, which can be projectile a mild fever Some people also have other symptoms, such as a loss of appetite, an upset stomach, aching limbs and headaches. The symptoms usually appear up to a day after becoming infected. They typically last less than a week, but can sometimes last longer. What to do if you have gastroenteritis If you experience sudden diarrhoea and vomiting, the best thing to do is stay at home until you're feeling better. There's not always a specific treatment, so you have to let the illness run its course. You don't usually need to get medical advice, unless your symptoms don't improve or there's a risk of a more serious problem (see When to get medical advice). To help ease your symptoms: Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration \u2013 You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Water is best, but you could also try fruit juice and soup. Take paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains. Get plenty of rest. If you feel like eating, try small amounts of plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread. Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if you have signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth or dark urine \u2013 read about treating dehydration. Take anti-vomiting medication (such as metoclopramide) and\/or antidiarrhoeal medication (such as loperamide) if you need to \u2013 some types are available from pharmacies, but check the leaflet that comes with the medicine. You can also ask your pharmacist or GP for advice about whether they're suitable.  Gastroenteritis can spread very easily, so you should wash your hands regularly while you're ill and stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after your symptoms have cleared, to reduce the risk of passing it on (see Preventing gastroenteritis). When to get medical advice You don't normally need to see your GP if you think you have gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own. Visiting your GP surgery can put others at risk, so it's best to call NHS 111 or your GP if you're concerned or feel you need advice. Get medical advice if: you have symptoms of severe dehydration, such as persistent dizziness, only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or if you're losing consciousness you have bloody diarrhoea you're vomiting constantly and are unable to keep down any fluids you have a fever over 38C (100.4F) your symptoms haven't started to improve after a few days in the last few weeks you've returned from a part of the world with poor sanitation you have a serious underlying condition, such as kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease or a weak immune system, and have diarrhoea and vomiting Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your poo to a laboratory to check what's causing your symptoms. Antibiotics may be prescribed if this shows you have a bacterial infection. Looking after a child with gastroenteritis You can look after your child at home if they have diarrhoea and vomiting. There's not usually any specific treatment and your child should start feeling better in a few days. You don't normally need to get medical advice unless their symptoms don't improve or there's a risk of a more serious problem (see Getting medical advice for your child). To help ease your child's symptoms: Encourage them to drink plenty of fluids. They need to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Water is generally best. Avoid giving them fizzy drinks or fruit juice, as they can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds. Make sure they get plenty of rest. Let your child eat if they're eating solids and feel hungry. Try small amounts of plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread. Give them paracetamol if they have an uncomfortable fever or aches and pains. Young children may find liquid paracetamol easier to swallow than tablets. Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if they're dehydrated. Your GP or pharmacist can advise on how much to give your child. Don't give them antidiarrhoeal and anti-vomiting medication, unless advised to by your GP or pharmacist. Make sure you and your child wash your hands regularly while your child is ill and keep them away from school or nursery until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared (see Preventing gastroenteritis). Getting medical advice for your child You don't usually need to see your GP if you think your child has gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own, and taking them to a GP surgery can put others at risk. Call NHS 111 or your GP if you're concerned about your child, or they: have symptoms of dehydration, such as passing less urine than normal, being unusually irritable or unresponsive, pale or mottled skin, or cold hands and feet have blood in their poo or green vomit are vomiting constantly and are unable to keep down any fluids or feeds have had diarrhoea for more than a week have been vomiting for three days or more have signs of a more serious illness, such as a high fever (over 38C or 100.4F), shortness of breath, rapid breathing, a stiff neck, a rash that doesn't fade when you roll a glass over it or a bulging fontanelle (the soft spot on a baby's head) have a serious underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease or a weak immune system, and have diarrhoea and vomiting Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your child's poo to a laboratory to confirm what's causing their symptoms. Antibiotics may be prescribed if this shows they have a bacterial infection. How gastroenteritis is spread The bugs that cause gastroenteritis can spread very easily from person to person. You can catch the infection if small particles of vomit or poo from an infected person get into your mouth, such as through: close contact with someone with gastroenteritis \u2013 they may breathe out small particles of vomit touching contaminated surfaces or objects  eating contaminated food \u2013 this can happen if an infected person doesn't wash their hands before handling food, or you eat food that has been in contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, or hasn't been stored and cooked at the correct temperatures (read more about the causes of food poisoning) A person with gastroenteritis is most infectious from when their symptoms start until 48 hours after all their symptoms have passed, although they may also be infectious for a short time before and after this. Preventing gastroenteritis It's not always possible to avoid getting gastroenteritis, but following the advice below can help stop it spreading: Stay off work, school or nursery until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have passed. You or your child should also avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time. Ensure you and your child wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, particularly after using the toilet and before preparing food. Don't rely on alcohol hand gels, as they're not always effective. Disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated. It's best to use a bleach-based household cleaner. Wash contaminated items of clothing or bedding separately on a hot wash. Don't share towels, flannels, cutlery or utensils while you or your child is ill. Flush away any poo or vomit in the toilet or potty and clean the surrounding area. Practice good food hygiene. Make sure food is properly refrigerated, always cook your food thoroughly, and never eat food that is past its use-by date \u2013 read more about preventing food poisoning.  Take extra care when travelling to parts of the world with poor sanitation, as you could pick up a stomach bug. For example, you may need to boil tap water before drinking it. Young children can have the rotavirus vaccination when they\u2019re two to three months old, which can reduce their risk of developing gastroenteritis.

It's more commonly known as \"passing wind\", or \"farting\". Farting is often laughed about, but excessive flatulence can be embarrassing and make you feel uncomfortable around others. However, it can usually be controlled with changes to your diet and lifestyle. Flatulence is a normal biological process and is something everyone experiences regularly. Some people pass wind only a few times a day, others a lot more, but the average is said to be about 5 to 15 times a day. Why it happens When you swallow food, water or saliva, you also swallow small amounts of air, which collects in the digestive system. Gases can also build up when you digest food. The body needs to get rid of the build-up by farting (flatulence) or burping (belching). Sometimes you may not notice you have passed wind because most of the gases are odourless and often released in small quantities. Flatulence usually only has a bad smell if it contains gases that smell, such as sulphur. However, it's important to remember it's normal for the gas you pass to sometimes smell a bit. Excessive flatulence can be caused by swallowing more air than usual or eating food that's difficult to digest. It can also be related to an underlying health problem affecting the digestive system, such as recurring indigestion or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Read more about the causes of flatulence. When to see your GP There are no medical guidelines defining the normal frequency or volume of flatulence. You're probably the best person to assess your own symptoms. See your GP if your flatulence is particularly troublesome \u2013 for example, if you're frequently passing smelly gas. You should also visit your GP if you experience additional symptoms, such as: persistent abdominal pain and bloating recurring episodes of diarrhoea or constipation unexplained weight loss bowel incontinence  blood in your stools (faeces) signs of an infection, such as a high temperature, vomiting, chills, joint pain and muscle pain These symptoms could be an indicator of a more serious health problem and may require investigation, such as a blood or stool test to look for an infection. Controlling the problem Excessive flatulence can usually be controlled by making changes to your diet and lifestyle, such as: avoiding foods known to cause flatulence eating smaller and more frequent meals eating and drinking slowly exercising regularly There are also some over-the-counter medications that can help if your flatulence is troublesome, such as charcoal tablets or simethicone. If your flatulence is related to an underlying health problem, treating the condition may help resolve it. Read more about treating flatulence.

It can involve removing fat and excess loose skin and tightening the abdominal muscles. The aim is to remove excess tummy skin that can't be removed through exercise - for example, after losing a lot of weight or after pregnancy. But it\u2019s not a quick fix for losing weight. An abdominoplasty is regarded cosmetic surgery, so not normally available on the NHS. If you're thinking of going ahead, make sure you're aware of the cost and the fact that it's major surgery, with risks to consider. Take time to reflect on your decision. It may help to read \"Is cosmetic surgery right for me?\". You can read on to find out: How much does it cost?  Where do I go?  What does it involve?  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems   Who shouldn't have it?  More information  How much does it cost? It costs about £4,500 to £6,000 to have an abdominoplasty in the UK, plus the cost of any consultations or follow-up care that may not be included in the price. Where do I go? If you're looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform a tummy tuck. All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC, which publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. You should also research the surgeon who is going to carry out your surgery. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor\u2019s fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many operations they've performed where there have been complications what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong their own patient satisfaction rates Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? There are two types of tummy tuck, and both are usually carried out under a general anaesthetic. A partial tummy tuck involves: making a large incision (cut) across the lower tummy separating the skin from the abdominal wall below the tummy button removing excess fat cutting away excess skin pulling together the remaining skin and stitching it in place A full tummy tuck involves: making a large incision across the lower tummy, from hip to hip, just above the pubic area making a second incision to free the belly button from the tissue that surrounds it separating the skin from the abdominal wall realigning the abdominal muscles removing excess fat and skin cutting a new hole for the belly button, and stitching this back in place pulling together the remaining skin and stitching it in place The operation can take between two and five hours. Most people need to stay in hospital for a few nights. A tummy tuck may be quite painful, although pain relief would be provided. You would leave hospital with dressings and a pressure garment (corset) on your tummy, or tummy control pants. Someone would need to drive you home and stay with you for the following 24 hours. Recovery You would need to take about four to six weeks off work and exercise. You wouldn't be able to drive for a few weeks after the operation (your surgeon and insurance company would advise about this). It takes about six weeks to fully recover, and it may be several weeks before you see the full effects of the tummy tuck. You\u2019d need to wear a special type of corset or tummy control pants to encourage your skin to heal properly and reduce any swelling. Generally, you'd need to take it easy for a few weeks and keep your knees bent while in bed, to avoid putting strain on your stitches. After a week or two: A wound check would be carried out At six weeks: Your corset should be able to come off and you'd usually be able to return to most of your normal activities. Side effects to expect You would be left with a scar running across your lower tummy and, if you had a full abdominoplasty, a scar around your belly button. It\u2019s also common after a tummy tuck to: find it difficult to stand up straight \u2013 it will feel like your tummy is being pulled (this will improve over time) have pain and bruises feel numbness in your tummy for a few months to years  have a temporary fluid-filled swelling above the scar have red, raised scars in the first six weeks \u2013 which eventually fade to white What could go wrong A tummy tuck can occasionally result in: thick, obvious scars developing bulges under the skin 'dog ears' (extra skin) at the edges of the scar wounds failing to heal a collection of fluid in the area that was operated on a collection of blood underneath the skin (haematoma) numbness or pain in the tummy or down the leg tummy cramps or pain breathing problems Any type of operation also carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding developing a blood clot in a vein infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic (very rare) The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, people find the desired effect wasn\u2019t achieved and feel they need another operation. What to do if you have problems  Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms. If you have a tummy tuck and are not happy with the results, or you think the procedure wasn't carried out properly, you should take up the matter with the surgeon who treated you. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC). Who shouldn't have it? A tummy tuck is not a procedure for someone who is overweight. If you're overweight, you can read our advice on how to lose weight safely and effectively.

It's also sometimes known as a termination. The pregnancy is ended either by taking medications or having a minor surgical procedure. One in three women will have an abortion in their lifetime. This page covers: How to get an abortion When it can be done Making a decision What happens Risks of an abortion How to get an abortion Abortions can only be carried out in an NHS hospital or a licensed clinic, and are usually available free of charge on the NHS. There are three main ways to get an abortion on the NHS: contact an abortion provider directly \u2013 the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), Marie Stopes UK and the National Unplanned Pregnancy Advisory Service (NUPAS) can tell you about eligibility and services in your area speak to your GP and ask for a referral to an abortion service \u2013 your GP should refer you to another doctor if he or she has any objections to abortion visit a contraception clinic, family planning clinic, sexual health clinic or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic and ask for a referral to an abortion service Waiting times can vary, but you shouldn't have to wait more than two weeks from your initial appointment to having an abortion. Abortions can also be paid for privately if you prefer. Costs for private abortions vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method used to carry out the procedure. When an abortion can be carried out Most abortions in England, Wales and Scotland are carried out before 24 weeks of pregnancy. They can be carried out after 24 weeks in certain circumstances \u2013 for example, if the mother's life is at risk or the child would be born with a severe disability. The length of your pregnancy is calculated from the first day of your last period. If you're not sure how long you've been pregnant, you may need an ultrasound scan to check. Abortions are simpler and safer the earlier they're carried out. Getting advice early on will give you more time to make a decision if you're unsure. Deciding to have an abortion Some women may be certain they want to have an abortion, while others may find it more difficult to make a decision. The decision to have an abortion is yours alone. But all women requesting an abortion should be offered the opportunity to discuss their options and choices with, and receive support from, a trained pregnancy counsellor. Impartial information and support is available from: your GP or another doctor at your GP practice a counselling service at the abortion clinic organisations such as the FPA, Brook (for under-25s), BPAS, Marie Stopes UK and NUPAS \u2013 but beware of so-called \"crisis pregnancy centres\" that claim to provide impartial advice but often do not You may also want to speak to your partner, friends or family, but you don't need to discuss it with anyone else and they don't have a say in the final decision. If you don't want to tell anyone, your details will be kept confidential. If you're under 16, your parents don't usually need to be told. Information about an abortion doesn't go on your medical record.  What happens during an abortion Before having an abortion, you'll attend an appointment to talk about your decision and what happens next. Whenever possible, you should be given a choice of how you would like the abortion to be carried out. There are two options: medical abortion (the \"abortion pill\") \u2013 you take two medications, usually 24 to 48 hours apart, to induce a miscarriage surgical abortion \u2013 you have a minor procedure to remove the pregnancy and normally go home soon afterwards After an abortion, you'll probably need to take things easy for a few days. It's likely you'll experience some discomfort and vaginal bleeding for up to two weeks. Read more about how an abortion is carried out. Risks of an abortion Abortions are safest if they're carried out as early as possible in pregnancy. Most women won't experience any problems, but there is a small risk of complications, such as: infection of the womb \u2013 occurs in up to 1 in every 10 abortions some of the pregnancy remaining in the womb \u2013 occurs in up to 1 in every 20 abortions excessive bleeding \u2013 occurs in about 1 in every 1,000 abortions damage to the entrance of the womb (cervix) \u2013 occurs in up to 1 in every 100 surgical abortions damage to the womb \u2013 occurs in 1 in every 250 to 1,000 surgical abortions and less than 1 in 1,000 medical abortions carried out at 12 to 24 weeks If complications do occur, further treatment \u2013 including surgery \u2013 may be required. Having an abortion won't affect your chances of becoming pregnant again and having normal pregnancies in the future. In fact, you may be able to get pregnant immediately afterwards and should use contraception if you want to avoid this. Read more about the risks of abortion.

Abscesses can develop anywhere in the body. This article focuses on two types of abscess: skin abscesses \u2013 which develop under the skin internal abscesses \u2013 which develop inside the body, in an organ or in the spaces between organs This topic covers: Symptoms When to see your GP Causes Treatment Prevention Other types of abscess Symptoms of an abscess A skin abscess often appears as a swollen, pus-filled lump under the surface of the skin. You may also have other symptoms of an infection, such as a high temperature (fever) and chills. It's more difficult to identify an abscess inside the body, but signs include: pain in the affected area a high temperature generally feeling unwell Read more about the symptoms of an abscess. When to see your GP See your GP if you think you may have an abscess. They can examine a skin abscess or refer you to hospital if you may have an internal abscess. There are several tests available to help diagnose an abscess, depending on where it's located. Read about diagnosing an abscess. Causes of abscesses Most abscesses are caused by a bacterial infection. When bacteria enter your body, your immune system sends infection-fighting white blood cells to the affected area. As the white blood cells attack the bacteria, some nearby tissue dies, creating a hole which then fills with pus to form an abscess. The pus contains a mixture of dead tissue, white blood cells and bacteria. Internal abscesses often develop as a complication of an existing condition, such as an infection elsewhere in your body. For example, if your appendix bursts as a result of appendicitis, bacteria can spread inside your tummy (abdomen) and cause an abscess to form. Read about the causes of abscesses. Treating an abscess A small skin abscess may drain naturally, or simply shrink, dry up and disappear without any treatment. However, larger abscesses may need to be treated with antibiotics to clear the infection, and the pus may need to be drained. This will usually be done either by inserting a needle through your skin or by making a small incision in the skin over the abscess. Read more about treating an abscess. Preventing a skin abscess Most skin abscesses are caused by bacteria getting into a minor wound, the root of a hair or a blocked oil or sweat gland. Ensuring that your skin is clean, healthy and largely free of bacteria can help reduce the risk of skin abscesses developing. You can reduce the risk of bacteria spreading by: washing your hands regularly encouraging people in your family to wash their hands regularly using separate towels and not sharing baths waiting until your skin abscess is fully treated and healed before using any communal equipment, such as gym equipment, saunas or swimming pools Don't squeeze the pus out of the abscess yourself, because this can easily spread the bacteria to other areas of your skin. If you use tissues to wipe any pus away from your abscess, dispose of them straight away to avoid germs spreading. Wash your hands after you've disposed of the tissues. Take care when shaving your face, legs, underarm areas or bikini area to avoid nicking your skin. Clean any wounds immediately and visit your GP or local NHS walk-in centre if you think there may be something trapped in your skin. Don't share razors or toothbrushes. Read more about looking after your skin. It may also help to reduce your risk of skin abscesses by: maintaining a healthy, balanced diet  losing weight if you're overweight or obese stopping smoking It's difficult to prevent internal abscesses, as they're often complications of other conditions. Other types of abscess There are many other types of abscess not fully covered here, including: an anorectal abscess \u2013 a build-up of pus in the rectum and anus a Bartholin's abscess \u2013 a build-up of pus inside one of the Bartholin's glands, which are found on each side of the opening of the vagina a brain abscess \u2013 a rare but potentially life-threatening build-up of pus inside the skull a dental abscess \u2013 a build-up of pus under a tooth or in the supporting gum and bone a quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) \u2013 a build-up of pus between one of your tonsils and the wall of your throat a pilonidal abscess \u2013 a build-up of pus in the skin of the cleft of the buttocks (where the buttocks separate) a spinal cord abscess \u2013 a build-up of pus around the spinal cord Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 19\/07\/2016 Next review due: 19\/07\/2019 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It usually occurs when bacteria or fungi enter the brain tissue after an infection or severe head injury. Although the risk of developing a brain abscess is extremely low in England, it is a life-threatening condition and should be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.  Symptoms of a brain abscess The symptoms of a brain abscess may develop quickly or slowly but can include: headache \u2013 which is often severe, located in a single section of the head and can't be relieved with painkillers changes in mental state \u2013 such as confusion or irritability problems with nerve function \u2013 such as muscle weakness, slurred speech or paralysis on one side of the body a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above  seizures (fits) nausea and vomiting stiff neck changes in vision \u2013 such as blurring, greying of vision or double vision (due to the abscess putting pressure on the optic nerve) When to seek medical advice Any symptoms that suggest a problem with the brain and nervous system should be treated as a medical emergency. These include: slurred speech muscle weakness or paralysis seizures occurring in a person with no previous history of seizures If you or someone you know experiences any of these symptoms, phone 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Any symptoms that suggest a worsening infection, such as fever and vomiting, should be reported to your GP immediately. If your GP isn't available, contact your local out-of-hours service or call NHS 111. Causes of a brain abscess There are three main ways a brain abscess can develop. These are: an infection in another part of the skull \u2013 such as an ear infection, sinusitis or dental abscess, which can spread directly into the brain an infection in another part of the body \u2013 for example, the infection that causes pneumonia spreading into the brain via the blood trauma, such as a severe head injury \u2013 that cracks open the skull, allowing bacteria or fungi to enter the brain However, in some cases, the source of the infection remains unknown. Read more about the causes of a brain abscess. Diagnosing a brain abscess If a brain abscess is suspected, an initial assessment will be made based on your symptoms, medical history and whether you've had a recent infection or a weakened immune system. Blood tests can also be carried out to check for an infection. If you're referred to hospital for further tests, you may have either: a computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 a series of X-rays are used to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u2013 which uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body. If an abscess is found, a procedure known as CT-guided aspiration may be used to remove a sample of pus for testing. This involves using a CT scan to guide a needle to the site of the abscess. Treating a brain abscess A brain abscess is regarded as a medical emergency. Swelling caused by the abscess can disrupt the blood and oxygen supply to the brain. There's also a risk of the abscess bursting (rupturing). If left untreated, a brain abscess can cause permanent brain damage and could be fatal. A brain abscess is usually treated using a combination of: medication \u2013 either antibiotics or antifungals surgery \u2013 either draining the pus through a hole in the skull (simple aspiration) or opening the skull and removing the abscess entirely (craniotomy) Treatment with antibiotics often begins before a diagnosis is confirmed, to reduce the risk of complications. Read more about treating a brain abscess. Complications of a brain abscess Complications of a brain abscess can include: a reoccurring abscess \u2013 seek immediate medical advice if you think there's even a small chance your abscess has reoccurred; this is more common in people with a weakened immune system or cyanotic heart disease brain damage \u2013 mild to moderate brain damage often improves with time but severe brain damage is likely to be permanent; brain damage is more of a risk if diagnosis and treatment are delayed epilepsy \u2013 where a person has repeated seizures (fits) meningitis \u2013 a life-threatening infection of the protective membranes around the brain, which requires urgent treatment; this is more common in children Page last reviewed: 20\/06\/2016 Next review due: 20\/06\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Most abscesses develop just under the skin and are caused by a bacterial infection. Breast abscesses are painful, swollen lumps that may also: be red feel hot cause the surrounding skin to swell cause a fever (high temperature) What causes a breast abscess?  Breast abscesses are often linked to mastitis \u2013 a condition that causes breast pain and swelling (inflammation), and usually affects women who are breastfeeding. Infections can occur during breastfeeding if bacteria enter your breast tissue, or if the milk ducts (tiny tubes) become blocked. This can cause mastitis which, if not treated, can result in an abscess forming. Women who aren't breastfeeding can also develop mastitis if bacteria enter the milk ducts through a sore or cracked nipple, or a nipple piercing. White blood cells are sent to attack the infection, which causes tissue at the site of the infection to die. This creates a small, hollow area that fills with pus (an abscess). Read more about what causes breast abscesses. When to visit your GP See your GP if your breast is red and sore. If you have mastitis, antibiotics may be prescribed to treat the infection. If your symptoms persist after taking antibiotics, your GP may refer you for an ultrasound scan, which will confirm whether you have a breast abscess. This type of scan uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body. Treating a breast abscess A breast abscess will need to be drained. Small breast abscesses can be drained using a needle and syringe. If the abscess is large, a small incision may be needed to drain the pus. For both procedures, a local anaesthetic will usually be given to numb the skin around the abscess so you don't feel any pain or discomfort. Read more about how breast abscesses are treated. Breast abscesses are painful, pus-filled lumps that develop under the skin of the breast  How common are breast abscesses? Breast abscesses most commonly affect women who are 18-50 years of age. They're often linked to mastitis, which affects up to 1 in 10 breastfeeding women and causes the breast to become red and sore. One study found that around 3% of women with mastitis who were treated with antibiotic medicines developed a breast abscess.

Preventing dental abscesses Symptoms of a dental abscess Symptoms of an abscess in your tooth or gum may include: an intense, throbbing pain in the affected tooth or gum that may come on suddenly and gets gradually worse pain that spreads to your ear, jaw and neck on the same side as the affected tooth or gum pain that's worse when lying down, which may disturb your sleep redness and swelling in your face a tender, discoloured and\/or loose tooth shiny, red and swollen gums sensitivity to hot or cold food and drink bad breath and\/or an unpleasant taste in your mouth If the infection spreads, you may also develop a high temperature (fever) and feel generally unwell. In severe cases, you may find it hard to fully open your mouth and have difficulty swallowing or breathing. What to do if you have a dental abscess You should see a dentist as soon as possible if you think you have a dental abscess. Avoid visiting your GP, as there is little they can do to help. You can get help from: your registered dentist \u2013 if it's out of hours, they should have an answerphone message with details of how to access out-of-hours dental treatment NHS 111 \u2013 who can give you details of dental services in your area your local clinical commissioning group (CCG) \u2013 who can tell you the phone number of your local dental access helpline your local accident and emergency (A&E) department \u2013 if there are no other options or you're having difficulty breathing You may have to pay for emergency NHS dental treatment, depending on your circumstances. Read about NHS dental charges. Relieving your symptoms While you're waiting to see a dentist, painkillers can help control your pain. Ibuprofen is the preferred painkiller for dental abscesses, but if you're unable to take it for medical reasons, you can take paracetamol instead. Aspirin shouldn't be given to children under 16. If one painkiller doesn't relieve the pain, taking both paracetamol and ibuprofen at the doses shown in the medicine leaflet may help. This is safe for adults, but not for children under 16. It may also help to: avoid hot or cold food and drink if it makes the pain worse try eating cool, soft foods if possible, using the opposite side of your mouth use a soft toothbrush and temporarily avoid flossing around the affected tooth These measures can help relieve your symptoms temporarily, but you shouldn't use them to delay getting help from a dentist. Treatments for a dental abscess Dental abscesses are treated by removing the source of the infection and draining away the pus. Depending on the location of the abscess and how severe the infection is, possible treatments include: removing the affected tooth (extraction) \u2013 this may be necessary if root canal treatment isn't possible root canal treatment \u2013 a procedure to remove the abscess from the root of an affected tooth before filling and sealing it incision and drainage \u2013 where a small cut (incision) is made in the gum to drain the abscess (this is usually only a temporary solution and further treatment may be needed) Local anaesthetic will usually be used to numb your mouth for these procedures. More extensive operations may be carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're asleep). Antibiotics aren't routinely prescribed for dental abscesses, but may be used if the infection spreads or is particularly severe. What causes dental abscesses? Your mouth is full of bacteria, which form a sticky film on your teeth called plaque. If you don't keep your teeth clean, acids produced by the bacteria in plaque can damage your teeth and gums, leading to tooth decay or gum disease. The following can increase your chances of developing a dental abscess: poor oral hygiene \u2013 plaque can build-up on your teeth if you don't floss and brush your teeth regularly consuming lots of sugary or starchy food and drink \u2013 these can encourage the growth of bacteria in plaque and may lead to decay that can result in an abscess an injury or previous surgery to your teeth or gums \u2013 bacteria can get into any damaged parts of the teeth or gums having a weakened immune system \u2013 this includes people with certain underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, and those having treatment, including steroid medication or chemotherapy  Preventing dental abscesses You can reduce your risk of developing dental abscesses by keeping your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. To do this, you should: use floss or an interdental brush at least once a day to clean between your teeth and under the gum line brush your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste twice a day \u2013 spending at least two minutes each time avoid rinsing your mouth with water or mouthwash after brushing because this washes the protective toothpaste away \u2013 just spit out any excess toothpaste cut down on sugary and starchy food and drinks \u2013 particularly between meals or shortly before going to bed visit your dentist regularly \u2013 your dentist can suggest how often you should have a check-up, based on your oral health  Read more on how to keep your teeth clean and dental check-ups.

Most women have a period every 28 days or so, but it's common to have a slightly shorter or longer cycle than this (from 24 to 35 days). Some women don't always have a regular menstrual cycle. Their period may be early or late, and how long it lasts and how heavy it is may vary each time. Read more about irregular periods and heavy periods. This page covers: Why your periods might stop When to see your GP Why your periods might stop There are a number of reasons why your periods can stop. The most common reasons are: pregnancy  stress  sudden weight loss  being overweight or obese extreme overexercising  taking the contraceptive pill reaching the menopause  polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)  Periods can also sometimes stop as a result of a long-term medical condition, such as heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes, an overactive thyroid, or premature ovarian failure. Pregnancy You might be pregnant if you're sexually active and your period is late. Pregnancy is a common reason why periods unexpectedly stop. It can sometimes happen if the contraception you're using fails. It might be that your period is simply late, so you could wait a few days to see if it arrives. If it doesn't arrive, you can do a pregnancy test to confirm whether or not you're pregnant. It's important to be aware that you can get pregnant in the days after your period is normally due. This can happen if the release of an egg (ovulation) is delayed \u2013 for example, as a result of illness or stress. Stress If you're stressed, your menstrual cycle can become longer or shorter, your periods may stop altogether, or they might become more painful. Try to avoid becoming stressed by making sure you have time to relax. Regular exercise, such as running, swimming and yoga, can help you relax. Breathing exercises can also help. If you're finding it hard to cope with stress, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be recommended. CBT is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and act. Sudden weight loss Excessive or sudden weight loss can cause your periods to stop. Severely restricting the amount of calories you eat stops the production of hormones needed for ovulation. Your GP may refer you to a dietitian if you're underweight, where you have a body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5. The dietitian will be able to advise you about how to regain weight safely. If your weight loss is caused by an eating disorder, such as anorexia, you'll be referred to a psychiatrist. Being overweight or obese Being overweight or obese can also affect your menstrual cycle. If you're overweight, your body may produce an excess amount of oestrogen, one of the hormones that regulate the reproductive system in women. The excess oestrogen can affect how often you have periods, and can also cause your periods to stop. Your GP may refer you to a dietitian if you're overweight or obese, with a BMI of 30 or more, and it's affecting your periods. The dietitian will be able to advise you about losing weight safely. Extreme overexercising The stress that intense physical activity places on your body can affect the hormones responsible for your periods. Losing too much body fat through intense exercise can also stop you ovulating. You'll be advised to reduce your level of activity if excessive exercise has caused your periods to stop. If you're a professional athlete, you may benefit from seeing a doctor who specialises in sports medicine. They'll be able to give you advice about how to maintain your performance without disrupting your periods. Contraceptive pill You might miss a period every so often if you're taking the contraceptive pill. This isn't usually a cause for concern. Some types of contraception, such as the progestogen-only pill, contraceptive injection and intrauterine system (IUS), particularly Mirena, can cause periods to stop altogether. However, your periods should return when you stop using these types of contraception. Menopause You may start missing periods as you approach the menopause. This is because oestrogen levels will start to decrease, and ovulation will become less regular. After the menopause, your periods will stop completely. The menopause is a natural part of the ageing process in women, which usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55. The average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 51 in the UK. However, around 1 in 100 women experience the menopause before the age of 40. This is known as premature menopause or premature ovarian failure. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Polycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless follicles, which are underdeveloped sacs in which eggs develop. If you have PCOS, these sacs are often unable to release an egg, which means ovulation doesn't take place. PCOS is thought to be very common, affecting about 1 in every 10 women in the UK. The condition is responsible for as many as one in three cases of stopped periods. When to see your GP See your GP if you're not pregnant \u2013 you've had a negative pregnancy test \u2013 and you've missed more than three periods in a row. If you're sexually active and you haven't taken a pregnancy test, your GP may advise you to take one. They may also ask you about: your medical history your family's medical history your sexual history any emotional issues you're having any recent changes in your body weight the amount of exercise you do Your GP may recommend waiting to see whether your periods return on their own. In some cases you may need treatment for your periods to return. You should also see your GP if your periods stop before you're 45 or you're still bleeding when you're over 55. Referral to a specialist If your GP thinks an underlying medical condition might have caused your periods to stop, they may refer you to a specialist. Depending on what your GP suspects is causing the problem, you may be referred to: a gynaecologist \u2013 a specialist in treating conditions that affect the female reproductive system an endocrinologist \u2013 a specialist in treating hormonal conditions You may have a full gynaecological examination and various tests, including: blood tests \u2013 to see whether you have abnormal levels of certain hormones, such as prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, or luteinising hormone an ultrasound scan, CT scan or MRI scan \u2013 to identify any problems with your reproductive system or the pituitary gland in your brain  Treating underlying conditions If test results indicate an underlying medical condition has caused your periods to stop, you may be offered treatment for your condition. For example, if the cause is PCOS, you may be advised to take the contraceptive pill or tablets containing a hormone called progesterone. Read more about the treatment of PCOS. If the cause is early menopause (premature ovarian failure), this means the ovaries no longer function normally. Hormone medication is usually recommended. Treatments to try include the contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Read about Johanna's experience of premature ovarian failure. If you have an overactive thyroid gland, you may be given medication to stop your thyroid gland producing too many hormones.  Read more about treating an overactive thyroid gland.

It's not a condition in itself, but can be a sign of an underlying health problem. These underlying conditions aren't usually serious, although occasionally acanthosis nigricans can be sign of cancer. Signs and symptoms Dark, velvety patches If you have acanthosis nigricans, you'll have thickened, brownish-grey or black patches of skin. The patches will be dry and rough, feeling similar to velvet. They may also be itchy. These patches may occur anywhere, but are usually seen around the neck, in the armpit, around the groin and sometimes in other skin folds. Occasionally, the skin over the joints of the fingers and toes may be affected, as well as the lips, palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The patches usually develop slowly over time. Patches that grow and spread quickly are more likely to be associated with cancer. In these cases, the mouth, tongue, throat, nose and windpipe may also be affected.  Tiny growths on the skin You may also have lots of tiny finger-like growths from the patches. This is known as papillomatosis. There may also be skin tags around the affected area. These are small flesh-coloured or pigmented growths that hang off the skin and look a bit like warts.  When to see your GP Acanthosis nigricans is usually harmless, but as it can be a sign of something serious it's a good idea to see your GP if you think you have it. They may suspect acanthosis nigricans just by looking at your skin. If the cause isn't clear, you may have blood tests to check your blood sugar or hormone levels, and you might need additional tests such as an endoscopy or X-ray. What causes acanthosis nigricans? Acanthosis nigricans sometimes occurs in people who are otherwise in good health, particularly dark-skinned people of African descent. However, in most cases it's a sign of an underlying problem or condition such as obesity, diabetes or abnormal hormone levels. Some of the main causes of acanthosis nigricans are outlined below. Obesity Acanthosis nigricans is usually the result of obesity. This is known as obesity-associated acanthosis nigricans. It occurs because obesity can cause insulin resistance (when the body is unable to properly use the hormone insulin), which may lead to high levels of insulin in the blood, affecting the skin cells. Insulin resistance can also cause type 2 diabetes, so acanthosis nigricans can be an early sign that you have diabetes or are at risk of developing the condition. Syndromes and hormone problems Acanthosis nigricans is sometimes associated with an underlying syndrome or hormone problem, such as: polycystic ovary syndrome \u2013 a condition that affects how a woman's ovaries work, which can cause excessive body hair, irregular periods, infertility, acne and weight gain Cushing's syndrome \u2013 symptoms such as weight gain, bruising and stretch marks caused by very high levels of the hormone cortisol in the body acromegaly \u2013 where the body produces too much growth hormone, leading to the excess growth of body tissues over time underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) \u2013 where your thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones, causing symptoms such as tiredness and weight gain This type of acanthosis nigricans is known as syndromic acanthosis nigricans. Medication Acanthosis nigricans is sometimes triggered by medicines, including insulin, corticosteroids, and hormone treatments such as human growth hormone or the contraceptive pill. This is known as drug-induced or medication-associated acanthosis nigricans. Genes In rare cases, acanthosis nigricans can be caused by a faulty gene inherited directly from your parents. This is known as familial or benign genetic acanthosis nigricans. This type is usually passed on in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means it can be passed on if only one of your parents carries the faulty gene. Cancer  If the dark skin patches come on suddenly and spread quickly, it may be a sign you have cancer (usually stomach cancer). This is known as malignant acanthosis nigricans. This is a rare condition that tends to affect middle-aged or elderly people, regardless of their weight or ethnic background. The patches are more severe and the mouth, tongue and lips may also be affected. The skin may also become irritated and itchy. How acanthosis nigricans is treated Treatment for acanthosis nigricans aims to correct the underlying cause of your symptoms. This will usually cure the acanthosis nigricans or significantly improve the appearance of your skin. Treatments that may be recommended include: losing weight, making changes to your diet and taking medication to reduce the level of insulin in your blood taking medication to correct your hormone levels \u2013 read about treating Cushing's syndrome, treating polycystic ovary syndrome and treating an underactive thyroid switching to a different medication if it's triggering your symptoms surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy for cancer There's no specific treatment to get rid of the patches, but a dermatologist (skin specialist) may be able to recommend treatments such as creams or tablets that may help improve the look of your skin. Outlook Most cases of acanthosis nigricans are harmless and not a sign of anything serious. The skin patches often fade with time as the underlying condition is treated. If you have inherited acanthosis nigricans from your parents, your patches may gradually get bigger before staying the same or eventually fading on their own. Only in cases where there is underlying cancer is the situation very serious. If the tumour is successfully treated, the condition may disappear, but unfortunately the types of cancer that cause acanthosis nigricans tend to spread quickly and a cure is often not possible.

Many deaths could be prevented if first aid is given before emergency services arrive. What to do If someone is injured you should: first check that you and the casualty aren't in any danger, and, if possible, make the situation safe if necessary, dial 999 or 112 for an ambulance when it's safe to do so carry out basic first aid Read more about what to do after an incident. If someone is unconscious and breathing If a person is unconscious but breathing, and has no other injuries that would stop them being moved, place them in the recovery position until help arrives. Keep them under observation to ensure they continue to breathe normally, and don't obstruct their airway. If someone is unconscious and not breathing If a person isn't breathing normally after an incident, call an ambulance and start CPR straight away. Use hands-only CPR if you aren't trained to perform rescue breaths. Read more about CPR, including instructions and a video about hands-only CPR. Common accidents and emergencies Below, in alphabetical order, are some of the most common injuries that need emergency treatment in the UK and information about how to deal with them: anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) bleeding burns and scalds   choking  drowning  electric shock (domestic)  fractures  heart attack  poisoning  shock  stroke Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) is a severe allergic reaction that can occur after an insect sting or after eating certain foods. The adverse reaction can be very fast, occurring within seconds or minutes of coming into contact with the substance the person is allergic to (allergen). During anaphylactic shock, it may be difficult for the person to breathe, as their tongue and throat may swell, obstructing their airway. Call 999 or 112 immediately if you think someone is experiencing anaphylactic shock. Check if the person is carrying any medication. Some people who know they have severe allergies may carry an adrenaline self-injector, which is a type of pre-loaded syringe. You can either help the person administer their medication or, if you're trained to do so, give it to them yourself. After the injection, continue to look after the person until medical help arrives. All casualties who have had an intramuscular or subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of adrenaline must be seen and medically checked by a healthcare professional as soon as possible after the injection has been given. Make sure they're comfortable and can breathe as best they can while waiting for medical help to arrive. If they're conscious, sitting upright is normally the best position for them. Read more about treating anaphylaxis. Bleeding If someone is bleeding heavily, the main aim is to prevent further blood loss and minimise the effects of shock (see below). First, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance as soon as possible. If you have disposable gloves, use them to reduce the risk of any infection being passed on. Check that there's nothing embedded in the wound. If there is, take care not to press down on the object. Instead, press firmly on either side of the object and build up padding around it before bandaging, to avoid putting pressure on the object itself. If nothing is embedded: apply and maintain pressure to the wound with your gloved hand, using a clean pad or dressing if possible; continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops  use a clean dressing to bandage the wound firmly if bleeding continues through the pad, apply pressure to the wound  until the bleeding stops and then apply another pad over the top and bandage it in place; don't remove the original pad or dressing, but continue to check that the bleeding has stopped  If a body part, such as a finger, has been severed, place it in a plastic bag or wrap it in cling film and make sure it goes with the casualty to hospital. Always seek medical help for bleeding unless it's minor. If someone has a nosebleed that hasn't stopped after 20 minutes, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Read more about how to treat minor bleeding from cuts and grazes and how to treat nosebleeds. Haemostatic dressings and tourniquets In certain situations, where bleeding is very severe and from the body\u2019s extremities, such as the head, neck and torso, it may be appropriate to use haemostatic dressings or a tourniquet. Haemostatic dressings contain properties that help the blood to clot (thicken) quicker. A tourniquet is a band that's wrapped tightly around a limb to stop blood loss. Haemostatic dressings and tourniquets should only be used by people who have been trained to apply them. Burns and scalds If someone has a burn or scald: cool the burn as quickly as possible with cool running water for at least 10 minutes, or until the pain is relieved call 999 or seek medical help, if needed while cooling the burn, carefully remove any clothing or jewellery, unless it's attached to the skin if you're cooling a large burnt area, particularly in babies, children and elderly people, be aware that it may cause hypothermia (it may be necessary to stop cooling the burn to avoid hypothermia)  cover the burn loosely with cling film; if cling film isn't available, use a clean, dry dressing or non-fluffy material; don't wrap the burn tightly, because swelling may lead to further injury don't apply creams, lotions or sprays to the burn For chemical burns, wear protective gloves, remove any affected clothing, and rinse the burn with cool running water for at least 20 minutes to wash out the chemical. If possible, determine the cause of the injury. In certain situations where a chemical is regularly handled, a specific chemical antidote may be available to use. Be careful not to contaminate and injure yourself with the chemical, and wear protective clothing if necessary. Call 999 or 112 for immediate medical help. Read more about how to treat burns and scalds. Choking The information below is for choking in adults and children over one year old. Read what to do if a baby under one year old is choking. Mild choking If the airway is only partly blocked, the person will usually be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe. In situations like this, a person will usually be able to clear the blockage themselves. If choking is mild: encourage the person to cough to try to clear the blockage ask them to try to spit out the object if it\u2019s in their mouth don't put your fingers in their mouth to help them because they may accidentally bite you If coughing doesn\u2019t work, start back blows (see below). Severe choking  If choking is severe, the person won\u2019t be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe, and without help they\u2019ll eventually become unconscious. To help an adult or child over one year old: Stand behind the person and slightly to one side. Support their chest with one hand. Lean the person forward so that the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down. Give up to five sharp blows between the person\u2019s shoulder blades with the heel of your hand (the heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist). Check if the blockage has cleared. If not, give up to five abdominal thrusts (see below). Abdominal thrusts shouldn't be used on babies under one year old, pregnant women or obese people. To perform abdominal thrusts on a person who is severely choking and isn\u2019t in one of the above groups: Stand behind the person who is choking. Place your arms around their waist and bend them well forward. Clench one fist and place it just above the person's belly button. Place your other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards. Repeat this up to five times. The aim is to get the obstruction out with each chest thrust, rather than necessarily doing all five. If the obstruction doesn't clear after three cycles of back blows and chest thrusts, dial 999 or 112 to ask for an ambulance, and continue until help arrives. The person choking should always be seen by a healthcare professional afterwards to check for any injuries or small pieces of the obstruction that remain. Drowning If someone is in difficulty in water, don't enter the water to help unless it's absolutely essential. Once the person is on land, if they're not breathing, open the airway and give five initial rescue breaths before starting CPR. If you're alone, perform CPR for one minute before calling for emergency help. Find out how to give CPR, including rescue breaths. If the person is unconscious but still breathing, put them into the recovery position with their head lower than their body and call an ambulance immediately. Continue to observe the casualty to ensure they don't stop breathing or that their airway becomes obstructed. Electric shock (domestic) If someone has had an electric shock, switch off the electrical current at the mains to break the contact between the person and the electrical supply. If you can't reach the mains supply: don't go near or touch the person until you're sure the electrical supply has been switched off   once the power supply has been switched off, and if the person isn't breathing, dial 999 or 112 to for an ambulance Afterwards, seek medical help - unless the electric shock is very minor. Fractures It can be difficult to tell if a person has a broken bone or a joint, as opposed to a simple muscular injury. If you're in any doubt, treat the injury as a broken bone. If the person is unconscious, has difficulty breathing or is bleeding severely, these must be dealt with first, by controlling the bleeding with direct pressure and performing CPR. If the person is conscious, prevent any further pain or damage by keeping the fracture as still as possible until you get them safely to hospital. Assess the injury and decide whether the best way to get them to hospital is by ambulance or car. For example, if the pain isn\u2019t too severe, you could transport them to hospital by car. It's always best to get someone else to drive, so that you can deal with the casualty if they deteriorate \u2013 for example, if they lose consciousness as a result of the pain or start to vomit. However, if: they\u2019re in a lot of pain and in need of strong painkilling medication, don't move them and call an ambulance it's obvious they have a broken leg, don't move them, but keep them in the position you found them in and call an ambulance you suspect they have injured or broken their back, don't move them and call an ambulance Don't give the casualty anything to eat or drink, because they may need an anaesthetic (numbing medication) when they reach hospital. You can read more about specific broken bones in the following pages:  broken ankle broken arm or wrist broken collarbone broken nose broken toe fractured ribs hip fracture Heart attack A heart attack is one of the most common life-threatening heart conditions in the UK. If you think a person is having, or has had, a heart attack, sit them down and make them as comfortable as possible, and call 999 or 112 for an ambulance. Symptoms of a heart attack include: chest pain \u2013 the pain is usually located in the centre or left side of the chest and can feel like a sensation of pressure, tightness or squeezing pain in other parts of the body \u2013 it can feel as if the pain is travelling from the chest down one or both arms, or into the jaw, neck, back or abdomen (tummy)  Sit the person down and make them comfortable. If they're conscious, reassure them and ask them to take a 300mg aspirin tablet to chew slowly (unless you know they shouldn't take aspirin \u2013 for example, if they're under 16 or allergic to it). If the person has any medication for angina, such as a spray or tablets, help them to take it. Monitor their vital signs, such as breathing, until help arrives. If the person deteriorates and becomes unconscious, open their airway, check their breathing and, if necessary, start CPR. Re-alert the emergency services that the casualty is now in cardiac arrest. Poisoning Poisoning is potentially life-threatening. Most cases of poisoning in the UK happen when a person has swallowed a toxic substance, such as bleach, taken an overdose of a prescription medication, or eaten wild plants and fungi. Alcohol poisoning can cause similar symptoms. If you think someone has swallowed a poisonous substance, call 999 or 112 to get immediate medical help and advice. The effects of poisoning depend on the substance swallowed, but can include vomiting, loss of consciousness, pain or a burning sensation. The following advice is important: Find out what's been swallowed, so you can tell the paramedic or doctor. Do not give the person anything to eat or drink unless a healthcare professional advises you to. Do not try to cause vomiting. Stay with the person, because their condition may get worse and they could become unconscious. If the person becomes unconscious while you're waiting for help to arrive, check for breathing and, if necessary, perform CPR. Don't perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if the casualty's mouth or airway is contaminated with the poison. Don't leave them if they're unconscious because they may roll onto their back, which could cause them to vomit. The vomit could then enter their lungs and make them choke. If the casualty is conscious and breathing normally, put them into the recovery position and continue to monitor their conscious state and breathing. Read more about treating someone who's been poisoned and treating alcohol poisoning. Shock In the case of a serious injury or illness, it's important to look out for signs of shock (see below). Shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the circulatory system fails to provide enough oxygenated blood to the body and, as a result, deprives the vital organs of oxygen. This is usually due to severe blood loss, but it can also occur after severe burns, severe vomiting, a heart attack, bacterial infection or a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). The type of shock described here isn't the same as the emotional response of feeling shocked, which can also occur after an accident. Signs of shock include: pale, cold, clammy skin sweating rapid, shallow breathing weakness and dizziness feeling sick and possibly vomiting thirst yawning sighing Seek medical help immediately if you notice that someone has any of the above signs of shock. If they do, you should: dial 999 or 112 as soon as possible and ask for an ambulance treat any obvious injuries lie the person down if their injuries allow you to and, if possible, raise and support their legs use a coat or blanket to keep them warm don't give them anything to eat or drink give them lots of comfort and reassurance monitor the person \u2013 if they stop breathing, start CPR and re-alert the emergency services Stroke The FAST guide is the most important thing to remember when dealing with people who have had a stroke. The earlier they receive treatment, the better. Call for emergency medical help straight away. If you think a person has had a stroke, use the FAST guide: Facial weakness \u2013 is the person unable to smile evenly, or are their eyes or mouth droopy? Arm weakness \u2013 is the person only able to raise one arm? Speech problems \u2013 is the person unable to speak clearly or understand you? Time to call 999 or 112 \u2013 for emergency help if a person has any of these symptoms Read more about the symptoms of a stroke. Getting help in an emergency In the UK, 999 has been the emergency services number for many years. However, you can now also call 112 to get help, which is the single emergency telephone number for the EU. This number will give you access to the emergency services wherever you are in the EU. When you call 999 or 112, you'll be asked what service you need, as well as: your telephone number the address you're calling from  a brief description of what's wrong with the casualty and whether they're bleeding, unconscious or not breathing The call handler may advise you on how to assist the casualty until help arrives.

The valve at the end of the gullet also fails to open and allow food to pass into your stomach. As a result, food gets stuck in your gullet and is often brought back up. A ring of muscle called the lower oesophageal (cardiac) sphincter keeps the opening from the gullet to the stomach shut tight to prevent acid reflux (acidic stomach content moving back up into the gullet). Normally, this muscle relaxes when you swallow to allow the food to pass into your stomach. In achalasia, this muscle does not relax properly and the end of your gullet becomes blocked with food. Achalasia is an uncommon condition that affects about 6,000 people in Britain. It is sometimes known as cardiospasm. What are the symptoms? Symptoms of achalasia may start at any time of life and usually come on gradually. Most people with achalasia have dysphagia, a condition where they find it difficult and sometimes painful to swallow food. This tends to get worse over a couple of years. It may cause you to bring back up undigested food shortly after meals and some of the vomited food may have been held up in your gullet for some time. Bringing up undigested food can lead to choking and coughing fits, chest pain and heartburn. Occasionally, vomit may dribble out of your mouth and stain the pillow during the night. If it trickles down your windpipe, it can cause repeated chest infections and even pneumonia. You may experience gradual but significant weight loss. However, in some people achalasia causes no symptoms and is only discovered when a chest X-ray or other investigation is performed for another reason. What is the cause? Achalasia is caused by damage to and loss of the nerves in the gullet wall. The reason for this is unknown, although a viral infection earlier in life may be partly responsible. Achalasia may also be associated with having an autoimmune condition, where the immune system attacks healthy cells, tissue and organs. One recent study found people with achalasia are significantly more likely to have an autoimmune condition such as Sjogren's syndrome, lupus or uveitis. Although achalasia can occur at any age, it is more common in middle-aged or older adults. There is no evidence to suggest that achalasia is an inherited illness. Women with achalasia can have a normal pregnancy and there's no reason why their children will not develop normally. How is it diagnosed? If your GP thinks you have achalasia, you will be referred to hospital to have some diagnostic tests performed. Barium swallow A barium swallow involves drinking a white liquid containing the chemical barium, which allows the gullet to be seen and videoed on an X-ray. In achalasia, the exit at the lower end of your gullet never opens properly, which causes a delay in barium passing into your stomach. An ordinary chest X-ray may show a wide gullet. Endoscopy A flexible instrument called an endoscope is passed down your throat to allow the doctor to look directly at the lining of your gullet and stomach. Trapped food will be visible. The endoscope can be passed through the tight muscle at the bottom of your gullet and into your stomach to check there is no other disorder of the stomach. Read more about having an endoscopy. Manometry Manometry measures pressure waves in your gullet. A small plastic tube is passed into your gullet through your mouth or nose and the pressure at different points in your gullet is measured. In achalasia, there are usually weak or absent contractions of the gullet and sustained high pressure in the muscle at the lower end of the gullet. The high pressure means the muscle does not relax in response to swallowing, causing symptoms of achalasia. How is it treated? The aim of treatment is to open the lower oesophageal sphincter muscle so food can pass into the stomach easily. The underlying disease cannot be cured but there are various ways to relieve symptoms which can improve swallowing and eating. Medication The muscle at the lower end of your gullet may be temporarily relaxed by medication. Tablets such as nitrates or nifedipine can sometimes produce a brief improvement in swallowing but are not effective in all patients. They can be helpful while a more permanent treatment is planned. These tablets may cause headaches, but this usually improves with continued treatment. Dilatation (stretching the muscle) This is done under a sedative or general anaesthetic (where you are put to sleep). A balloon (about 3-4cm in diameter) is used to stretch and disrupt the muscle fibres of the sphincter muscle at the lower end of your gullet. This usually improves swallowing but may need to be performed several times or repeated after one or more years. Balloon dilatation does carry the risk of oesophageal rupture which may require emergency surgery. Botulinum toxin (Botox injection) Botox causes relaxation of the muscle fibres. It can be injected painlessly into the lower oesophageal sphincter muscle through an endoscope. This is usually effective for a few months and occasionally for a few years, but has to be repeated. Botox can be used for temporary relief in people who are not able to have other treatments. Surgery Under general anaesthetic the gullet is accessed through the abdomen (tummy) or, rarely, the chest. The muscle fibres of the lower oesophageal sphincter that fail to relax are divided. This usually leads to a permanent improvement in swallowing. The operation is now performed by keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) and only requires an overnight stay in hospital. Recovering from treatment There are a few things you can do after dilatation or surgery to reduce symptoms: chew your food well take your time eating drink plenty of fluids with your meals always eat food sitting upright use several pillows or raise the head of your bed so that you sleep fairly upright, which prevents stomach acid rising into your gullet through the weakened valve and causing heartburn If heartburn develops after treatment, consult your GP as medication may be needed to reduce the acid reflux. Sometimes your surgeon may suggest you take this routinely to prevent problems after surgery. Read about treatments for acid reflux. You should also see your GP if you still have swallowing difficulties or are continuing to lose weight. It's normal for chest pain to persist for a while after treatment \u2013 drinking cold water often gives relief. Cancer risk If the gullet contains a large amount of food that does not pass into the stomach in the normal way, the risk of cancer of the oesophagus (gullet) is slightly increased. The increased risk is likely to be most significant in long-term untreated achalasia. It's therefore important to get appropriate treatment for achalasia straight away, even if your symptoms are not bothering you. According to Cancer Research UK, compared with the general population: men with achalasia have an eight to 16 times higher risk of oesophageal cancer women with achalasia have a 20 times higher risk of one particular type of oesophageal cancer (adenocarcinoma) However, cancer of the oesophagus is very uncommon and although your risk is slightly increased, it remains highly unlikely.

They're available over the counter from pharmacies and are often used to treat the symptoms of heartburn and indigestion. How antacids work Antacids counteract (neutralise) the acid in your stomach that's used to aid digestion. This helps reduce the symptoms of heartburn and relieves pain. Some antacids also coat the surface of the oesophagus (gullet) with a protective barrier against stomach acid, or produce a gel on the stomach\u2019s surface which helps stop acid leaking into the oesophagus and causing acid reflux. Different types of antacids Antacids are available in liquid form or as chewable tablets. They're sold under various brand names but contain common ingredients, including: aluminium hydroxide magnesium carbonate magnesium trisilicate Extra ingredients are sometimes added to help treat other problems, such as simeticone to relieve flatulence (wind), and alginates to prevent acid flowing into your oesophagus. Who can't take antacids? Antacids aren't suitable for everyone. For example, many antacids aren't recommended for children under the age of 12 and people with certain health conditions, such as kidney disease. Antacids can also interfere with other medications, so you may not be able to take them while you're being treated for another condition. Antacids are generally considered safe to take during pregnancy, but you should discuss it with your GP or pharmacist beforehand. Read more about who can't take antacid medicines. Possible side effects of antacids Like all medicines, antacids can have side effects. Common side effects include: diarrhoea constipation flatulence stomach cramps feeling sick or vomiting If you have diarrhoea or constipation after taking antacids it may be possible to switch to an alternative medicine. Speak to your GP or pharmacist for advice. Any side effects you experience while taking antacids should pass once you stop taking the medication. Visit your GP if they continue. Missed or extra doses When taking antacid medicines, follow the instructions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine or the advice of your GP or pharmacist. If you miss a dose, it won't usually be necessary to alter your next dose. It's likely that you can carry on taking your normal dose. However, for specific advice about what to do, refer to the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. Taking extra doses could cause several unpleasant side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation. Contact your GP or pharmacist immediately if you think that you've taken more antacids than you should have. Alternatively, you can call NHS 111 for advice.

It causes spots, oily skin and sometimes skin that's hot or painful to touch. Acne most commonly develops on the: face \u2013 this affects almost everyone with acne back \u2013 this affects more than half of people with acne chest \u2013 this affects about 15% of people with acne Types of spots There are six main types of spot caused by acne: blackheads \u2013 small black or yellowish bumps that develop on the skin; they're not filled with dirt, but are black because the inner lining of the hair follicle produces pigmentation (colouring) whiteheads \u2013 have a similar appearance to blackheads, but may be firmer and won't empty when squeezed papules \u2013 small red bumps that may feel tender or sore pustules \u2013 similar to papules, but have a white tip in the centre, caused by a build-up of pus nodules \u2013 large hard lumps that build up beneath the surface of the skin and can be painful cysts \u2013 the most severe type of spot caused by acne; they're large pus-filled lumps that look similar to boils and carry the greatest risk of causing permanent scarring What can I do if I have acne? The self-help techniques below may be useful: Don't wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Frequent washing can irritate the skin and make symptoms worse. Wash the affected area with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse. Don't try to \"clean out\" blackheads or squeeze spots. This can make them worse and cause permanent scarring. Avoid using too much make-up and cosmetics. Use water-based products that are described as non-comedogenic (this means the product is less likely to block the pores in your skin). Completely remove make-up before going to bed. If dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free, water-based emollient. Regular exercise can't improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem. Shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising, as sweat can irritate your acne. Wash your hair regularly and try to avoid letting your hair fall across your face. Although acne can't be cured, it can be controlled with treatment. Several creams, lotions and gels for treating spots are available at pharmacies. If you develop acne, it's a good idea to speak to your pharmacist for advice. Products containing a low concentration of benzoyl peroxide may be recommended \u2013 but be careful, as this can bleach clothing. If your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back, it may need to be treated with antibiotics or stronger creams that are only available on prescription. When to seek medical advice Even mild cases of acne can cause distress. If your acne is making you feel very unhappy or you can't control your spots with over-the-counter medication, see your GP. Also see your GP if you develop nodules or cysts, as they need to be treated properly to avoid scarring. Try to resist the temptation to pick or squeeze the spots, as this can lead to permanent scarring. Treatments can take up to three months to work, so don't expect results overnight. Once they do start to work, the results are usually good. Read more about: diagnosing acne treating acne complications of acne Why do I have acne? Acne is most commonly linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age. Certain hormones cause the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum). This abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus. The hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores (opening of the hair follicles). Cleaning the skin doesn't help to remove this blockage. Other possible causes Acne is known to run in families. If both your mother and father had acne, it's likely that you'll also have acne. Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women. There's no evidence that diet, poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne. Read more about the causes of acne, including some common acne myths. Who's affected? Acne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. About 80% of people aged 11 to 30 are affected by acne. Acne is most common in girls from the ages of 14 to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16 to 19. Most people have acne on and off for several years before their symptoms start to improve as they get older. Acne often disappears when a person is in their mid-twenties. In some cases, acne can continue into adult life. About 5% of women and 1% of men have acne over the age of 25.

It's also known as a vestibular schwannoma. A benign brain tumour is a growth in the brain that usually grows slowly over many years and doesn't spread to other parts of the body. Acoustic neuromas grow on the nerve used for hearing and balance, which can cause problems such as hearing loss and unsteadiness. They can sometimes be serious if they become very large, but most are picked up and treated before they reach this stage. Acoustic neuromas tend to affect adults aged 30-60 and usually have no obvious cause, although a small number of cases are the result of a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). This page covers: Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma Getting medical advice Treatments for acoustic neuromas Outlook for acoustic neuromas Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma An acoustic neuroma may not cause any obvious symptoms at first. Any symptoms tend to develop gradually and often include: hearing loss, which usually only affects one ear tinnitus (hearing sounds that come from inside the body) vertigo (the sensation that you're moving or spinning) A large acoustic neuroma can also sometimes cause: persistent headaches temporary blurred or double vision numbness, pain or weakness on one side of the face problems with limb co-ordination (ataxia) on one side of the body a hoarse voice or difficulty swallowing Getting medical advice See your GP if you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you're worried could be caused by an acoustic neuroma. Acoustic neuromas can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms can be caused by other conditions, such as Ménière's disease. If your GP thinks you could have an acoustic neuroma, you'll be referred to a hospital or clinic for further tests, such as: hearing tests to check for hearing problems and determine whether they're caused by a problem with your nerves a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed picture of the inside of your head a computerised tomography (CT) scan, which uses a series of X-rays to create a detailed image of the inside of your head Treatments for acoustic neuromas There are several different treatment options for an acoustic neuroma, depending on the size and position of your tumour, how fast it's growing and your general health. The main options are: monitoring the tumour \u2013 small tumours often just need to be monitored with regular MRI scans, and the treatments below are generally only recommended if scans show it's getting bigger brain surgery \u2013 surgery to remove the tumour through a cut in the skull may be carried out under general anaesthetic if it's large or getting bigger stereotactic radiosurgery \u2013 small tumours, or any pieces of a larger tumour that remain after surgery, may be treated with a precise beam of radiation to stop them getting any bigger All these options carry some risks. For example, surgery and radiosurgery can sometimes cause facial numbness or paralysis (an inability to move part of your face). Speak to your specialist about the best option for you and what the benefits and risks are. Outlook for acoustic neuromas Large acoustic neuromas can be serious because they can sometimes cause a life-threatening build-up of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). However, it's rare for them to reach this stage. Many grow very slowly or not at all, and those that grow more quickly can be treated before they become too big. Even with treatment, symptoms such as hearing loss and tinnitus can persist and affect your ability to work, communicate and\/or drive. These problems may need additional treatment \u2013 read more about treating hearing loss and treating tinnitus. An acoustic neuroma can occasionally return after treatment. This is thought to happen to around 1 in every 20 people who have had surgical removal. You will probably continue having regular MRI scans after any treatment, to check if the tumour is growing again or coming back. Information about you If you have an acoustic neuroma, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Typical features include: abnormally large hands and feet large, prominent facial features an enlarged tongue abnormally tall height (if it occurs before puberty)  Growth hormone is produced and released by the pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland just below the brain. When growth hormone is released into the blood, it stimulates the liver to produce another hormone \u2013 insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) \u2013 which causes growth of muscle, bones and cartilage throughout the body. This process is essential for growth and repair of body tissues. What happens in people with acromegaly? Acromegaly is caused by excessive production of growth hormone. This usually occurs as the result of a benign (non-cancerous) brain tumour in the pituitary gland called an adenoma, but rare cases have been linked to tumours elsewhere in the body, such as in the lungs and pancreas. Although acromegaly does very occasionally run in families, most adenomas are not inherited \u2013 they usually develop spontaneously as a result of a genetic change within a cell of the pituitary gland. This genetic change switches on a signal that tells cells in the pituitary gland to divide and secrete growth hormone. The tumour almost never spreads to other parts of the body, but it may grow to more than 1cm in size and compress the surrounding nerves and normal pituitary tissue, which can affect the production of other hormones, such as thyroid hormones released from the thyroid gland. Who is affected It's not clear exactly how many people are affected by acromegaly, although it's been estimated that around 4 to 13 in every 100,000 people may have the condition. This means there is likely to be between 2,500 and 8,300 people in the UK with the condition. Acromegaly can affect people of any age, but it is rare in children. The average age at which people are diagnosed is around 40-45. Problems caused by acromegaly  Acromegaly can cause a wide range of symptoms that tend to develop slowly over time. Typical symptoms include: joint pain   large hands and feet carpal tunnel syndrome (compression of the nerve in the wrist, causing numbness and weakness of the hands) thick, coarse, oily skin skin tags enlarged lips, tongue and nose a protruding jaw and brow widely spaced teeth deepening of the voice due to enlarged sinuses and vocal cords obstructive sleep apnoea (breaks in breathing during sleep due to obstruction of the airway) excessive sweating fatigue and weakness headaches impaired vision  loss of sex drive  in women, abnormal periods in men, erectile dysfunction in children and teenagers, excessive height (gigantism) Some of the above symptoms are the result of the tumour compressing nearby tissues \u2013 for example, headaches and vision problems may occur if the tumour squashes nearby nerves. If you think you have acromegaly, see your GP straight away. Acromegaly can usually be successfully treated with brain surgery and medication, but early diagnosis and treatment is important to prevent the symptoms getting worse and to reduce your chance of getting complications. Possible complications If acromegaly is left untreated, you may be at risk of the following health problems: type 2 diabetes  high blood pressure (hypertension) cardiovascular disease cardiomyopathy (a disease of the heart muscle) arthritis as a result of overgrowth of bone and cartilage bowel polyps, which can potentially turn into bowel cancer if left untreated Left untreated, these complications can become serious and fatal. Diagnosing acromegaly Blood tests If your doctor suspects acromegaly from your symptoms, they will order blood tests to measure your levels of human growth hormone. Levels of growth hormone naturally vary from minute to minute as it is released from the pituitary gland in spurts. Therefore to accurately diagnose acromegaly, growth hormone needs to be measured under conditions that normally suppress growth hormone secretion. To ensure an accurate result, you may be referred to a hospital doctor for a glucose tolerance test. This involves testing your blood after drinking a solution or drink containing the sugar glucose. In most people, drinking the glucose solution will suppress the release of growth hormone, but in people with acromegaly, the level of growth hormone in the blood will remain elevated. Your doctor will also measure your level of IGF-1, which should increase with the level of growth hormone. An elevated IGF-1 level almost always indicates acromegaly.  Brain scans You may then have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your brain to locate and define the size of the pituitary gland tumour causing your acromegaly.  A computerised tomography (CT) scan can be carried out if you are unable to have an MRI scan. Treating acromegaly Treatment aims to: reduce excess growth hormone to normal levels relieve the pressure the tumour is exerting on the surrounding structures treat any hormone deficiencies improve the symptoms of acromegaly This is usually achieved through surgical removal of the tumour and medication. Brain surgery In most cases, surgery is recommended to remove the adenoma from your pituitary gland. This is effective in most people, although sometimes the tumour is too large to be removed completely. Under a general anaesthetic, the surgeon will make an incision inside your nose or behind your upper lip to access the gland. An endoscope (a long, thin, flexible tube that has a light source and a video camera at one end) and surgical instruments are then passed through the incisions to remove the tumour. Removing the tumour promptly relieves the pressure on the surrounding structures and leads to a rapid lowering of growth hormone levels. Facial appearance and swelling often improve within a few days. Possible complications of surgery include damage to the healthy parts of the pituitary gland, leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (which surrounds and protects the brain), and  meningitis, though this is rare. Your surgeon will discuss these risks with you and answer any questions you have. Medication The following medications may be used after surgery, or when surgery is not possible: Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine or cabergoline \u2013 these are taken by mouth (orally) once or twice a week and can suppress growth hormone production, although they only work in a small proportion of people. Somatostatin analogues, such as octreotide or lanreotide \u2013 these are generally given by an injection into the muscle or under the skin once a month. They can control growth hormone release and lead to tumour shrinkage in some people. Pegvisomant \u2013 this is given once a day by injection and it directly blocks the effects of growth hormone and can improve symptoms. It lowers IGF-1 but not growth hormone levels. Each of these medications has different advantages and disadvantages. Speak to your doctor about the options available to you and the benefits and risks of each option. Radiotherapy If surgery is not possible, or surgery and medication do not cure the condition, radiotherapy aimed at the adenoma may be an option. This can eventually lead to a reduction in growth hormone levels, although it may not have a noticeable effect for several years and you may need to take medication in the meantime. There are two main types of radiotherapy for acromegaly: Stereotactic radiosurgery \u2013 where a high-dose beam of radiation is precisely aimed at the tumour, requiring you to wear a rigid head frame to keep your head still. This can sometimes be done in a single session. Conventional radiotherapy \u2013 where the tumour is targeted with external beams. This can potentially damage the surrounding pituitary gland and brain tissue, so small doses of radiation are given over four to six weeks, giving normal tissue time to heal in between treatments. Stereotactic radiosurgery is generally preferred to conventional radiotherapy because it minimises the risk of damage to nearby healthy tissue, although it is not always widely available. Radiotherapy can have a number of side effects. For example, the treatment will often cause a gradual decline in the production of other hormones from your pituitary gland, so you'll usually need to take hormone replacement therapy for the rest of your life. There's also a risk it will impair fertility. Speak to your doctor about the risks involved. Bowel cancer screening There is some evidence acromegaly may increase your risk of bowel cancer, so guidelines recommend having a colonoscopy when you are diagnosed with the condition, and regular colonoscopy screening from the age of 40. A colonoscopy is an examination of your entire large bowel using a type of endoscope called a colonoscope that is inserted into your bottom. See bowel cancer tests for more information about what a colonoscopy involves. Outlook Treatment is often effective at stopping the excessive production of growth hormone and improving problems caused by the condition. Treatment can also increase life expectancy to around that of someone without acromegaly. Some treatments can take a long time to have a noticeable effect and you may need to take medication for a long period of time. After treatment, you'll need regular follow-up appointments with your specialist for the rest of your life. These will be used to monitor your pituitary function, check you are on the correct hormone replacement treatment, and to ensure the condition does not return. Without treatment, acromegaly can cause long-term problems and may reduce life expectancy by a number of years.

The patches can be pink, red or brown in colour, and can vary in size from a few millimetres to a few centimetres across. The skin in affected areas can sometimes become very thick, and occasionally the patches can look like small horns or spikes. Actinic keratoses are found on areas of skin that are exposed to the sun, such as the: face, especially the nose and forehead forearms and backs of hands in men, on the rims of the ears and bald scalps in women, on the legs below the knees The patches are usually harmless and sometimes get better on their own, but they can be sore, itchy and look unsightly. There is also a small risk that the patches could develop into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma if they're not treated. You should see your GP if you think you may have actinic keratoses, so they can discuss treatment options with you. Who is affected Actinic keratoses are most commonly seen in fair-skinned people, especially those with blue eyes, red hair, freckles and a tendency to burn easily in the sun. Men are affected more often than women. People who have lived or worked abroad in a sunny place, or who have worked outdoors or enjoy outdoor hobbies, are most at risk. It may take many years before actinic keratoses develop \u2013 they don't usually appear before the age of 40. Studies carried out in the UK have suggested that around one in every four or five people over the age of 60 has actinic keratoses. Diagnosing actinic keratoses Your GP may be able to diagnose actinic keratoses by examining the patches on your skin. In some cases, the diagnosis may need to be confirmed by removing a small sample of skin and examining it under the microscope. Actinic keratoses can often be managed by your GP, but you may need to see a skin specialist (dermatologist) for further assessment if: your GP is not certain about your diagnosis your GP thinks one or more of your patches may be cancerous or at a high risk of becoming cancerous your patches are particularly severe or widespread you are taking immunosuppressant drugs \u2013 for example, following an organ transplant your patches have not responded to treatment Treatment options If the patches are not troublesome, your doctor may simply recommend that you keep an eye on them and come back if they change in any way \u2013 for example, if you develop new symptoms such as a patch growing quickly, bleeding or forming an ulcer. However, actinic keratoses are often removed because of concerns they may develop into skin cancer (see below) or, less commonly, for cosmetic reasons. The patches can be removed using a variety of treatments, depending on your individual circumstances. The main treatments used are summarised below. Creams or gels There are a number of creams and gels that can be applied to the skin if you have several patches. Commonly used treatments include 5-fluorouracil cream, imiquimod cream, diclofenac gel and ingenol mebutate gel. These creams and gels are usually applied daily (washing your hands carefully after), often for several weeks, and they cause the abnormal skin cells to die. They may make the skin sore, and it may weep and blister after a few days of treatment.  The various creams and gels seem to be similarly effective in treating actinic keratoses, although the potential side effects and the length of time that treatment is needed differs between each of them. Not all are easily available. Discuss the benefits and risks of the different creams and gels available with your GP before starting treatment. Freezing with liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy) In some cases, freezing the patches (cryotherapy) may be recommended. This causes blistering and shedding of the sun-damaged areas of skin.  The time it takes the skin to heal varies, depending on the areas of the body treated. Some areas may heal in a week or two, whereas others may take a few months to fully heal. A light freeze usually leaves no scar, but thicker lesions or early skin cancer may need longer freezes, which can leave a permanently pale or dark mark. Scraping (curettage)  Curettage is where the abnormal patches are scraped off with a sharp spoon-like instrument called a curette. This procedure is done under a local anaesthetic (where the treated area is numbed) and is generally used to treat thicker patches and early skin cancers, or to help confirm a diagnosis. Cautery (heat treatment) is used to stop any bleeding after the cells have been removed. A scab forms after the procedure, which heals over a few weeks to leave a small scar. The scrapings that are removed can be examined under the microscope to confirm the diagnosis. Cutting it out (excision)  If your doctor suspects the patch may be cancerous or pre-cancerous, they may cut it out using a scalpel under local anaesthetic and close the wound with stitches. The piece of skin is then examined under the microscope to confirm the diagnosis. Removing the patch will leave a permanent scar. Other treatments There are also a number of other treatments that may be effective in treating actinic keratoses, including: photodynamic therapy (PDT) \u2013 where light is shone onto the affected area of skin after a light-activated cream has been applied; the light activates this cream and causes it to form a chemical that kills the abnormal cells laser resurfacing \u2013 where a laser beam is used to remove the abnormal patches of skin dermabrasion \u2013 where specially-designed abrasive instruments are used to remove the abnormal patches chemical peels \u2013 where a corrosive liquid is applied to the affected area of skin to remove the abnormal patches However, these treatments are not in widespread use and there is no clear evidence that they offer any additional benefit. Self-help It is important to protect your skin from the sun if you have actinic keratoses. This can reduce the risk of further patches developing and may help reduce the number of patches you already have. To protect yourself from the sun, you should: apply sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 before exposing yourself to direct sunlight cover up your skin with clothes and a hat during the summer months try to avoid direct exposure to the sun when it is at its strongest (between 11am and 3pm) It may also be helpful to regularly use emollients on your skin to stop it becoming dry. Outlook Actinic keratoses that have been treated usually go away, but it is likely that more patches will develop, requiring further treatment.  The development of actinic keratoses is a sign that the underlying skin is damaged from many years of sun exposure, and this cannot be reversed. It means you have a higher than average risk of developing skin cancer. However, the exact chances of actinic keratoses developing into skin cancer are not clear. Some research has suggested the chances of a patch becoming cancerous are less than 1 in 1,000 every year, whereas other studies suggest the overall chances of actinic keratoses becoming cancerous may be as high as 1 in 10.

Most bacterial infections are confined to one part of the body because the bacteria are unable to penetrate the body's tissue. However, actinomycosis is unusual in that the infection is able to move slowly but steadily through body tissue. Symptoms of actinomycosis vary depending on the type of infection, but can include: swelling and inflammation of affected tissue tissue damage that results in scar tissue formation of abscesses (pus-filled swellings) small holes or tunnels that develop in tissue and leak a type of lumpy pus Read more about the symptoms of actinomycosis. Types of actinomycosis In theory, actinomycosis can develop almost anywhere inside the tissue of the human body. But the condition tends to affect certain areas of the body and can be classified into four main types. They are: oral cervicofacial actinomycosis thoracic actinomycosis abdominal actinomycosis pelvic actinomycosis These are described below. Oral cervicofacial actinomycosis Oral cervicofacial actinomycosis is where the infection develops inside the neck, jaw or mouth. In the past, if the condition developed in the jaw it was known as lumpy jaw. Most cases of oral cervicofacial actinomycosis are caused by dental problems, such as tooth decay or a jaw injury. Oral cervicofacial actinomycosis is the most common type of actinomycosis, accounting for 50-70% of all cases. Thoracic actinomycosis Thoracic actinomycosis is where the infection develops inside the lungs or associated airways. Most cases of thoracic actinomycosis are thought to be caused by people accidentally inhaling droplets of contaminated fluid into their lungs. Thoracic actinomycosis accounts for an estimated 15-20% of cases. Abdominal actinomycosis Abdominal actinomycosis is where the infection develops inside the abdomen (tummy). This type of actinomycosis can have a range of potential causes. It can develop as a secondary complication of a more common infection, such as appendicitis, or after accidentally swallowing a foreign object, such as a chicken bone. Abdominal actinomycosis accounts for an estimated 20% of all cases. Pelvic actinomycosis Pelvic actinomycosis is where the infection develops inside the pelvis. It usually only occurs in women because most cases are caused when the actinomyces bacteria are spread from the female genitals into the pelvis. Most cases of pelvic actinomycosis are thought to be associated with the long-term use of an intrauterine device (IUD). This type of contraceptive is often known as the coil. Pelvic actinomycosis usually only occurs if the coil is left in for longer than the manufacturer recommends. Pelvic actinomycosis accounts for an estimated 10% of all cases. What causes actinomycosis? Actinomycosis is caused by a family of bacteria known as actinomycetaceae. In most cases, the bacteria live harmlessly on the lining of the mouth, throat, digestive system and vagina (in women). The bacteria only pose a problem if the tissue lining becomes damaged by injury or disease, allowing the bacteria to penetrate deeper into the body. This is potentially serious because these are anaerobic bacteria, which means they thrive in parts of the body where there isn't much oxygen, such as deep inside body tissues. However, an advantage of actinomyces bacteria being anaerobic is that they can't survive outside the human body. This means that actinomycosis isn't a contagious condition. Read more about the causes of actinomycosis. Diagnosing actinomycosis In its initial stages, actinomycosis can be a challenging condition to diagnose correctly because it shares symptoms with other more common conditions. It's often only discovered during tests or surgery to check for other conditions. For example, many cases of actinomycosis are detected when biopsies are carried out to check for cancer. A biopsy is where a small tissue sample is removed so it can be examined under a microscope. Actinomycosis can usually be more confidently diagnosed in its later stages, after the sinus tracts have appeared in the surface of the skin. This is because the sulphur granules produced by the sinus tracts during an actinomycosis infection have a distinctive shape that can be identified under a microscope. Treating actinomycosis Actinomycosis usually responds well to treatment, which involves taking a long-term course of antibiotics. Antibiotics An initial course of antibiotic injections is usually recommended for 2 to 6 weeks, followed by antibiotic tablets for another 6 to 12 months. A nurse should be able to teach you how to administer antibiotic injections at home so you don't need to stay in hospital for the duration of the course. The preferred antibiotics for treating actinomycosis are benzylpenicillin, which is used for the antibiotic injections, and amoxicillin tablets. In some cases, other bacteria are also present and more than one antibiotic or other antibiotics will need to be given. Side effects of these antibiotics include: diarrhoea  nausea (feeling sick) skin rash increased vulnerability to fungal infections, such as oral thrush (a fungal infection that occurs in the mouth) If you're allergic to penicillin, alternative antibiotics such as tetracycline or erythromycin can be used. Read more about antibiotics. Surgery In some cases, minor surgery may be required to repair the damaged tissue and drain pus out of the abscesses. Complications of actinomycosis Abscesses that develop as a result of actinomycosis may form in many parts of your body, including your lungs. They can spread easily from one part of your body to another. If the original site of the infection is located in the skin of your face, it may spread to nearby parts of your body, such as your scalp or ears. If the original site of the infection is your mouth, it may spread to your tongue, larynx (voicebox), trachea (windpipe) and salivary glands, and the tubes that connect your throat to your nose. If the infection spreads to your brain, a brain abscess could develop. Preventing actinomycosis Most cases of oral actinomycosis occur as a result of poor dental hygiene. This means practising good dental hygiene is the best way to prevent actinomycosis. Read about preventing tooth decay and dental health for more information and advice about good oral hygiene practices.

In developed countries, such as England, it's thought just 1 in 300,000 people will develop actinomycosis in any given year. On average, there are 100 admissions to hospital each year in England because of actinomycosis.

It is often seen as a form of complementary or alternative medicine (CAM), although it is used in many NHS general practices, as well as the majority of pain clinics and hospices in the UK. Theory Western medical acupuncture is the use of acupuncture after a proper medical diagnosis. It is based on scientific evidence that shows the treatment can stimulate nerves under the skin and in muscle tissue. This results in the body producing pain-relieving substances, such as endorphins. It is likely these substances are responsible for any beneficial effects seen with this form of acupuncture. Traditional acupuncture is based on the belief that an energy, or \"life force\", flows through the body in channels called meridians. This life force is known as Qi (pronounced \"chee\"). Practitioners who adhere to traditional beliefs about acupuncture believe that when Qi does not flow freely through the body, this can cause illness. They also believe acupuncture can restore the flow of Qi, and so restore health. Read more about what happens during acupuncture. What is it used for? Acupuncture practitioners \u2013 sometimes called acupuncturists \u2013 use acupuncture to treat a wide range of health conditions. It is often used to treat pain conditions such as headache, lower back pain and osteoarthritis, but is also sometimes used in an attempt to help people with conditions ranging from infertility to anxiety and asthma. Acupuncture is occasionally available on the NHS, although access is limited. Most acupuncture patients pay for private treatment. Read more about the common uses of acupuncture. Does it work? Currently, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) only recommends considering acupuncture as a treatment option for chronic lower back pain, chronic tension-type headaches and migraines. NICE makes these recommendations on the basis of scientific evidence. There is also some evidence that acupuncture works for a small number of other problems, including neck pain and post-chemotherapy nausea and vomiting. Acupuncture is sometimes used for a variety of other conditions as well, but the evidence is not conclusive for many of these uses. Read more about the evidence for and against acupuncture. Having acupuncture When it is carried out by a qualified practitioner, acupuncture is generally very safe. Some people experience side effects such as feeling drowsy or dizzy, but these are usually mild and short-lived. If you choose to have acupuncture, make sure your acupuncture practitioner is either a regulated healthcare professional or a member of a recognised national acupuncture organisation. Read more about acupuncture safety and regulation. Acupuncture on the NHS Acupuncture is sometimes available on the NHS, most often from GPs or physiotherapists, although access is limited. Most acupuncture patients pay for private treatment. The cost of acupuncture varies widely between practitioners. Initial sessions usually cost between £35 and £60, and further sessions between £30 and £50.  Page last reviewed: 15\/07\/2014 Next review due: 15\/07\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It usually occurs when a gallstone blocks the cystic duct. Gallstones are small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder. The cystic duct is the main opening of the gallbladder. Gallstones are very common, affecting about 1 in 10 adults in the UK. They don't usually cause symptoms, but they can occasionally cause episodes of pain (biliary colic) or acute cholecystitis. Acute cholecystitis is potentially serious. It usually needs to be treated in hospital with rest, intravenous fluids and antibiotics. This topic covers: Symptoms of acute cholecystitis When to seek medical advice What causes acute cholecysitis Diagnosing cholecystitis Treating cholecystitis Possible complications Preventing cholecystitis Symptoms of cholecystitis The main symptom of acute cholecystitis is a sudden sharp pain in the upper right-hand side of your tummy (abdomen). This pain spreads towards your right shoulder. The affected part of the abdomen is usually very tender, and breathing deeply can make the pain worse. Unlike other types of abdominal pain, the pain of acute cholecystitis is usually persistent and doesn't go away within a few hours. Some people may have additional symptoms, such as: a high temperature (fever) nausea and vomiting sweating loss of appetite yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) a bulge in the abdomen When to seek medical advice See your GP as soon as possible if you develop sudden and severe abdominal pain, particularly if it lasts longer than a few hours or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as jaundice and a fever. If you're unable to contact your GP immediately, phone your local out-of-hours service or call NHS 111 for advice. It's important for acute cholecystitis to be diagnosed as soon as possible as there's a risk serious complications could develop if it isn't treated promptly.   What causes acute cholecystitis? The causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into two main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis. Calculous cholecystitis Calculous cholecystitis is the most common, and usually less serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases. Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, called the cystic duct, gets blocked by a gallstone or a substance known as biliary sludge. Biliary sludge is a mixture of bile, a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats, and small cholesterol and salt crystals. The blockage in the cystic duct causes bile to build up in the gallbladder, increasing the pressure inside it and causing it to become inflamed. In around one in every five cases, the inflamed gallbladder also becomes infected by bacteria. Acalculous cholecystitis Acalculous cholecystitis is a less common, but usually more serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It usually develops as a complication of a serious illness, infection or injury that damages the gallbladder. Acalculous cholecystitis can be caused by accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery, serious injuries or burns, blood poisoning (sepsis), severe malnutrition or AIDS. Diagnosing acute cholecystitis If you have severe abdominal pain, your GP will probably carry out a simple test called Murphy's sign. You'll be asked to breathe in deeply with your GP's hand pressed on your tummy, just below your rib cage. Your gallbladder will move downwards as you breathe in. If you have cholecystitis, you'll experience sudden pain as your gallbladder reaches your doctor's hand. If your symptoms suggest you have acute cholecystitis, your GP will refer you to hospital immediately for further tests and treatment. Tests you may have in hospital include: blood tests \u2013 to check for signs of inflammation in your body an ultrasound scan of your abdomen \u2013 to check for gallstones or other signs of a problem with your gallbladder Other scans \u2013 such as an X-ray, computerised tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u2013 may also be carried out to examine your gallbladder in more detail if there's any uncertainty about your diagnosis. Treating acute cholecystitis If you're diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, you'll probably need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. Initial treatment Initial treatment will usually involve: not eating or drinking (fasting) to take the strain off your gallbladder receiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to prevent dehydration taking medication to relieve your pain You'll also be given antibiotics if it's thought you have an infection. These often need to be continued for up to a week, during which time you may need to stay in hospital, or you may be able to go home. After initial treatment, any gallstones that may have caused acute cholecystitis usually fall back into the gallbladder and the inflammation will often settle down. Surgery Removing your gallbladder may be recommended at some point after initial treatment to prevent acute cholecystitis recurring and reduce your risk of developing potentially serious complications. This type of surgery is known as a cholecystectomy. Although uncommon, an alternative procedure called a percutaneous cholecystostomy may be carried out if you're too unwell to have surgery. This is where a needle is inserted through your abdomen to drain away the fluid that's built up in the gallbladder. If you're fit enough to have surgery, your doctors will decide when the best time to remove your gallbladder is. In some cases you may need to have surgery immediately or in the next day or two, or it may be necessary to wait a few weeks until the inflammation has settled down. Surgery can be carried out in three ways: laparoscopic cholecystectomy \u2013 a type of keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed using special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts (incisions) in your abdomen single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy \u2013 where the gallbladder is removed through a single incision, which is usually made near the bellybutton open cholecystectomy \u2013 where the gallbladder is removed through a single larger incision in the abdomen Although some people who've had their gallbladder removed have reported symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating certain foods, it's possible to lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. The organ can be useful, but it's not essential as your liver will still produce bile to digest food. Read more about recovering from gallbladder removal. Possible complications Without appropriate treatment, acute cholecystitis can sometimes lead to potentially life-threatening complications. The main complications of acute cholecystitis are: the death of gallbladder tissue (gangrenous cholecystitis) \u2013 which can cause a serious infection that could spread throughout the body the gallbladder splitting open (perforated gallbladder) \u2013 which can spread the infection within your abdomen (peritonitis) or lead to a build-up of pus (abscess) Emergency surgery to remove the gallbladder is needed to treat these complications in about one in every five cases of acute cholecystitis. Preventing acute cholecystitis It isn't always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis, but you can lower your risk of developing it by reducing your risk of getting gallstones. One of the main things you can do to lower your chances of getting gallstones is to adopt a healthy, balanced diet and reduce the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones. Being overweight, particularly being obese, also increases your risk of developing gallstones. You should therefore control your weight by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly. However, low-calorie rapid weight loss diets should be avoided because there's evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and actually increase your risk of developing gallstones. A more gradual weight loss plan is best.  Read more about preventing gallstones. The gallbladder The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ located beneath the liver. It's main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. The liver produces bile, a liquid that helps digest fats and carries toxins excreted by the liver. Bile is passed from the liver through a series of channels called bile ducts into the gallbladder, where it's stored. Over time bile becomes more concentrated, which makes it more effective at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed. The gallbladder is an organ that's useful, but not essential. It can safely be removed without interfering with your ability to digest food.

It can range from minor loss of kidney function to complete kidney failure. AKI normally happens as a complication of another serious illness. It's not the result of a physical blow to the kidneys, as the name might suggest. This type of kidney damage is usually seen in older people who are unwell with other conditions and the kidneys are also affected. Read more about who's at risk of AKI. It's essential that AKI is detected early and treated promptly. The role of the kidneys is to: filter \u2013 removing waste and water from the blood (as urine, via the bladder) clean the blood keep the bones healthy look after blood pressure stimulate the bone marrow to make blood Without quick treatment, abnormal levels of salts and chemicals can build up in the body, which affects the ability of other organs to work properly.  If the kidneys shut down completely, this may require temporary support from a dialysis machine, or lead to death. Symptoms of acute kidney injury In the early stages of AKI, there may not be any symptoms. The only possible warning sign may be that the person isn't producing much urine, although this isn't always the case. However, someone with AKI can deteriorate quickly and suddenly experience any of the following: nausea and vomiting dehydration confusion high blood pressure abdominal pain slight backache a build-up of fluid in the body (oedema) Even if it doesn't progress to complete kidney failure, AKI needs to be taken seriously. It has an effect on the whole body, changes how some drugs are handled by the body and could make some existing illnesses more serious. AKI is different to chronic kidney disease, where the kidneys gradually lose function over a long period of time. Who's at risk of acute kidney injury? You're more likely to get AKI if: you're aged 65 or over you already have a kidney problem, such as chronic kidney disease you have a long-term disease, such as heart failure, liver disease or diabetes you're dehydrated or unable to maintain your fluid intake independently you have a blockage in your urinary tract (or are at risk of this) you have a severe infection or sepsis you're taking certain medicines, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS, such as ibuprofen) or blood pressure drugs, such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics; diuretics are usually beneficial to the kidneys, but may become less helpful when a person is dehydrated or suffering from a severe illness you're given aminoglycosides \u2013 a type of antibiotic; again, this is only an issue if the person is dehydrated or ill, and these are usually only given in a hospital setting AKI is estimated to affect 13-18% of people admitted to hospital. It can affect both adults and children. Causes of acute kidney injury Most cases of AKI are caused by reduced blood flow to the kidneys, usually in someone who is already unwell with another health condition. This reduced blood flow could be caused by: low blood volume after bleeding, excessive vomiting or diarrhoea, or as seen with severe dehydration the heart pumping out less blood than normal as a result of heart failure, liver failure or sepsis, for example problems with the blood vessels \u2013 such as inflammation and blockage in the blood vessels within the kidneys (a rare condition called vasculitis) certain medicines (see above), which can affect the blood supply to the kidney \u2013 other medicines may cause unusual reactions in the kidney itself AKI can also be caused by a problem with the kidney itself, such as glomerulonephritis. This may be caused by a reaction to some drugs, infections or contrast medium (the liquid dye used in some types of X-rays). It may also be due to a blockage affecting the drainage of the kidneys, such as: an enlarged prostate a tumour in the pelvis \u2013 such as an ovarian or bladder tumour kidney stones When should AKI be suspected? A doctor may suspect AKI in people known to be at risk who suddenly fall ill or develop symptoms which suggest complications of AKI. AKI may also be suspected in people who have been unwell for a while and have either: chronic kidney disease  a urinary system disease new or worsening urinary symptoms symptoms or signs of a disease affecting the kidneys and other organs Diagnosing acute kidney injury AKI can be diagnosed after measuring urine output and doing blood tests. Blood levels of creatinine \u2013 a chemical waste product produced by the muscles \u2013 will be measured. Healthy kidneys filter creatinine and other waste products from the blood and these are excreted, in the form of urine. It's an easy and quick marker of kidney function, with higher levels of creatinine in the blood indicating poorer kidney function. In adults, a diagnosis of AKI can be made if: blood creatinine level has risen from the baseline value for that person (by 26 micromoles per litre or more within 48 hours) blood creatinine level has risen over time (by 50% or more within the past 7 days) they are passing much less urine (less than 0.5ml per kg per hour for more than 6 hours) In children and teenagers, doctors should use the plasma creatinine level to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). A diagnosis of AKI is made if they have a 25% or greater fall in eGFR within the past 7 days. Read more about AKI in children. Investigating the underlying cause Urine can be tested for protein, blood cells, sugar and waste products, which may give clues to the underlying cause. Doctors also need to know about: any other symptoms \u2013 such as signs of sepsis or signs of heart failure any other medical conditions any medication that's been taken in the past week \u2013 as some medicines can cause AKI An ultrasound scan should reveal if the cause is a blockage in the urinary system, such as an enlarged prostate or bladder tumour. Treating acute kidney injury Treatment of AKI depends on the underlying cause and extent of illness. In most cases, treating the underlying problem will cure the AKI. GPs may be able to manage mild cases in people who aren't already in hospital. They may: advise stopping any medication that may be causing the situation, or making it worse \u2013 it may be safe to resume some of these when the problem is sorted treat any underlying infections advise on fluid intake to prevent dehydration (which could cause or worsen AKI) take blood tests to monitor levels of creatinine and salt \u2013 to check how well a person is recovering refer to a urologist (genitourinary surgeon) or nephrologist (kidney specialist) if the cause isn't clear or if a more serious cause is suspected Admission to hospital is necessary in cases where: there's an underlying cause that needs urgent treatment \u2013 such as a urinary blockage, or if the person is seriously unwell; most people need hospital care to treat the underlying cause, allowing the AKI to get better there's a risk of urinary blockage \u2013 because of prostate disease, for example the person's condition has deteriorated, and regular blood and urine tests are needed to monitor how well their kidneys are working the person has a complication of AKI The majority of people who recover from AKI end up with a very similar level of kidney function as they had before they became ill, or go on to have normal kidney function.   However, some people go on to develop chronic kidney disease or long-term kidney failure as a result. In severe cases, dialysis \u2013 where a machine filters the blood to rid the body of harmful waste, extra salt and water \u2013 may be needed. Preventing acute kidney injury Those at risk of AKI should be monitored with regular blood tests if they become unwell or start new medication. It's also useful to check how much urine you're passing. Any warning signs of AKI, such as vomiting or producing little urine, require immediate investigation for AKI and treatment. People who are dehydrated, or at risk of dehydration, may need to be given fluids via a drip. Any medicine that seems to be making the problem worse, or directly damaging the kidneys needs to be stopped, at least temporarily. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced detailed guidelines on preventing, detecting and managing AKI. Read the NICE guidelines here. Complications of acute kidney injury The most serious complications of acute kidney injury are: high levels of potassium in the blood \u2013 in severe cases, this can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and heart rhythm problems fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) acidic blood (metabolic acidosis) \u2013 which can cause nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and breathlessness Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 11\/04\/2016 Next review due: 11\/04\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected by cancer. There are two main types: lymphocytes, which are mostly used to fight viral infections neutrophils, which perform several functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage  These pages focus on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, which is cancer of the lymphocytes. The following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia chronic myeloid leukaemia acute myeloid leukaemia Warning signs of acute leukaemia Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of immature white blood cells in your blood increases (see below for an explanation of this). Symptoms include: pale skin tiredness breathlessness having repeated infections over a short space of time unusual and frequent bleeding Read more about the symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. What happens in acute leukaemia All of the blood cells in the body are produced by bone marrow \u2013 a spongy material found inside bones. Bone marrow produces specialised cells called stem cells which have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cells: red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body white blood cells, which help fight infection platelets, which help stop bleeding Usually the bone marrow produces stem cells which are allowed to fully develop before being released into the blood. But in acute leukaemia, bone marrow starts releasing large numbers of immature white blood cells known as blast cells. As the number of blast cells increases there is a drop in the number of red blood cells and platelet cells. This drop causes the symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and increases the risk of excessive bleeding. Also, blast cells are less effective than mature white blood cells at fighting bacteria and viruses, making you more vulnerable to infection. How common is acute lymphoblastic leukaemia? Around 8,600 people are diagnosed with leukaemia each year in the UK. In 2011, 654 people were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Despite being uncommon overall, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common type of cancer to affect children. Approximately one in every 2,000 children will develop it. About 85% of cases occur in children aged under 15, mostly between the ages of two and five years old. The cause or causes of acute leukaemia are uncertain, but known risk factors include: exposure to high levels of radiation exposure to benzene, a chemical used in manufacturing that is also found in cigarettes Read more information about the causes of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Outlook The outlook for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is usually good. Almost all children will achieve a remission (a period of time where they are free from symptoms) from their symptoms, and 85% will be completely cured. The outlook for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is less promising as only 40% of people with the condition will be completely cured. Treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually involve a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In some cases, a bone marrow transplant may also be needed to achieve a cure. Read more about the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. If a cure is not possible, there is a risk that the lack of healthy blood cells can make the person extremely vulnerable to life-threatening infections (due to the lack of white blood cells) or uncontrolled and serious bleeding (due to the lack of platelets).

Acute leukaemia means it progresses rapidly and aggressively, and usually requires immediate treatment. Acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected. The two main types of white blood cells are: lymphocytes \u2013 mostly used to fight viral infections myeloid cells \u2013 which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage  This topic focuses on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is an aggressive cancer of the myeloid cells. The following types of leukaemia are covered separately: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia chronic myeloid leukaemia chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Signs and symptoms of AML The symptoms of AML usually develop over a few weeks and become increasingly more severe. Symptoms can include: pale skin tiredness breathlessness frequent infections unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds In more advanced cases, AML can make you extremely vulnerable to life-threatening infections or serious internal bleeding. Read more about the complications of AML. Seeking medical advice You should see your GP if you or your child have possible symptoms of AML. Although it's highly unlikely that leukaemia is the cause, these symptoms should be investigated. If your GP thinks you may have leukaemia, they'll arrange blood tests to check your blood cell production. If the tests suggest there's a problem, you'll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions) for further tests and any necessary treatment. Read more about diagnosing AML. What causes AML? AML occurs when specialised cells called stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow (a spongy material inside the bones), produce too many immature white blood cells. These immature cells are known as blast cells. Blast cells don't have the infection-fighting properties of healthy white blood cells, and producing too many can lead to a decrease in the number of red blood cells (which carry oxygen in the blood) and platelets (cells that help the blood to clot). It's not clear exactly why this happens and, in most cases, there's no identifiable cause. However, a number of factors that can increase your risk of developing AML have been identified. These include: previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy exposure to very high levels of radiation (including previous  radiotherapy treatment) exposure to benzene \u2013 a chemical used in manufacturing that's also found in cigarette smoke having an underlying blood disorder or genetic disorder, such as Down's syndrome Read more about the causes of AML. Who's affected AML is a rare type of cancer, with around 2,600 people diagnosed with it each year in the UK. The risk of developing AML increases with age. It's most common in people over 65. How AML is treated AML is an aggressive type of cancer that can develop rapidly, so treatment usually needs to begin soon after a diagnosis is confirmed. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for AML. It's used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing). In some cases, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed, in combination with a bone marrow or stem cell transplant, to achieve a cure. Read more about treating AML. Outlook The outlook for AML largely depends on the specific type of AML you have, as well as your age and general health. There are many subtypes of AML, which are classified according to various features \u2013 such as the specific genetic changes in the leukaemia cells. Some types of AML are more challenging to treat than others. Even if treatment is initially successful, there's still a significant risk that the condition will return at some point during the next few years. If this happens, treatment may need to be repeated. A number of medical trials have suggested that almost half of those aged under 60 diagnosed with AML will live for at least five years, and in some types of AML, such as acute promyeloid leukaemia (APML), around 85% will live for at least five years. In general, the outlook for children with AML tends to be better than that of adults diagnosed with the condition.

The pancreas is a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage. Most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and experience no further problems, but severe cases can have serious complications and can even be fatal. Acute pancreatitis is different to chronic pancreatitis, where the inflammation of the pancreas persists for many years. The most common symptoms of acute pancreatitis include: suddenly getting severe pain in the centre of your abdomen (tummy) feeling or being sick diarrhoea Read more about the symptoms of acute pancreatitis and diagnosing acute pancreatitis. When to seek medical help Contact your GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. If this isn't possible, contact NHS 111 or your local out-of-hours service for advice. Why it happens It's thought that acute pancreatitis occurs when a problem develops with some of the enzymes (chemicals) in the pancreas, which causes them to try to digest the organ. Acute pancreatitis is most often linked to: gallstones \u2013 which accounts for around half of all cases alcohol consumption \u2013 which accounts for about a quarter of all cases By reducing your alcohol intake and altering your diet to make gallstones less likely, you can help to reduce your chances of developing acute pancreatitis. Read more about the causes of acute pancreatitis and preventing acute pancreatitis. Who is affected? Acute pancreatitis is more common in middle-aged and elderly people, but it can affect people of any age. Men are more likely to develop alcohol-related pancreatitis, while women are more likely to develop it as a result of gallstones. In England, more than 25,000 people were admitted to hospital with acute pancreatitis between 2013 and 2014.  How it's treated Treatment for acute pancreatitis focuses on supporting the functions of the body until the inflammation has passed. This usually involves admission to hospital so you can be given fluids into a vein (intravenous fluids), as well as pain relief, nutritional support and oxygen through tubes into your nose. Most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and are well enough to leave hospital after 5-10 days. However, recovery takes longer in severe cases, as complications that require additional treatment may develop. Read more about treating acute pancreatitis. Complications About four out of five cases of acute pancreatitis improve quickly and don't cause any serious further problems. However, one in five cases are severe and can result in life-threatening complications, such as multiple organ failure. In severe cases where complications develop, there's a high risk of the condition being fatal. In England, just over 1,000 people die from acute pancreatitis every year. If a person survives the effects of severe acute pancreatitis, it's likely to be several weeks or months before they're well enough to leave hospital.

ARDS can affect people of any age and usually develops as a complication of a serious existing health condition. Consequently, most people have already been admitted to hospital by the time the symptoms of ARDS begin. Symptoms of ARDS can include: severe shortness of breath rapid, shallow breathing tiredness, drowsiness or confusion feeling faint Medical emergency Although most cases of ARDS begin in hospital, this isn't always the case. For example, the condition may develop quickly as a result of an infection such as pneumonia, or if someone accidentally inhales their vomit. Dial 999 immediately to request an ambulance if you notice any breathing problems in a child or adult. What causes ARDS? ARDS develops if the lungs become severely inflamed as a result of an infection or injury. The inflammation causes fluid from nearby blood vessels to leak into the tiny air sacs in your lungs, making breathing increasingly difficult. The lungs may become inflamed following: pneumonia or severe flu blood poisoning (sepsis) a severe chest injury   accidental inhalation of vomit, smoke or toxic chemicals near drowning acute pancreatitis \u2013 a serious condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed over a short period of time  an adverse reaction to a blood transfusion How ARDS is diagnosed There's no specific test to diagnose ARDS. A full assessment is needed to identify the underlying cause and rule out other conditions. This assessment is likely to include: a physical examination blood tests \u2013 to measure the amount of oxygen in the blood and check for an infection a pulse oximetry test \u2013 where a sensor attached to the fingertip, ear or toe is used to measure how much oxygen the blood is absorbing a chest X-ray and a computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 to look for evidence of ARDS an echocardiogram \u2013 a type of ultrasound scan used to create a picture of the heart Treating ARDS If someone develops ARDS, they'll probably be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and put on a ventilator to assist their breathing. In some cases, it may be possible to use an oxygen mask to supply oxygen. However, in severe cases of ARDS, a tube will need to be inserted down the throat and into the lungs to allow oxygen to be pumped in. Fluids and nutrients will be supplied through a tube that goes into the stomach through the nose. Read more about feeding tubes. The underlying cause of ARDS should also be treated. For example, if it's caused by a bacterial infection, antibiotics may need to be prescribed to help fight the infection. The amount of time you need to spend in hospital will depend on your individual circumstances and the cause of ARDS. Most people respond well to treatment within days, but it may be several weeks or months before someone with ARDS is well enough to leave hospital. Complications of ARDS As ARDS is often caused by a serious health condition, about one in three people who develop it will die. However, most deaths result from another problem caused by their illness, rather than ARDS itself. For people who survive, the main complications are associated with nerve and muscle damage, which causes pain and weakness. Some people also develop psychological problems, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. The lungs themselves usually recover and long-term (chronic) lung failure after ARDS is rare. Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) Sometimes a newborn baby's lungs are underdeveloped and unable to provide their body with enough oxygen. This is known as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) and usually affects premature babies. Although the conditions have similar names, NRDS isn't related to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).   Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 18\/03\/2015 Next review due: 18\/03\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

This affects the heart's ability to pump blood around the body. Some types of cardiomyopathy are inherited and are seen in children and younger people. This page explains the main types of cardiomyopathy: dilated cardiomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy takotsubo cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome' It then explains:  diagnosing cardiomyopathy treating cardiomyopathy information about you Dilated cardiomyopathy In dilated cardiomyopathy the muscle walls of the heart have become stretched and thin, so they can't contract (squeeze) properly to pump blood around the body. How serious is it? If you have dilated cardiomyopathy, you're at greater risk of heart failure, where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure. Heart failure typically causes shortness of breath, extreme tiredness and ankle swelling. Learn more about the symptoms of heart failure. There's also a risk of heart valve problems, an irregular heartbeat and blood clots. You'll need to have regular appointments with your GP so the disease can be monitored. Who's affected? Dilated cardiomyopathy can affect both children and adults.  The heart muscle can become stretched if you have an unhealthy lifestyle or an underlying medical condition, or both. The following can all play a role in the disease: uncontrolled high blood pressure an unhealthy lifestyle \u2013 such as a lack of vitamins and minerals in the diet, heavy drinking and recreational drug use a viral infection that causes inflammation of the heart muscle   a heart valve problem a disease of the body tissues or vessels \u2013 such as Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, lupus, polyarteritis nodosa, vasculitis or muscular dystrophy inheriting a mutated (changed) gene that makes you more vulnerable to the disease pregnancy \u2013 cardiomyopathy can sometimes develop as a complication of pregnancy But for many people, the cause is unknown. More information Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on living with dilated cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle cells have enlarged and the walls of the heart chambers thicken. The chambers are reduced in size so they can't hold much blood, and the walls can't relax properly and may stiffen. How serious is it? Most people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will be able to live a full, normal life. Some people don't even have symptoms and don't need treatment. But that doesn't mean the condition can't be serious. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden unexpected death in childhood and in young athletes. The main heart chambers can become stiff, leading to back pressure on the smaller collecting chambers. This can sometimes worsen the symptoms of heart failure and lead to abnormal heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation). Blood flow from the heart may become reduced or restricted (known as obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Also, the mitral heart valve can become leaky, causing blood to leak backwards. Read more about mitral regurgitation. These heart changes can cause dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath and temporary loss of consciousness. You'll also be at greater risk of developing endocarditis (a heart infection). If you have severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, you'll need to see your doctor regularly so your condition can be monitored. Your doctor will advise about the level and amount of exercise you can do and sensible lifestyle changes to make.  Who's affected? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is thought to affect 1 in 500 people in the UK. Most people inherit the disease from their parents. Read more about how genetic conditions are inherited.   More information Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on living with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy is rare and mostly affects older adults. The walls of the main heart chambers become stiffened and rigid and can't relax properly after contracting. This means the heart can't fill up properly with blood. It results in reduced blood flow from the heart and can lead to symptoms of heart failure, such as breathlessness, tiredness and ankle swelling, as well as heart rhythm problems. In many cases the cause is unknown, although sometimes it can be inherited. More information Read the American Heart Association's leaflet on restrictive cardiomyopathy (PDF, 102kb). Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy In arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), the proteins that normally hold the heart muscle cells together are abnormal. Muscle cells can die and the dead muscle tissue is replaced with fatty and fibrous tissue. The walls of the main heart chambers become thin and stretched, and can't pump blood around the body properly. People with ARVC typically have heart rhythm problems. Reduced blood flow from the heart can also lead to symptoms of heart failure. ARVC is an uncommon inherited condition caused by a mutation (change) in one or more genes. It can affect teenagers or young adults and has been the reason for some sudden unexplained deaths in young athletes. There's increasing evidence that prolonged, strenuous exercise worsens the symptoms of ARVC. It's important that people with or at risk of ARVC have a careful discussion about this with their cardiologist. More information Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on ARVC. Diagnosing cardiomyopathy Some cases of cardiomyopathy can be diagnosed after various heart scans and tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an echocardiogram. Cardiomyopathy that runs in the family can be diagnosed after a genetic test. If you've been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, you may be advised to have a genetic test to identify the mutation (faulty gene) that caused this. Your relatives can then be tested for the same mutation and, if they have it, their condition can be monitored and managed early. Treating cardiomyopathy  There's no cure for cardiomyopathy, but the treatments described below are usually effective at controlling symptoms and preventing complications. Not everyone with cardiomyopathy will need treatment. Some people only have a mild form of the disease that they can control after making a few lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes If the cause of your cardiomyopathy isn't genetic, it should generally help to: follow a healthy diet and take gentle exercise quit smoking (if you smoke) lose weight (if you're overweight) avoid or reduce your intake of alcohol  get plenty of sleep manage stress make sure any underlying condition, such as diabetes, is well controlled  Medication Medication may be needed to control blood pressure, correct an abnormal heart rhythm, remove excess fluid or prevent blood clots.  Read about: medication for high blood pressure beta-blockers to treat an irregular heartbeat or heart failure diuretics to remove excess fluid from your body if this has caused swelling anticoagulants such as warfarin to prevent blood clots medication to treat heart failure Hospital procedures In some people with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the septum (the wall dividing the left and right side of the heart) is thickened and bulges into the main heart chamber. They may need to have either: an injection of alcohol into their heart \u2013 this is to reduce part of the muscle in the septum a septal myectomy \u2013 heart surgery to remove part of the thickened septum (the mitral valve may be repaired at the same time, if necessary) Those with heart rhythm problems may need to have a pacemaker, or a similar device, implanted to control their abnormal heart rhythm. Read more about having a pacemaker fitted. As a last resort, a heart transplant may be necessary. Information about you If you have cardiomyopathy, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. GOV.UK has more information about the register. Broken heart syndrome Some people who sustain significant emotional or physical stress, such as bereavement or major surgery, go on to experience a temporary heart problem. The heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or \"stunned\", causing the left ventricle (one of the heart's main chambers) to change shape. It may be caused by a surge of hormones, particularly adrenaline, during this period of stress. The main symptoms are chest pain and breathlessness, similar to those of a heart attack \u2013 always call 999 if you or someone else experiences these. The condition \u2013 known medically as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or acute stress cardiomyopathy \u2013 is temporary and reversible. It's unusual for it to happen again.

Alcohol consumption is measured in units. A unit of alcohol is 10ml of pure alcohol, which is about: half a pint of normal-strength lager a single measure (25ml) of spirits A small glass (125ml) of wine contains about 1.5 units of alcohol. Lower-risk limits To keep your risk of alcohol-related harm low, the NHS recommends: not regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it's best to spread this evenly over three or more days if you're trying to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, it's a good idea to have several alcohol-free days each week Regular or frequent drinking means drinking alcohol most weeks. The risk to your health is increased by drinking any amount of alcohol on a regular basis. Risks of alcohol misuse Short-term The short-term risks of alcohol misuse include: accidents and injuries requiring hospital treatment, such as a head injury violent behaviour and being a victim of violence unprotected sex that could potentially lead to unplanned pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) loss of personal possessions, such as wallets, keys or mobile phones alcohol poisoning \u2013 this may lead to vomiting, seizures (fits) and falling unconscious People who binge drink (drink heavily over a short period of time) are more likely to behave recklessly and are at greater risk of being in an accident. Long-term Persistent alcohol misuse increases your risk of serious health conditions, including: heart disease stroke liver disease liver cancer and bowel cancer mouth cancer  pancreatitis  As well as causing serious health problems, long-term alcohol misuse can lead to social problems, such as unemployment, divorce, domestic abuse and homelessness. If someone loses control over their drinking and has an excessive desire to drink, it's known as dependent drinking (alcoholism). Dependent drinking usually affects a person's quality of life and relationships, but they may not always find it easy to see or accept this.  Severely dependent drinkers are often able to tolerate very high levels of alcohol in amounts that would dangerously affect or even kill some people. A dependent drinker usually experiences physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms if they suddenly cut down or stop drinking, including: hand tremors \u2013 \"the shakes\" sweating seeing things that aren't real (visual hallucinations) depression anxiety difficulty sleeping (insomnia) This often leads to \"relief drinking\" to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Read more about the risks of alcohol misuse. Am I drinking too much alcohol? You could be misusing alcohol if: you feel you should cut down on your drinking other people have been criticising your drinking you feel guilty or bad about your drinking you need a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover Someone you know may be misusing alcohol if: they regularly exceed the lower-risk daily limit for alcohol they're sometimes unable to remember what happened the night before because of their drinking they fail to do what was expected of them as a result of their drinking \u2013 for example, missing an appointment or work because of being drunk or hungover Getting help If you're concerned about your drinking or someone else's, a good first step is to visit your GP. They'll be able to discuss the services and treatments available.  Your alcohol intake may be assessed using tests, such as: the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (PDF, 224kb) \u2013 a widely used screening test that can help determine whether you need to change your drinking habits the Fast Alcohol Screening Test \u2013 a simpler test to check whether your drinking has reached dangerous levels the Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire \u2013 this helps identify how severely dependent on alcohol you may be As well as the NHS, there are a number of charities and support groups across the UK that provide support and advice for people with an alcohol misuse problem. For example, you may want to contact: Alcohol Concern \u2013 runs the national drink helpline, Drinkline on 0300 123 1110 Alcoholics Anonymous \u2013 helpline 0845 769 7555 Al-Anon Family Groups \u2013 helpline 020 7403 0888 For a full list of charities and support groups, see our page on alcohol support. Treating alcohol misuse How alcohol misuse is treated depends on how much alcohol a person is drinking. Treatment options include: counselling \u2013 including self-help groups and talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) medication detoxification \u2013 this involves a nurse or doctor supporting you to safely stop drinking; this can be done by helping you slowly cut down over time or by giving you medicines to prevent withdrawal symptoms There are two main types of medicines to help people stop drinking. The first is to help stop withdrawal symptoms, and is given in reducing doses over a short period of time. The most common of these medicines is chlordiazapoxide (Librium). The second is a medication to reduce any urge you may have to drink. The most common medications used for this are acamprosate and naltrexone. These are both given at a fixed dose, and you'll usually be on them for 6 to 12 months. Read more about the treatment options for alcohol misuse.

Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, and the risk increases the more you drink. The Chief Medical Officers for the UK recommend that if you're pregnant, or planning to become pregnant, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all to keep the risk to your baby to a minimum. If you're trying to conceive, your partner should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week, which should be spread evenly over three days or more. Drinking alcohol excessively can affect the quality of his sperm.   Page last reviewed: 28\/11\/2015 Next review due: 28\/11\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The adrenal glands are two small glands that sit on top of the kidneys. They produce two essential hormones: cortisol and aldosterone. In Addison's disease, the adrenal gland is damaged, and not enough cortisol and aldosterone are produced. About 8,400 people in the UK have Addison's disease. It can affect people of any age, although it's most common between the ages of 30 and 50. It's also more common in women than men. Early-stage symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease are similar to other more common health conditions, such as depression or flu. You may experience: fatigue (lack of energy or motivation) muscle weakness low mood loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss increased thirst Over time, these problems may become more severe and you may experience further symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting, cramps and exhaustion. You may also develop small areas of darkened skin, or darkened lips or gums. Although these symptoms aren\u2019t always caused by Addison\u2019s disease, you should see your GP, so they can be investigated. Read more about the symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease and diagnosing Addison\u2019s disease. Why it happens The condition is usually the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack the outer layer of the adrenal gland (the adrenal cortex), disrupting the production of steroid hormones aldosterone and cortisol. It's not clear why this happens, but it's responsible for 70-90% of cases in the UK. Other potential causes include conditions that can damage the adrenal glands, such as tuberculosis (TB), although this is uncommon in the UK. Read more about the causes of Addison\u2019s disease. Treating Addison's disease Addison\u2019s disease is treated with medication to replace the missing hormones. You'll need to take the medication for the rest of your life. With treatment, symptoms of Addison's disease can largely be controlled. Most people with the condition live a normal lifespan and are able to live an active life, with few limitations. However, many people with Addison's disease also find they must learn to manage bouts of fatigue and there may be associated health conditions, such as diabetes or an underactive thyroid. People with Addison's disease must be constantly aware of the risk of a sudden worsening of symptoms, called an adrenal crisis. This can happen when the levels of cortisol in your body fall significantly. An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it can be fatal. If you or someone you know has Addison\u2019s disease and is experiencing severe symptoms, dial 999 for an ambulance. Read more about treating Addison's disease. Information about you If you have Addison's disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

What are adenoids? Adenoids are part of the immune system, which helps fight infection and protects the body from bacteria and viruses. Adenoids are only present in children. They start to grow from birth and are biggest when your child is approximately three to five years old. But by age seven to eight they start to shrink and by the late teens, are barely visible. By adulthood, the adenoids will have disappeared completely. The adenoids disappear because \u2013 although they may be helpful in young children \u2013 they're not an essential part of an adult's immune system. You will not be able to see your child's adenoids by looking in their mouth. When do adenoids need removing? It may be necessary to remove the adenoids if they become swollen or enlarged due to: infection with bacteria or a virus (adenoiditis) \u2013 although the infection will eventually clear up, the adenoids may remain enlarged allergies \u2013 allergens (substances that trigger an allergic reaction) can sometimes irritate the adenoids, making them swell up Adenoids can also be removed to treat recurrent ear infections or glue ear. Read more about why adenoids need to be removed. What is an adenoidectomy? An adenoidectomy is a quick operation to remove the adenoids. It takes about 30 minutes to perform and is carried out in hospital by an ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon. In most cases your child can go home on the same day once the effects of the anaesthetic have worn off. Read more about how an adenoidectomy is performed and recovering from an adenoidectomy. Are there any risks? The operation carries very few risks. Removing the adenoids will not put your child at greater risk of developing infection. The body's immune system is perfectly able to cope with bacteria and viruses without the adenoids. However, as with all surgery, there is a small risk of complications such as infection, bleeding, nasal discharge, or an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic. There may also be some temporary minor health problems such as a sore throat, earache or a blocked nose for a few weeks. Read more information about the risks of an adenoidectomy.

Symptoms of ADHD tend to be noticed at an early age and may become more noticeable when a child's circumstances change, such as when they start school. Most cases are diagnosed when children are 6 to 12 years old. The symptoms of ADHD usually improve with age, but many adults who are diagnosed with the condition at a young age continue to experience problems. People with ADHD may also have additional problems, such as sleep and anxiety disorders. Read more about the symptoms of ADHD. Getting help  Many children go through phases where they're restless or inattentive. This is often completely normal and doesn't necessarily mean they have ADHD. However, you should consider raising your concerns with your child's teacher, their school's special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) or GP if you think their behaviour may be different to most children their age. It's also a good idea to speak to your GP if you're an adult and you think you may have ADHD, but you weren't diagnosed with the condition as a child. Read more about diagnosing ADHD. What causes ADHD? The exact cause of ADHD is unknown, but the condition has been shown to run in families. Research has also identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD compared to those who don't have the condition. Other factors that have been suggested as potentially having a role in ADHD include: being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) having a low birthweight smoking, alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy ADHD is more common in boys than girls. It's thought that around 2% to 5% of school-aged children may have the condition. ADHD can occur in people of any intellectual ability, although it's more common in people with learning difficulties. Read more about the causes of ADHD. How ADHD is treated Although there's no cure for ADHD, it can be managed with appropriate educational support, advice and support for parents and affected children, alongside medication, if necessary. Medication is often the first treatment offered to adults with ADHD, although psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may also help. Read more about treating ADHD. Living with ADHD Looking after a child with ADHD can be challenging, but it's important to remember that they can't help their behaviour. Some issues that may arise in day-to-day life include: getting your child to sleep at night getting ready for school on time listening to and carrying out instructions being organised social occasions shopping Adults with ADHD may also find they have similar problems, and some may have issues with drugs, crime and employment. Read about living with ADHD for information on ways to cope with these issues.

What's the best way of dealing with an active child? (9 to 30 months) Media last reviewed: 17\/01\/2015 Next review due: 17\/01\/2017 Young children like to be active, and it's normal for them to have lots of energy. Keeping babies and toddlers active every day is good for their health. Looking after a child who is always on the go can be tiring and stressful, but there are things you can do to make life easier for both of you. Tips for daily life with a very active child keep to a daily routine \u2013 routine can help if your child is restless or difficult; it can also help you stay calm and cope with the strain dedicate time to your child \u2013 since your child may be demanding your attention for most of the day (and sometimes at night, too) you'll often have to say no to them; that will be easier to do and easier for your child to accept if there are times each day when you give them all your attention avoid difficult situations \u2013 for example, keep shopping trips short try to go out every day \u2013 go to a park, playground or other safe, open space where your child can run around and use up energy set small goals \u2013 help your child to sit still or be controlled, and encourage them to concentrate for a very short time, then gradually build it up; remember, you can't transform your child's behaviour overnight Many children seem overactive, but only about 2% of children in the UK have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is what used to be known as hyperactivity. The challenge for parents and health professionals is to recognise the difference between the normal energy levels of a young child and ADHD symptoms. Identifying ADHD early is important to make sure your child gets the support they need. If you are worried about your child's behaviour, talk to your health visitor or GP.

It mainly affects babies and young children. Normally, the bowel continuously squeezes and relaxes to push poo along, a process controlled by your nervous system. In Hirschsprung's disease, the nerves that control this movement are missing from a section at the end of the bowel, which means poo can build up and form a blockage. This can cause severe constipation, and occasionally lead to a serious bowel infection called enterocolitis if it's not identified and treated early on. However, the condition is usually picked up soon after birth and treated with surgery as soon as possible. This page covers: Symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease When to get medical advice How Hirschsprung's disease is diagnosed What causes Hirschsprung's disease? Treatments for Hirschsprung's disease Outlook for Hirschsprung's disease Symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease Symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease are usually noticeable from soon after a baby is born, although occasionally they're not obvious until a child is a year or two old. Signs of the condition in a baby include: failing to pass meconium within 48 hours \u2013 the dark, tar-like poo that healthy babies pass soon after being born a swollen belly vomiting green fluid (bile) Signs in older infants and children include: a swollen belly and a tummy ache persistent constipation that doesn't get better with the usual treatments not feeding well or gaining much weight If your child develops a bowel infection (enterocolitis), they may also have a high temperature (fever) and watery, foul-smelling diarrhoea. When to get medical advice Visit your GP if your child develops the symptoms described above. Hirschsprung's disease can be serious if left untreated, so it's important to get help as soon as possible. If your GP suspects the condition, they will refer you to hospital for tests to confirm the diagnosis. How Hirschsprung's disease is diagnosed Your child's tummy will usually be examined and sometimes a rectal examination may be carried out. This is where a doctor or nurse inserts a finger into the back passage (rectum) to feel for abnormalities. If Hirschsprung's disease is suspected, an X-ray can be done to show a blockage and bulge in the bowel. The diagnosis can be confirmed by doing a rectal biopsy, which involves inserting a small instrument into your child's bottom to remove a tiny sample of the affected bowel. This is then examined under the microscope to see if the nerve cells are missing. What causes Hirschsprung's disease? The muscles of the bowel are controlled by nerve cells called ganglion cells. In Hirschsprung's disease, these ganglion cells are missing from a section at the end of bowel, extending up from the anus, the opening in the bottom that poo passes through. For some reason, the cells didn't develop in that area when the baby was growing in the womb. It's not clear why this happens, but it's not thought to be caused by anything the mother did while she was pregnant. A number of genes are associated with Hirschsprung's disease and it does sometimes run in families. If you've had a child with it before, you're more likely to have another child with it. The condition is occasionally part of a wider genetic condition, such as Down's syndrome, but most cases aren't. Treatments for Hirschsprung's disease All children with Hirschsprung's disease will need surgery. As they wait for surgery, they may need to: stop having milk feeds and instead be given fluids directly into a vein have a tube passed through their nose and into their stomach to drain away any fluid and air collecting in it have regular bowel washouts, where a thin tube is inserted into their bottom and warm salt water is used to soften and flush out the trapped stools take antibiotics if they have enterocolitis Your child may need to stay in hospital during this time, or you may be able to look after them at home. Your doctor will advise you about this. Surgery Most children will have the \"pull-through\" operation, where the affected section of bowel is removed and the remaining healthy sections of bowel are joined together. This will usually be done when they're around three months old. If your child isn't well enough to have this procedure \u2013 for example, because they have enterocolitis or a severe blockage \u2013 they may have it in two stages. A few days after birth, the surgeon will divert the bowel through a temporary opening (stoma) made in the tummy. This procedure is called a colostomy formation. Stools will pass directly out of the opening into a pouch worn on your child's body until they're well enough to have another procedure to remove the affected section of bowel, close the opening, and join the healthy sections of bowel together. This is usually done at around three months of age. These procedures can be done using either: laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery \u2013 this involves inserting surgical instruments through tiny cuts  open surgery \u2013 where a larger cut is made in your child's tummy Speak to your surgeon about the best option for your child. Risks of surgery No surgery is risk-free. There's a small chance of: bleeding during or after the operation the bowel becoming infected (enterocolitis) bowel contents leaking into the body, which could lead to serious infection (peritonitis) if not treated quickly the bowel becoming narrowed or blocked again, requiring further surgery Recovery from surgery Your child will probably need to stay in hospital for a few days after surgery. They'll be given pain-relieving medicine to make them comfortable and fluids into a vein until they can manage food. No special diet is needed once you get home, but it's important they drink plenty of fluids as they recover.  Your child should recover well and their bowels should function normally after surgery. At first they'll probably have a sore bottom when they poo. It can help to leave their bottom open to the air whenever possible, and use baby oil to gently clean their bottom as well as nappy cream after each change. Call your doctor immediately if your child develops problems such as a swollen belly, fever, or foul-smelling diarrhoea. Outlook for Hirschsprung's disease Most children are able to pass stools normally and have a normal functioning bowel after surgery, although they may take a bit longer to toilet train. Some may experience persistent constipation and need to follow a high-fibre diet and take laxatives. Your doctor will advise about this treatment. A small number of children have problems controlling their bowels (bowel incontinence), which can last until they're a teenager and be very distressing.  Speak to your GP if this is a problem. You can also read advice about soiling in children. Information about your child If your child has been affected by Hirschsprung's disease, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Many people assume agoraphobia is simply a fear of open spaces, but it's actually a more complex condition. Someone with agoraphobia may be scared of: travelling on public transport visiting a shopping centre leaving home If someone with agoraphobia finds themselves in a stressful situation, they'll usually experience the symptoms of a panic attack, such as: rapid heartbeat rapid breathing (hyperventilating) feeling hot and sweaty feeling sick They'll avoid situations that cause anxiety and may only leave the house with a friend or partner. They'll order groceries online rather than going to the supermarket. This change in behaviour is known as avoidance. Read more about the symptoms of agoraphobia. What causes agoraphobia? Agoraphobia usually develops as a complication of panic disorder, an anxiety disorder involving panic attacks and moments of intense fear. It can arise by associating panic attacks with the places or situations where they occurred and then avoiding them. A minority of people with agoraphobia have no history of panic attacks. In these cases, their fear may be related to issues like a fear of crime, terrorism, illness, or being in an accident. Traumatic events, such as bereavement, may contribute towards agoraphobia, as well as certain genes inherited from your parents. Read more about the possible causes of agoraphobia. Diagnosing agoraphobia Speak to your GP if you think you may be affected by agoraphobia. It should be possible to arrange a telephone consultation if you don't feel ready to visit your GP in person. Your GP will ask you to describe your symptoms, how often they occur, and in what situations. It's very important you tell them how you've been feeling and how your symptoms are affecting you. Your GP may ask you the following questions: Do you find leaving the house stressful? Are there certain places or situations you have to avoid? Do you have any avoidance strategies to help you cope with your symptoms, such as relying on others to shop for you? It can sometimes be difficult to talk about your feelings, emotions, and personal life, but try not to feel anxious or embarrassed. Your GP needs to know as much as possible about your symptoms to make the correct diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment. Read more about diagnosing agoraphobia. Treating agoraphobia With psychological treatment (talking therapies), most people with agoraphobia will make significant improvements, particularly if the three steps described below are followed. A stepwise approach is usually recommended for treating agoraphobia and any underlying panic disorder: step one \u2013 educate yourself about your condition, possible lifestyle changes you can make, and self-help techniques to help relieve symptoms step two \u2013 enrol yourself on a guided self-help programme step three \u2013 more intensive treatments, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or medication Lifestyle changes may include taking regular exercise, eating more healthily, and avoiding alcohol, drugs and drinks that contain caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola. Self-help techniques that can help during a panic attack include staying where you are, focusing on something that's non-threatening and visible, and slow, deep breathing. If your agoraphobia fails to respond to these treatment methods, your GP may suggest trying a guided self-help programme. This involves working through self-help manuals that cover the types of issues you might be facing, along with practical advice about how to deal with them. Medication may be recommended if self-help techniques and lifestyle changes aren't effective in controlling your symptoms. You'll usually be prescribed a course of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are also used to treat anxiety and depression. In severe cases of agoraphobia, medication can be used in combination with other types of treatment, such as CBT and relaxation therapy. Read more about treating agoraphobia. Outlook Around a third of people with agoraphobia eventually achieve a complete cure and remain free from symptoms. Around half experience an improvement in symptoms, but they may have periods when their symptoms become more troublesome \u2013 for example, if they feel stressed. Despite treatment, about one in five people with agoraphobia continue to experience troublesome symptoms.  How common is agoraphobia? In the UK, up to 2 people in 100 have panic disorder. It's thought around a third will go on to develop agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is twice as common in women as men. It usually starts between the ages of 18 and 35.

Treatments for every phobia are available through the NHS or other medical organisations. However, there are no quick fixes. There\u2019s no one way of coping with specific phobias that is guaranteed to work. Different strategies work for different people. Nicky Lidbetter, chief executive of Anxiety UK, says people are sometimes reluctant to see their doctor about a phobia, because they're embarrassed by it. \u201CThey may think they don\u2019t want to waste their GP\u2019s time with something as trivial as a phobia,\u201D she says. \u201CBut there really is nothing trivial about it.\u201D Your GP can refer you to your local primary care mental health team (PCMHT), which provides support and treatment for people with common mental health problems. The PCMHT brings together counsellors, social workers and psychologists. It can offer one-to-one consultations, where you will be given self-help material and some basic therapy. \u201CIt\u2019s important that people know these teams exist because they are a great resource,\u201D says Lidbetter. If you don\u2019t want to be seen by your GP, you can contact one of the organisations specialising in the treatment of phobias, such as Anxiety UK. They can help you find treatments that aren\u2019t available on the NHS. Getting help for phobias To cure certain phobias, treatment consists of some exposure to the things you are afraid of, in small manageable steps, to reduce your anxiety. Some phobia organisations offer clinical hypnotherapy, which isn\u2019t available on the NHS. \u201CYou\u2019re not hypnotised in the same way that you see on TV shows,\u201D says Lidbetter. \"You\u2019re put in a relaxed state of mind and asked to see yourself confronting your fear with confidence. \u201CIt can be useful for people whose anxiety is so acute that they\u2019re not yet ready for behaviour therapy,\u201D she adds. For people with severe specific phobias, the most effective treatment is likely to be cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). CBT involves looking at your problems and working out ways of changing negative thoughts or behaviours. Therapists often set clients homework to do in between sessions, which may include carrying out activities such as monitoring thoughts and feelings throughout the week, and entering these into a thought diary. \u201CWith phobias, what you do in between the therapy sessions is as important as the sessions themselves,\u201D says Lidbetter. Tackling complex phobias With complex phobias, such as social phobia and agoraphobia, lifestyle habits may be aggravating anxiety symptoms. Tackling diet, fitness and sleep can help as much as therapy in treating the phobia. \"You need to tackle complex phobia from several fronts to get the maximum benefit,\u201D says Lidbetter. \u201CWhen they're anxious, people often eat or drink the wrong things, such as coffee, which can aggravate anxiety. It\u2019s also important to get enough sleep and take regular exercise.\u201D Lidbetter says that exercising uses up excess adrenaline, a hormone that causes your heart to beat faster, and can therefore worsen anxiety symptoms. With complex phobias it\u2019s important to get help as soon as possible. \"The longer you leave it untreated, the more entrenched it becomes,\" says Lidbetter. Again, CBT is recommended, but it doesn\u2019t work for everyone, and should be used as one of a combination of treatments. To speed up access to treatment, the Department of Health has approved computer-based CBT, for use at home or at a medical or community centre. FearFighter is a course of therapy delivered on the internet, available only through medical referral, for patients suffering from panic and phobias. There is also a range of internet packages that can be very useful for those not requiring intense treatment, but who would like to improve the management of their phobia and anxiety. Medication for phobias Medication is only recommended in the short term, as it's best to see if other techniques, such as talking therapy, will work. \u201CMedication is also worth trying in combination with other therapies, if simple self-help techniques and lifestyle changes prove to be ineffective,\u201D says Lidbetter. The three main types of medicine that are used to treat anxiety issues, including phobias, are antidepressants, tranquillisers and beta-blockers. Self-help groups are a good way of getting in touch with people with similar problems. They will be able to understand what you're going through and may be able to suggest helpful ways of coping. Members learn how to face up to fears together in a gradual, controlled way, so that eventually the anxiety should decrease. \"To have other people to help you along the way is really useful,\" says Lidbetter. \"People share coping strategies and techniques. To know there are others out there experiencing the same feelings is reassuring. \"It doesn\u2019t matter how many books you read, you don\u2019t get the experience of living with a phobia that you would get from speaking to a real person.\" For more information, visit our Health A-Z section on phobia treatments.

'Agranulocytosis' and 'neutropenia' are terms often used to describe a deficiency of these cells. However, the two terms shouldn't be used interchangeably, as they describe slightly different conditions. agranulocytosis is the term used when the bone marrow (soft tissue inside bone) fails to make enough granulocytes neutropenia is the term used when the bone marrow fails to make enough of a specific group of granulocytes called neutrophils Although these conditions are slightly different, they tend to share many similar causes and symptoms, and are often treated in a similar way. What causes agranulocytosis and neutropenia? Agranulocytosis and neutropenia usually occur later in life, as the result of another condition or treatment (acquired), but can sometimes be present from birth (congenital). Depending on the cause, your white blood cell count may recover over time. However, in some cases, the problem can be persistent. Acquired agranulocytosis and neutropenia Common causes of acquired agranulocytosis or neutropenia include: chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant (or preparation for a bone marrow transplant) certain medications \u2013 including some anti-psychotics and some medications for an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) an autoimmune disorder (where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues) \u2013 such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis a bone marrow disease \u2013 such as myelodysplasia (where blood cells do not develop properly) or leukaemia certain infections \u2013 including HIV and hepatitis Congenital agranulocytosis and neutropenia Congenital agranulocytosis or neutropenia can be caused by several rare genetic faults (altered genes) that may be passed on to a child by one or both of his or her parents. Individuals of Afro-Caribbean descent often have a naturally slightly lower neutrophil count than those of other ethnic origins, but this is entirely normal and does not lead to any health problems. Signs and symptoms Most people with agranulocytosis or neutropenia will not have any obvious symptoms. However, these conditions may mean you are more vulnerable to picking up infections because you don't have enough white blood cells to fight germs effectively. Symptoms associated with an infection can include: a high temperature (fever) chills and shivering headaches sweating facial flushing a sore throat or mouth mouth ulcers swollen glands a lack of energy flu-like symptoms In some people, infections can spread quickly through the body and can lead to a life-threatening condition called sepsis. In addition to some of the above symptoms, sepsis can also cause a fast heartbeat and fast breathing. Seeking medical advice Most people at risk of agranulocytosis or neutropenia should already be aware of signs to look out for, and will have been told what to do if they experience them. For example, if you have been having chemotherapy, your cancer care team may have given you a telephone number you can call if you experience any problems, such as a high temperature. If you know you are at risk of these white blood cell deficiencies and you start to feel unwell, it's important to contact your doctor or care team immediately. Sepsis is a medical emergency and should be assessed by a doctor in hospital as soon as possible so appropriate treatment can be started quickly. Diagnosing and managing agranulocytosis and neutropenia If your doctor suspects you have agranulocytosis or neutropenia, they will carry out a blood test to check the level of white blood cells in your blood. If one of these conditions is diagnosed, the treatment and advice offered to you will depend on the cause and severity of your condition. Reducing your infection risk You will often be given some advice about ways you can reduce your risk of infection while your white blood cell count is low. This may include: avoiding undercooked and some raw foods that could lead to food poisoning avoiding close contact with people you know have an infection making sure you store and prepare food properly maintaining good personal hygiene, such as washing your hands with soap and warm water regularly Read more about food safety and preventing germs from spreading. Antibiotics If you develop an infection, you will usually need to be treated with antibiotics because your body will not be able to fight the infection itself. Depending on the severity of the infection, you may be given antibiotic tablets to take at home, or you may need to have antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenously) while in hospital. In some cases, you may be given a course of low-dose antibiotics to take to stop infections developing in the first place. G-CSF injections Some people may need injections of a medication called G-CSF (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor), which can stimulate the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells. Granulocyte infusions In very rare cases, you may need to go to hospital to have a type of blood transfusion where you are just given granulocyte cells. Granulocytes for transfusion are ideally taken from a donor who is a friend or relative. The donor is given corticosteroid medication plus G-CSF, which helps them to produce more granulocytes and increases the number of these in their blood. The donor's blood is then removed and the white cells are separated out for transfusion. The transfusion is usually given through a tiny plastic tube called a cannula, which is inserted into a vein in your arm. Bone marrow transplant In particularly severe cases, you may need a bone marrow transplant (stem cell transplant) to replace your damaged bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells taken from a donor. White blood cells play a key role in fighting infection  Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a treatment for cancer where medication is used to kill cancerous cells.

This can lead to many different symptoms depending on where the blockage occurs. It's one of the leading causes of death among divers. An air or gas embolism can happen when a scuba diver surfaces too quickly from any depth. This can cause air to escape into the blood vessels from the lungs (pulmonary barotrauma) or bubbles of nitrogen to form in the blood vessels (decompression illness, or \"the bends\"). An embolism can develop in an artery or vein. When an air bubble travels along an artery, it moves through a system of blood vessels that gradually become narrower. At some point, the bubble may block a small artery and cut off the blood supply to a particular area of the body. Bubbles in the veins travel around the body and can cause breathing difficulties when they reach the lungs. How serious is it? The seriousness of the blockage depends on which part of the body the affected blood vessel supplies blood to and the size of the air bubble. For example, an air embolism in: the arteries to the brain can cause immediate loss of consciousness and may lead to seizures (fits) or a stroke \u2013 it can also cause confusion, dizziness and slurred speech the coronary arteries (which lead to the heart) may cause a heart attack or an abnormal heart rhythm a blood vessel to the lungs may cause a pulmonary embolism These conditions are very serious and can be fatal, particularly if an air embolism is not recognised and treated promptly. Even with treatment, some people who survive are left with permanent brain damage, although this is very rare. Warning signs Divers should always be carefully monitored by their colleagues and supervisors so any air or gas embolism can be immediately identified and treated. Signs and symptoms of an air embolism can include: joint or muscle pains low blood pressure, which may cause dizziness  an irregular heartbeat breathlessness and fast breathing blurred vision chest pain strong feelings of anxiety and itching of the skin a faint blue tone to the skin (cyanosis) bloody froth from the mouth paralysis or weakness, possibly of one or more limbs seizures (fits) loss of consciousness If a scuba diver develops these symptoms within 10 to 20 minutes of surfacing, they probably have an air embolism and should be given 100% oxygen and transferred to hospital as soon as possible, preferably one with a recompression chamber. Treating air embolisms If a diver develops an air embolism, the only effective treatment is immediate recompression treatment in a special pressurised room called a hyperbaric chamber. The diver should be given 100% oxygen and laid horizontally until they reach the hyperbaric chamber. Recompression treatment involves lying in a hyperbaric chamber, usually for several hours, and breathing a mixture of gases and oxygen under pressure. The high pressure can restore normal blood flow and oxygen to the body's tissues and reduce the size of the air bubbles in the body. In cases of decompression sickness, the pressure forces the bubbles of nitrogen to dissolve back into the bloodstream. After recompression, pressure is reduced gradually to allow the gases to leave the body without worsening the problem, similar to surfacing slowly from a dive. Treatment might be continued for several days depending on the severity of symptoms. Preventing an air embolism while diving The following advice can help reduce your risk of developing an air or gas embolism when diving. Limit the depth and duration of your dives. Come up to the surface slowly and always perform safety stops to allow any air in your tissues and blood vessels to escape safely. Use a dive computer or dive tables, and don't dive again if you have broken these rules until you have had a suitable time at the surface. Don't dive with a cold, cough or chest infection. Avoid rigorous exercise before, during and after a dive. Make sure you're well hydrated before diving. If planning several dives, leave adequate surface intervals between dives to allow the nitrogen to leave your body. After diving, wait for 24 hours before flying or going to a higher altitude. If in doubt, contact a dive professional or doctor, who can provide further advice. Other causes of air embolisms Air embolisms also occur during surgery or other medical procedures, but this is rare. In hospitals and health centres, care should be taken to prevent this. For example: before injections, air should be removed from syringes and intravenous lines catheters or other tubes inserted into the body should be inserted and removed using a technique that minimises the possibility of air getting into the blood vessels patients should be closely monitored to help ensure air bubbles don't form in blood vessels during surgery Air embolisms resulting from surgery, anaesthesia or other medical procedures can be difficult to treat. Treatment is usually needed to support the heart, blood vessels and lungs.

A child born with AIS is genetically male, but the external appearance of their genitals may be female or somewhere between male and female. Someone with AIS may benefit from psychological support, and in some cases may have treatment to alter the appearance of their genitals. Most people born with the condition are unable to have children, but they'll otherwise be perfectly healthy and able to lead a normal life. What causes AIS? AIS is caused by a genetic fault that's usually passed on to a child by their mother. This genetic fault means that, despite being genetically male, the body doesn't respond to testosterone (the male sex hormone) properly and male sexual development doesn't happen as normal. This means the penis doesn't form or is underdeveloped. The child's genitals may appear female, or between male and female, but they don't have a womb or ovaries and have fully or partially undescended testicles. Women who carry the genetic fault won't have AIS themselves, but there's a one in four chance each child they have will be born with the condition. Read more about the causes of AIS. Types of AIS There are two main types of AIS, which are determined by how much the body is able to use testosterone. These are: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) \u2013 where testosterone has no effect on sexual development, so the genitals are entirely female partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) \u2013 where testosterone still has some effect on sexual development, so the genitals are often between male and female PAIS is usually noticed at birth because the genitals appear different. CAIS can be more difficult to spot, as the genitals usually look normal for a girl. It's often not diagnosed until puberty, when periods don't start and pubic and underarm hair doesn't develop. Read more about the symptoms of AIS and diagnosing AIS. Living with AIS Children with AIS and their parents are supported by a team of specialists, who will offer ongoing care and support. They will help you decide whether to raise your child as a girl or a boy while they're still very young. Most children with CAIS are raised as girls, while those with PAIS can be brought up either as girls or boys. It's up to you as a parent, with help from specialists, to decide what you think is in the best interests of your child. Once you've decided, you can learn about the treatments available that can help make your child's body look more consistent with the chosen gender and help them develop more naturally. This may involve surgery to alter the appearance or function of their genitals, and hormone treatment to encourage female or male development during puberty. Read more about how AIS is treated. Support and advice You and your child will be offered psychological support to help you understand and cope with the diagnosis of AIS. Children may not need this while they're very young, but they usually do as they get older. You'll be given advice about how and when to discuss the condition with your child. You may also find it helpful to get in touch with a support group, such as the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (AISSG) and DSD Families. Information about your child If your child has AIS, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Gender identity and gender dysphoria Most children with AIS grow up to feel they are the gender their parents chose to raise them as. This feeling is known as their gender identity. In a few cases, older children and adults with AIS feel their gender identity doesn't match the gender they've been raised as. This is known as gender dysphoria. People with gender dysphoria often have a desire to live as a member of the opposite sex, and may want treatment to make their physical appearance more consistent with their gender identity. If your child is diagnosed with AIS, you should be told about the issues of gender identity that could arise as your child gets older.

People with albinism have a reduced amount of melanin or no melanin at all, which can cause characteristic signs and symptoms often obvious from birth. Depending on the amount of melanin the person has, they may have very pale hair, skin and eyes, although some people with albinism can have brown or ginger hair and skin that can tan. People with albinism also usually have a number of eye conditions, such as: problems with eyesight \u2013 they may benefit from wearing glasses, although these can't usually fully correct vision nystagmus (involuntary eye movements) photophobia (sensitivity to light) Read more about the symptoms of albinism and diagnosing albinism. What causes albinism? In albinism, cells that produce melanin do not work properly because of inherited genetic mutations (faulty genes). There are a number of faulty genes that can cause albinism, and these are passed onto a child by their parents. Read more about the causes of albinism. Who is affected It is estimated that about one in every 17,000 people has some form of albinism. The condition generally affects both sexes equally, although there is one type \u2013 known as ocular albinism (which mainly affects the eyes) \u2013 that is more common in males. Albinism can affect people of all ethnic groups. Treatment for people with albinism Albinism itself does not need treatment, but the associated skin and eye problems it can cause often do. A child with albinism will need regular eye tests and it is likely they will need to wear glasses or contact lenses to correct vision problems such as short-sightedness, long-sightedness or astigmatism. Those with albinism will also need to take extra care in the sun. Without melanin, ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight can easily damage their skin (sunburn) and increase their risk of developing skin cancer. Read more about treating albinism. Outlook Albinism is a lifelong condition, but it doesn't get worse over time. A person with albinism\u2019s vision is unlikely to ever reach normal levels, even with glasses or contact lenses, and a child with the condition will often need extra support at school. A child with albinism may also need support to help them deal with any bullying they may experience because they look different. However, there is usually no reason why a person with albinism cannot otherwise do well in normal schooling, further education and employment. Information about you If you have albinism, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).

Alcohol consumption is measured in units. A unit of alcohol is 10ml of pure alcohol, which is about: half a pint of normal-strength lager a single measure (25ml) of spirits A small glass (125ml) of wine contains about 1.5 units of alcohol. Lower-risk limits To keep your risk of alcohol-related harm low, the NHS recommends: not regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it's best to spread this evenly over three or more days if you're trying to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, it's a good idea to have several alcohol-free days each week Regular or frequent drinking means drinking alcohol most weeks. The risk to your health is increased by drinking any amount of alcohol on a regular basis. Risks of alcohol misuse Short-term The short-term risks of alcohol misuse include: accidents and injuries requiring hospital treatment, such as a head injury violent behaviour and being a victim of violence unprotected sex that could potentially lead to unplanned pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) loss of personal possessions, such as wallets, keys or mobile phones alcohol poisoning \u2013 this may lead to vomiting, seizures (fits) and falling unconscious People who binge drink (drink heavily over a short period of time) are more likely to behave recklessly and are at greater risk of being in an accident. Long-term Persistent alcohol misuse increases your risk of serious health conditions, including: heart disease stroke liver disease liver cancer and bowel cancer mouth cancer  pancreatitis  As well as causing serious health problems, long-term alcohol misuse can lead to social problems, such as unemployment, divorce, domestic abuse and homelessness. If someone loses control over their drinking and has an excessive desire to drink, it's known as dependent drinking (alcoholism). Dependent drinking usually affects a person's quality of life and relationships, but they may not always find it easy to see or accept this.  Severely dependent drinkers are often able to tolerate very high levels of alcohol in amounts that would dangerously affect or even kill some people. A dependent drinker usually experiences physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms if they suddenly cut down or stop drinking, including: hand tremors \u2013 \"the shakes\" sweating seeing things that aren't real (visual hallucinations) depression anxiety difficulty sleeping (insomnia) This often leads to \"relief drinking\" to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

They'll be able to discuss the services and treatments available.  Your alcohol intake may be assessed using tests, such as: the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (PDF, 224kb) \u2013 a widely used screening test that can help determine whether you need to change your drinking habits the Fast Alcohol Screening Test \u2013 a simpler test to check whether your drinking has reached dangerous levels the Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire \u2013 this helps identify how severely dependent on alcohol you may be As well as the NHS, there are a number of charities and support groups across the UK that provide support and advice for people with an alcohol misuse problem. For example, you may want to contact: Alcohol Concern \u2013 runs the national drink helpline, Drinkline on 0300 123 1110 Alcoholics Anonymous \u2013 helpline 0845 769 7555 Al-Anon Family Groups \u2013 helpline 020 7403 0888 For a full list of charities and support groups, see our page on alcohol support. Treating alcohol misuse How alcohol misuse is treated depends on how much alcohol a person is drinking. Treatment options include: counselling \u2013 including self-help groups and talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) medication detoxification \u2013 this involves a nurse or doctor supporting you to safely stop drinking; this can be done by helping you slowly cut down over time or by giving you medicines to prevent withdrawal symptoms There are two main types of medicines to help people stop drinking. The first is to help stop withdrawal symptoms, and is given in reducing doses over a short period of time. The most common of these medicines is chlordiazapoxide (Librium). The second is a medication to reduce any urge you may have to drink. The most common medications used for this are acamprosate and naltrexone. These are both given at a fixed dose, and you'll usually be on them for 6 to 12 months. Read more about the treatment options for alcohol misuse.

Being poisoned by alcohol can damage your health or even put your life in danger. It's important to avoid misusing alcohol and to be aware of how much you're drinking and the effect this could have on your body. This topic covers: Signs and symptoms When to seek medical help Treatment in hospital Dangers of alcohol poisoning How alcohol poisoning occurs The effects of alcohol Recommended alcohol limits Signs and symptoms of alcohol poisoning The signs and symptoms of alcohol poisoning include: confusion severely slurred speech loss of co-ordination vomiting irregular or slow breathing hypothermia (pale or blue-tinged skin caused by low body temperature) stupor (being conscious but unresponsive) passing out and being unconscious In the most severe cases, alcohol poisoning can lead to coma, brain damage and death. When to seek medical help If you suspect alcohol poisoning, dial 999 immediately to request an ambulance. While you're waiting: try to keep them sitting up and awake give them water if they can drink it if they've passed out, lie them on their side in the recovery position and check they're breathing properly keep them warm stay with them and monitor their symptoms Never leave a person alone to 'sleep it off'. The level of alcohol in a person's blood can continue to rise for up to 30-40 minutes after their last drink. This can cause their symptoms to suddenly become much more severe. You also shouldn't give them coffee or any more alcohol, put them under a cold shower or walk them around. These won't help someone 'sober up' and may even be dangerous. How alcohol poisoning is treated in hospital In hospital, the person will be carefully monitored until the alcohol has left their system. If treatment is required, this may include: inserting a tube into their mouth and windpipe (intubation) \u2013 to open the airway, remove any blockages and help with breathing fitting an intravenous drip, which goes directly into a vein \u2013 to top up their water, blood sugar and vitamin levels fitting a catheter (thin tube) to their bladder \u2013 to drain urine straight into a bag so they don't wet themselves Dangers of alcohol poisoning If a person is poisoned by alcohol they could: choke on their vomit stop breathing have a heart attack inhale vomit, leading to fatal lung damage become severely dehydrated, which can cause permanent brain damage in extreme cases develop more severe hypothermia have seizures (fits) as a result of lowered blood sugar levels Repeated vomiting and retching can lead to the vomiting of blood as a result of a torn blood vessel (Mallory-Weiss tear) at the junction of the stomach and gullet. Other related risks Drinking too much alcohol can affect a person's judgement and put them in situations where their health and safety are at risk. For example, they may: have an accident or get injured become involved in violent or antisocial behaviour have unsafe sex, which can lead to an unplanned pregnancy or a sexually transmitted infection (STI) lose personal possessions How alcohol poisoning occurs Every time you drink alcohol, your liver has to filter it out of your blood. Alcohol is absorbed quickly into your body (much quicker than food), but the body can only process around one unit of alcohol an hour. If you drink a lot of alcohol over a short space of time, such as on a night out, your body won't have time to process it all. Alcohol poisoning can also occur if a person drinks household products that contain alcohol \u2013 children sometimes drink these by accident. The amount of alcohol in your bloodstream \u2013 known as your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) \u2013 will rise. The effects of alcohol Around 1-2 units your heart rate will speed up and your blood vessels will expand you get the warm, sociable feeling associated with moderate drinking Around 4-6 units your decision making and judgement will start to be affected, making you lose your inhibitions and become more reckless the cells in your nervous system will start to be affected, making you feel lightheaded your co-ordination will be affected and your reaction time may be slower Around 8-9 units your reaction times will be much slower your speech will be slurred your vision will begin to lose focus your liver won't be able to remove all of the alcohol overnight, so it's likely you'll wake up with a hangover At this stage you should seriously consider not drinking any more alcohol. If you do: Around 10-12 units your co-ordination will be seriously impaired, placing you at high risk of having an accident you may stagger around or feel unstable on your feet you'll feel drowsy or dizzy the amount of alcohol in your body will begin to reach toxic (poisonous) levels you may need to go to the toilet more often as your body attempts to quickly pass the alcohol out of your body in your urine you'll be dehydrated in the morning, and probably have a severe headache the excess alcohol in your system may upset your digestive system, leading to nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or indigestion More than 12 units you're at high risk of developing alcohol poisoning, particularly if you're drinking lots of units in a short space of time the alcohol can begin to interfere with the automatic functions of your body, such as your breathing, heart rate and gag reflex you're at risk of losing consciousness Recommended alcohol limits If you drink most weeks, to reduce your risk of harming your health: men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over three days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week One unit of alcohol is equivalent to: half a pint of lower-strength lager, beer or cider (ABV 3.6%) a single small shot of spirits (25ml, ABV 40%) Read more about alcohol units. You should also avoid binge drinking as it's dangerous and puts you at risk of alcohol poisoning. Read more about drinking and alcohol including tips on cutting down on your drinking.

Alcohol is a diuretic (meaning it removes fluids from the body), so drinking too much can lead to dehydration. Dehydration is what causes many of the symptoms of a hangover. Alcohol can upset your stomach and give you a bad night's sleep. You may still have some alcohol in your system the next morning.  Cure myth Hangover cures are generally a myth. There are no cures for a hangover. There are tips for avoiding hangovers and for easing the symptoms if you have one. The best way to avoid a hangover is not to drink. If you decide to drink: limit how much you drink in single session drink more slowly drink with food alternate with water or non-alcoholic drinks To avoid a hangover, don't drink more than you know your body can cope with. If you're not sure how much that is, be careful.  To reduce the risk of harming your health if you drink most weeks: men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over three days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week Know your units You can keep track of how many units you're consuming using the One You Drinks Tracker app available from iTunes and Google Play.  A large glass of wine, for instance, contains around three units. In one evening, that can quickly add up to a lot more than you intended to drink. Here are some examples: a can of standard lager, beer or bitter \u2013 1.8 units  a pint of standard lager, beer or bitter \u2013 2.3 units a small glass of wine (125ml) \u2013 1.5 units a large glass of wine (250ml) \u2013 3 units  a measure of spirits (25ml) \u2013 1 unit   Follow these tips to keep hangovers away: Don't drink on an empty stomach. Before you go out, have a meal that includes carbohydrates (such as pasta or rice) or fats. The food will help slow down the body's absorption of alcohol. Don't drink dark-coloured drinks if you've found that you're sensitive to them. They contain natural chemicals called congeners (impurities), which irritate blood vessels and tissue in the brain and can make a hangover worse. Drink water or non-fizzy soft drinks in between each alcoholic drink. Carbonated (fizzy) drinks speed up the absorption of alcohol into your system. Drink a pint or so of water before you go to sleep. Keep a glass of water by the bed to sip if you wake up during the night.  The morning after If you wake up the next morning feeling terrible, you probably didn't follow this advice. Although there are no real cures for hangovers, there are ways to ease the symptoms. Treatment involves rehydrating the body so it can deal with the painful symptoms (though the best time to rehydrate is before going to sleep). Over-the-counter painkillers can help with headaches and muscle cramps. Paracetamol-based remedies are usually preferable, as aspirin may further irritate the stomach and increase nausea and sickness. Sugary foods may help you feel less trembly. In some cases, an antacid may be needed to settle your stomach first. Bouillon soup, a thin vegetable-based broth, is a good source of vitamins and minerals, which can top-up depleted resources. Its main advantage is that it's easy for a fragile stomach to digest. You can replace lost fluids by drinking bland liquids that are easy on the digestive system, such as water, soda water and isotonic drinks (available in most shops). \"Hair of the dog\" (drinking more alcohol) does not help. Drinking in the morning is a risky habit, and you may simply be delaying the appearance of symptoms until the alcohol wears off again. If you've had a heavy drinking session, hangover or not, doctors advise that you wait at least 48 hours before drinking any more alcohol, to give your body tissues time to recover. Sometimes, of course, a hangover makes that advice easier to follow.

There are several stages of severity and a range of associated symptoms. ARLD doesn't usually cause any symptoms until the liver has been severely damaged. When this happens, symptoms can include: feeling sick weight loss loss of appetite yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) swelling in the ankles and tummy confusion or drowsiness vomiting blood or passing blood in your stools This means ARLD is frequently diagnosed during tests for other conditions, or at a stage of advanced liver damage. If you regularly drink alcohol to excess, tell your GP so they can check if your liver is damaged. Read more about: symptoms of ARLD diagnosing ARLD Alcohol and the liver With the exception of the brain, the liver is the most complex organ in the body. Its functions include: filtering toxins from the blood aiding digestion of food regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels helping fight infection and disease The liver is very resilient and capable of regenerating itself. Each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die. The liver can develop new cells, but prolonged alcohol misuse (drinking too much) over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. This can result in serious and permanent damage to your liver. ARLD is very common in the UK \u2013 the number of people with the condition has been increasing over the last few decades as a result of increasing levels of alcohol misuse. Read more about the causes of ARLD. Stages of ARLD There are three main stages of ARLD, although there's often an overlap between each stage. These stages are explained below. Alcoholic fatty liver disease Drinking a large amount of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver. This is called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of ARLD. Fatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, but it's an important warning sign that you're drinking at a harmful level. Fatty liver disease is reversible. If you stop drinking alcohol for two weeks, your liver should return to normal. Alcoholic hepatitis Alcoholic hepatitis \u2013 which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis \u2013 is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. When this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they're damaging their liver through alcohol. Less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drinking). The liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently. Severe alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious and life-threatening illness. Many people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage. Cirrhosis Cirrhosis is a stage of ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred. Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms. It's generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy. A person who has alcohol-related cirrhosis and doesn't stop drinking has a less than 50% chance of living for at least five more years. How ARLD is treated There's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life. This reduces the risk of further damage to your liver and gives it the best chance of recovering. If a person is dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult. However, support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol support services. A liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and doesn't improve when you stop drinking alcohol. You'll only be considered for a liver transplant if you've developed complications of cirrhosis, despite having stopped drinking. All liver transplant units require a person to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of their life. Read more about treating ARLD. Complications Death rates linked to ARLD have risen considerably over the last few decades. Alcohol is now one of the most common causes of death in the UK, along with smoking and high blood pressure. Life-threatening complications of ARLD include: internal (variceal) bleeding build-up of toxins in the brain (encephalopathy) fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) with associated kidney failure liver cancer Read more about the complications of ARLD. Preventing ARLD The most effective way to prevent ARLD is to stop drinking alcohol or stick to the recommended limits: men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over three days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week A unit of alcohol is equal to about half a pint of normal-strength lager or a pub measure (25ml) of spirits. Even if you've been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping your alcohol intake will have important short- and long-term benefits for your liver and overall health.

During a number of lessons you're taught to be more aware of your body, how to improve poor posture and move more efficiently. Teachers of the Alexander technique believe this helps get rid of tension in your body and relieves problems such as back pain, neck ache, sore shoulders and other musculoskeletal problems. Evidence suggests the technique has the potential to improve certain health conditions, but there are some claims made about the technique that haven\u2019t been scientifically tested (see Does it work? below). Key principles The main principles of the Alexander technique are: \"how you move, sit and stand affects how well you function\" \"the relationship of the head, neck and spine is fundamental to your ability to function optimally\" \"becoming more mindful of the way you go about your daily activities is necessary to make changes and gain benefit\" \"the mind and body work together intimately as one, each constantly influencing the other\" Teachers of the technique say that conditions such as backache and other sorts of long-term pain are often the result of misusing your body over a long period of time, such as moving inefficiently and standing or sitting with your weight unevenly distributed. The aim of the Alexander technique is to help you \"unlearn\" these bad habits and achieve a balanced, more naturally aligned body. Learning the Alexander technique The Alexander technique is taught by a qualified teacher (see Finding a teacher below for information about training) in one-to-one lessons. Lessons often take place in a studio, clinic or the teacher's house and usually last 30-45 minutes. You'll be asked to wear loose-fitting, comfortable clothing so you're able to move easily. The teacher will observe your movements and show you how to move, sit, lie down and stand with better balance and less strain. They'll use their hands to gently guide you in your movements, help you maintain a better relationship between your head, neck and spine, and to release muscle tension. You'll need to attend a number of lessons to learn the basic concepts of the Alexander technique. Often, around 20 or more weekly lessons are recommended. Teachers of the technique say you may see an improvement in aches and pains fairly soon after starting the lessons, but that you need to be committed to putting what you learn into practice and it may take a considerable amount of time to see the full benefits. The overall aim is to help you gain an understanding of the main principles involved so you can apply them to everyday life, allowing you to benefit from the technique without the need for frequent ongoing lessons. Does it work? Proponents of the Alexander technique often claim it can help people with a wide range of health conditions. Some of these claims are supported by scientific evidence, but some have not yet been properly tested. There's evidence suggesting the Alexander technique can help people with: long-term back pain \u2013 lessons in the technique may lead to reduced back pain-associated disability and reduce how often you feel pain for up to a year or more long-term neck pain \u2013 lessons in the technique may lead to reduced neck pain and associated disability for up to a year or more Parkinson's disease \u2013 lessons in the technique may help you carry out everyday tasks more easily and improve how you feel about your condition If you have one of these conditions and are considering trying the Alexander technique, it's a good idea to speak to your GP or specialist first to check if it might be suitable for you. Some research has also suggested the Alexander technique may improve general long-term pain, stammering and balance skills in elderly people to help them avoid falls. But the evidence in these areas is limited and more studies are needed. There's currently little evidence to suggest the Alexander technique can help improve other health conditions, including asthma, headaches, osteoarthritis, difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and stress. Availability and regulation Alexander technique lessons are mostly available privately. Each lesson usually costs around £35-50. However, in recent years some NHS trusts have started to offer Alexander technique lessons as part of their outpatient pain clinics. Ask your GP whether it's available through the NHS in your local area. Finding a teacher If you\u2019re thinking about trying the Alexander technique, it's important to choose a teacher who's experienced and qualified. There aren't currently any laws or regulations stating what training someone must have to teach the Alexander technique. Professional organisations offer courses (often for three years) and membership upon successful completion of the course. Teachers must meet certain requirements to register with these organisations and agree to comply with their code of ethics. In the UK, the main organisations for teachers of the Alexander technique are the: Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CHNC) Society of Teachers of the Alexander Technique (STAT) Interactive Teaching Method Association (ITM) Professional Association of Alexander Teachers (PAAT) Alexander Technique International (ATI) Of these, only the CHNC has been accredited by the Professional Standards Authority. Risks and limitations For most people, Alexander technique lessons are safe and pose no health risks. No manipulation of your body is involved, just gentle touch. However, the technique may not be suitable for certain people, such as those with: a specific spinal injury severe pain from a herniated (ruptured) disc severe spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spine) a fracture of the vertebrae (the bones in the spine) In such cases, specialist medical treatment will be needed. It's important to remember that most teachers of the Alexander technique aren't medical professionals. They do not diagnose, offer advice on or treat conditions that should be managed by a suitably qualified mainstream healthcare professional.

It results in a build-up of a chemical called homogentisic acid in the body. This can turn urine and parts of the body a dark colour and lead to a range of problems over time. Normally, amino acids are broken down in a series of chemical reactions. But in alkaptonuria, a substance produced along the way \u2013 homogentisic acid \u2013 cannot be broken down any further. This is because the enzyme that normally breaks it down doesn't work properly (enzymes are proteins that make chemical reactions happen). One of the earliest signs of the condition is dark-stained nappies, as homogentisic acid causes urine to turn black when exposed to air for a few hours. If this sign is missed or overlooked, the disorder may go unnoticed until adulthood, as there are usually no other noticeable symptoms until the person reaches their late 20s to early 30s. Signs and symptoms in adults Over the course of many years, homogentisic acid slowly builds up in tissues throughout the body. It can build up in almost any area of the body, including the cartilage, tendons, bones, nails, ears and heart. It stains the tissues dark and causes a wide range of problems. Joints and bones When a person with alkaptonuria reaches their 20s or 30s, they may start to experience joint problems. Typically, they'll have lower back pain and stiffness followed by knee, hip and shoulder pain. These are the early symptoms of osteoarthritis.  Eventually, cartilage (a tough, flexible tissue found throughout the body) may become brittle and break, leading to joint and spinal damage. Joint replacement operations are often needed. Ears and eyes An obvious sign of alkaptonuria in adults is thickening and blue-black discolouration of ear cartilage. This is known as ochronosis. The earwax may also be black or reddish-brown. Many people develop brown or grey spots on the whites of their eyes as well. Skin and nails Alkaptonuria can result in discoloured sweat, which can stain clothes and cause some people to have blue or black speckled areas of skin. Nails may also turn a bluish colour. The skin colour changes are most obvious on areas exposed to the sun and where sweat glands are found \u2013 the cheeks, forehead, armpits and genital area. Breathing difficulties If the bones and muscles around the lungs become stiff, it can prevent the chest expanding and lead to shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Heart, kidney and prostate problems Deposits of homogentisic acid around heart valves can cause them to harden and turn brittle and black. Blood vessels can also become stiff and weaken. This can lead to heart disease and may require heart valve replacements. The deposits can also lead to kidney stones, bladder stones and prostate stones. How alkaptonuria is inherited Each cell in the body contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. These carry the genes you inherit from your parents. One of each pair of chromosomes is inherited from each parent, which means (with the exception of the sex chromosomes) there are two copies of each gene in each cell. The gene involved in alkaptonuria is the HGD gene. This provides instructions for making an enzyme called homogentisate oxidase, which is needed to break down homogentisic acid. You need to inherit two copies of the faulty HGD gene (one from each parent) to develop alkaptonuria. The chances of this are slim, which is why the disease is very rare \u2013 affecting just 1 in 250,000 to 500,000 people worldwide, and only around 64 people in total in the UK. The parents of a person with alkaptonuria will often only carry one copy of the faulty gene themselves, which means they won't have any signs or symptoms of the condition. How alkaptonuria is managed Alkaptonuria is a lifelong condition \u2013 there's currently no specific treatment or cure. However, a medicine called nitisinone has shown some promise, and painkillers and lifestyle changes may help you cope with the symptoms. Nitisinone Nitisinone is not licensed for alkaptonuria \u2013 it's offered \"off label\" at the National Alkaptonuria Centre, the treatment centre for all alkaptonuria patients based at Royal Liverpool University Hospital. Nitisinone reduces the level of homogentisic acid in the body. It's currently an experimental treatment, but research into its effectiveness is ongoing and there have been some promising results so far. The AKU Society has information on DevelopAKUre, a clinical trial programme for nitisinone. Register your interest for DevelopAKUre. Diet If the condition is diagnosed in childhood, it may be possible to slow its progression by restricting protein in the diet, as this may reduce levels of tyrosine and phenylalanine in your body. A low-protein diet can also be useful in reducing the risk of potential side effects of nitisinone during adulthood. Your doctor or dietitian can advise you about this. Exercise If alkaptonuria causes pain and stiffness, you may think exercise will make your symptoms worse. But regular gentle exercise can actually help by building muscle and strengthening your joints. Exercise is also good for relieving stress, losing weight and improving your posture, all of which can ease your symptoms. The AKU Society recommends avoiding exercise that puts additional strain on the joints, such as boxing, football and rugby, and trying gentle exercise such as yoga, swimming and pilates instead. Your GP or a physiotherapist can help you come up with a suitable exercise plan to follow at home. It's important to follow this plan as there's a risk the wrong sort of exercise may damage your joints. Pain relief Speak to doctor about painkillers and other techniques to manage pain. You may want to try transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), where a machine is used to numb the nerve endings in your spinal cord and reduce pain. This treatment is usually arranged by a physiotherapist. Read about living with pain. Emotional support A diagnosis of alkaptonuria can be confusing and overwhelming at first. Like many people with a long-term health condition, those who find out they have alkaptonuria may feel anxious or depressed. But there are people you can talk to who can help. Talk to your GP if you feel you need support to cope with your illness. You could also visit the AKU Society website, a charity offering support to patients, their families and carers. Surgery Sometimes surgery may be necessary if joints are damaged and need replacing, or if heart valves or vessels have hardened. Read about some common procedures: hip replacement knee replacement  aortic valve replacement Outlook People with alkaptonuria have a normal life expectancy. However, they will usually experience severe symptoms, such as pain and loss of movement in the joints, which considerably impact on quality of life. Working and carrying out strenuous physical activity will usually become very difficult, and eventually you may need mobility aids such as a wheelchair to get around. Visit the AKU Society website for more information and support. Information about you If you or your child has alkaptonuria, your clinical team will pass information about you\/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

It's a very common condition, estimated to affect around one in every five people in the UK. Signs and symptoms Allergic rhinitis typically causes cold-like symptoms, such as sneezing, itchiness and a blocked or runny nose. These symptoms usually start soon after being exposed to an allergen. Some people only get allergic rhinitis for a few months at a time because they're sensitive to seasonal allergens, such as tree or grass pollen. Other people get allergic rhinitis all year round. Most people with allergic rhinitis have mild symptoms that can be easily and effectively treated. But for some symptoms can be severe and persistent, causing sleep problems and interfering with everyday life. The symptoms of allergic rhinitis occasionally improve with time, but this can take many years and it's unlikely that the condition will disappear completely. When to see your GP Visit your GP if the symptoms of allergic rhinitis are disrupting your sleep, preventing you carrying out everyday activities, or adversely affecting your performance at work or school. A diagnosis of allergic rhinitis will usually be based on your symptoms and any possible triggers you may have noticed. If the cause of your condition is uncertain, you may be referred for allergy testing. Read more about diagnosing allergic rhinitis. What causes allergic rhinitis? Allergic rhinitis is caused by the immune system reacting to an allergen as if it were harmful. This results in cells releasing a number of chemicals that cause the inside layer of your nose (the mucous membrane) to become swollen and excessive levels of mucus to be produced. Common allergens that cause allergic rhinitis include pollen \u2013 this type of allergic rhinitis is known as hay fever \u2013 as well as mould spores, house dust mites, and flakes of skin or droplets of urine or saliva from certain animals. Read more about the causes of allergic rhinitis. Treating and preventing allergic rhinitis It's difficult to completely avoid potential allergens, but you can take steps to reduce exposure to a particular allergen you know or suspect is triggering your allergic rhinitis. This will help improve your symptoms. If your condition is mild, you can also help reduce the symptoms by taking over-the-counter medications, such as non-sedating antihistamines, and by regularly rinsing your nasal passages with a salt water solution to keep your nose free of irritants. See your GP for advice if you've tried taking these steps and they haven't helped. They may prescribe a stronger medication, such as a nasal spray containing corticosteroids. Read more about treating allergic rhinitis and preventing allergic rhinitis. Further problems Allergic rhinitis can lead to complications in some cases. These include: nasal polyps \u2013 abnormal but non-cancerous (benign) sacs of fluid that grow inside the nasal passages and sinuses sinusitis \u2013 an infection caused by nasal inflammation and swelling that prevents mucus draining from the sinuses middle ear infections \u2013 infection of part of the ear located directly behind the eardrum These problems can often be treated with medication, although surgery is sometimes needed in severe or long-term cases. Read more about the complications of allergic rhinitis. Non-allergic rhinitis Not all cases of rhinitis are caused by an allergic reaction. Some cases are the result of: an infection, such as the common cold oversensitive blood vessels in the nose overuse of nasal decongestants This type of rhinitis is known as non-allergic rhinitis.

Allergies are very common. They're thought to affect more than one in four people in the UK at some point in their lives. They are particularly common in children. Some allergies go away as a child gets older, although many are lifelong. Adults can develop allergies to things they weren't previously allergic to. Having an allergy can be a nuisance and affect your everyday activities, but most allergic reactions are mild and can be largely kept under control. Severe reactions can occasionally occur, but these are uncommon. Common allergies Substances that cause allergic reactions are called allergens. The more common allergens include: grass and tree pollen \u2013 an allergy to these is known as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) dust mites animal dander (tiny flakes of skin or hair) food \u2013 particularly nuts, fruit, shellfish, eggs and cow's milk insect bites and stings medication \u2013 including ibuprofen, aspirin, and certain antibiotics latex \u2013 used to make some gloves and condoms mould \u2013 these can release small particles into the air that you can breathe in household chemicals \u2013 including those in detergents and hair dyes Most of these allergens are generally harmless to people who aren't allergic to them. Symptoms of an allergic reaction Allergic reactions usually happen quickly within a few minutes of exposure to an allergen. They can cause: sneezing a runny or blocked nose red, itchy, watery eyes wheezing and coughing a red, itchy rash worsening of asthma or eczema symptoms Most allergic reactions are mild, but occasionally a severe reaction called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock can occur. This is a medical emergency and needs urgent treatment. Read more about the symptoms of allergies. Getting help for allergies See your GP if you think you or your child might have had an allergic reaction to something. The symptoms of an allergic reaction can also be caused by other conditions. Your GP can help determine whether it's likely you have an allergy. If your GP thinks you might have a mild allergy, they can offer advice and treatment to help manage the condition. If your allergy is particularly severe or it's not clear what you're allergic to, your GP may refer you to an allergy specialist for testing and advice about treatment. Read more about allergy testing. How to manage an allergy In many cases, the most effective way of managing an allergy is to avoid the allergen that causes the reaction whenever possible. For example, if you have a food allergy, you should check a food's ingredients list for allergens before eating it. The Food Standards Agency has more information about food allergen labelling. There are also several medications available to help control symptoms of allergic reactions, including: antihistamines \u2013 these can be taken when you notice the symptoms of a reaction, or before being exposed to an allergen to stop a reaction occurring decongestants \u2013 tablets, capsules, nasal sprays or liquids that can be used as a short-term treatment for a blocked nose lotions and creams, such as moisturising creams (emollients) \u2013 these can reduce skin redness and itchiness steroid medication \u2013 sprays, drops, creams, inhalers and tablets that can help reduce redness and swelling caused by an allergic reaction For some people with very severe allergies, a treatment called immunotherapy may be recommended. This involves being exposed to the allergen in a controlled way over a number of years, so your body gets used to it and doesn't react to it so severely. Read more about treating an allergy and avoiding allergic reactions. What causes allergies? Allergies occur when the body's immune system reacts to a particular substance as though it's harmful. It's not clear why this happens, but most people affected have a family history of allergies or have closely related conditions such as asthma or eczema. The number of people with allergies is increasing every year. The reasons for this are not understood, but one of the main theories is it's the result of living in a cleaner, germ-free environment, which reduces the number of germs our immune system has to deal with. It's thought this may cause it to overreact when it comes into contact with harmless substances. Is it an allergy, sensitivity or intolerance? allergy \u2013 a reaction produced by the body's immune system when exposed to a normally harmless substance sensitivity \u2013 the exaggeration of the normal effects of a substance; for example, the caffeine in a cup of coffee may cause extreme symptoms, such as palpitations and trembling intolerance \u2013 where a substance causes unpleasant symptoms, such as diarrhoea, but doesn't involve the immune system; people with an intolerance to certain foods can typically eat a small amount without having any problems Page last reviewed: 12\/02\/2016 Next review due: 12\/02\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It is also known as anaphylactic shock. Signs of anaphylaxis include: itchy skin or a raised, red skin rash swollen eyes, lips, hands and feet feeling lightheaded or faint swelling of the mouth, throat or tongue, which can cause breathing and swallowing difficulties wheezing abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting collapse and unconsciousness What to do Anaphylaxis should always be treated as a medical emergency. If available, an injection of a medicine called adrenaline should be given as soon as possible. Some people with a previous history of anaphylaxis will have an auto-injector of adrenaline. This should be injected into their outer thigh muscle and held in place for 5 to 10 seconds. Instructions for how to use these auto-injectors can be found on the side of each device. You should call 999 for an ambulance whether adrenaline has been given or not. If after 5 to 10 minutes the person still feels unwell, a second injection should be given. This should be given in the opposite thigh. A second dose may also be needed if the person improves and then becomes unwell again. The person should lie flat, with their legs raised on a chair or a low table. If they are having difficulty breathing, they should sit up to make breathing easier. If the person is unconscious, you should move them to the recovery position \u2013 on their side, supported by one leg and one arm, with the head tilted back and the chin lifted. If the person's breathing or heart stops, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be performed. Further treatment will be carried out in hospital. Read more about treating anaphylaxis. Causes and triggers Anaphylaxis is the result of your body's immune system overreacting to a harmless substance, such as food. Substances that trigger allergic reactions are known as allergens. Anaphylaxis usually develops within minutes of contact with an allergen, but sometimes the reaction can happen up to four hours later. The most widely reported triggers of anaphylaxis are: insect stings \u2013 particularly wasp and bee stings peanuts and tree nuts other types of foods \u2013 such as milk and seafood certain medicines \u2013 such as antibiotics Read more about the causes of anaphylaxis. Preventing further episodes If you know what has triggered anaphylaxis, it's important to take steps to avoid exposure to similar triggers. You should be referred to a specialist allergy clinic to either find out your allergy triggers or, if you already know what causes it, for further assessment and advice about how to avoid allergens in the future. You may be given two adrenaline auto-injectors to use during any future episodes of anaphylaxis. Read more about preventing anaphylaxis.  Who is affected? Anaphylaxis is not common, but people of all ages can be affected. People with other allergic conditions, such as asthma or the allergic skin condition atopic eczema, are most at risk of developing anaphylaxis. Although the condition is life threatening, deaths are rare. There are around 20 deaths in the UK each year. With prompt and proper treatment, most people make a full recovery.  Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 04\/12\/2014 Next review due: 04\/12\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Although allergic reactions are often mild, they can be very serious. Symptoms of a food allergy can affect different areas of the body at the same time. Some common symptoms include: an itchy sensation inside the mouth, throat or ears a raised itchy red rash (urticaria, or \"hives\") swelling of the face, around the eyes, lips, tongue and roof of the mouth (angioedema) vomiting Read more about the symptoms of food allergies. Anaphylaxis In the most serious cases, a person has a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which can be life threatening. If you think someone has the symptoms of anaphylaxis \u2013 such as breathing difficulties, lightheadedness, and feeling like they're going to faint or lose consciousness \u2013 call 999. Ask for an ambulance and tell the operator you think the person has anaphylaxis or \"anaphylactic shock\". What causes food allergies? Food allergies happen when the immune system \u2013 the body's defence against infection \u2013 mistakenly treats proteins found in food as a threat. As a result, a number of chemicals are released. It's these chemicals that cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction. Almost any food can cause an allergic reaction, but there are certain foods that are responsible for most food allergies. In children, the foods that most commonly cause an allergic reaction are: milk eggs peanuts tree nuts fish shellfish Most children that have a food allergy will have experienced eczema during infancy. The worse the child's eczema and the earlier it started, the more likely they are to have a food allergy. In adults, the foods that most commonly cause an allergic reaction are: peanuts tree nuts \u2013 such as walnuts, brazil nuts, almonds and hazelnuts fruits \u2013 such as apples and peaches fish shellfish \u2013 such as crab, lobster and prawns It's still unknown why people develop allergies to food, although they often have other allergic conditions, such as asthma, hay fever and eczema. Read more information about the causes and risk factors for food allergies. Types of food allergies Food allergies are divided into three types, depending on symptoms and when they occur. IgE-mediated food allergy \u2013 the most common type, triggered by the immune system producing an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE). Symptoms occur a few seconds or minutes after eating. There's a greater risk of anaphylaxis with this type of allergy. non-IgE-mediated food allergy \u2013 these allergic reactions aren't caused by immunoglobulin E, but by other cells in the immune system. This type of allergy is often difficult to diagnose as symptoms take much longer to develop (up to several hours). mixed IgE and non-IgE-mediated food allergies \u2013 some people may experience symptoms from both types. Read more information about the symptoms of a food allergy. Oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food syndrome) Some people experience itchiness in their mouth and throat, sometimes with mild swelling, immediately after eating fresh fruit or vegetables. This is known as oral allergy syndrome. Oral allergy syndrome is caused by allergy antibodies mistaking certain proteins in fresh fruits, nuts or vegetables for pollen. Oral allergy syndrome generally doesn't cause severe symptoms, and it's possible to deactivate the allergens by thoroughly cooking any fruit and vegetables. Some people with pollen-food syndrome may have more severe symptoms. The Allergy UK website has more information on oral allergy syndrome. Treatment The best way of preventing an allergic reaction is to identify the food that causes the allergy and avoid it. Research is currently looking at ways to desensitise some food allergens, such as peanuts and milk, but this is not an established treatment. Read more about identifying foods that cause allergies (allergens). Avoid making any radical changes, such as cutting out dairy products, to your or your child's diet without first talking to your GP. For some foods, such as milk, you may need to speak to a dietitian before making any changes. A type of medication called an antihistamine can help relieve the symptoms of a mild or moderate allergic reaction. A higher dose of antihistamine is often needed to control acute allergic symptoms. Adrenaline is an effective treatment for more severe allergic symptoms, such as anaphylaxis. People with a food allergy are often given a device known as an auto-injector pen, which contains doses of adrenaline that can be used in emergencies. Read more about the treatment of food allergies.  When to seek medical advice If you think you or your child may have a food allergy, it's very important to ask for a professional diagnosis from your GP. They can then refer you to an allergy clinic if appropriate. Many parents mistakenly assume their child has a food allergy when their symptoms are actually caused by a completely different condition. Commercial allergy testing kits are available, but using them isn't recommended. Many kits are based on unsound scientific principles. Even if they're reliable, you should have the results looked at by a health professional. Read more about diagnosing food allergies. Who's affected? Most food allergies affect younger children under the age of three. It's estimated around 1 in every 14 children of this age has at least one food allergy. Most children who have food allergies to milk, eggs, soya and wheat in early life will grow out of it by the time they start school. Peanut and tree nut allergies are usually more persistent. An estimated four out of five children with peanut allergies remain allergic to peanuts for the rest of their lives. Food allergies that develop during adulthood, or persist into adulthood, are likely to be lifelong allergies. For reasons that are unclear, rates of food allergies have risen sharply in the last 20 years. However, deaths from anaphylaxis-related food reactions are now rare. There are around 10 deaths related to food allergies in England and Wales each year. Food allergy and intolerance myth buster There are many myths about food allergies and intolerances \u2013 can you tell fact from fiction? And what is the difference between the two?  What is food intolerance? A food intolerance isn't the same as a food allergy. People with food intolerance may have symptoms such as diarrhoea, bloating and stomach cramps. This may be caused by difficulties digesting certain substances, such as lactose. However, no allergic reaction takes place. Important differences between a food allergy and a food intolerance include: the symptoms of a food intolerance usually occur several hours after eating the food you need to eat a larger amount of food to trigger an intolerance than an allergy a food intolerance is never life threatening, unlike an allergy Read more about the differences between food allergy and food intolerance.

It usually starts around the late twenties or early thirties and most men have some degree of hair loss by their late thirties. It generally follows a pattern of a receding hairline, followed by thinning of the hair on the crown and temples, leaving a horseshoe shape around the back and sides of the head. Sometimes it can progress to complete baldness, although this is uncommon. Male-pattern baldness is hereditary, which means it runs in families. It's thought to be caused by oversensitive hair follicles, linked to having too much of a certain male hormone. As well as affecting men, it can sometimes affect women (female-pattern baldness). During female-pattern baldness, hair usually only thins on top of the head. It's not clear if female-pattern baldness is hereditary and the causes are less well understood. However, it tends to be more noticeable in women who have been through the menopause (when a woman's periods stop at around age 52), perhaps because they have fewer female hormones. Alopecia areata Alopecia areata causes patches of baldness about the size of a large coin. They usually appear on the scalp but can occur anywhere on the body. It can occur at any age, but mostly affects teenagers and young adults. In most cases of alopecia areata, hair will grow back in a few months. At first, hair may grow back fine and white, but over time it should thicken and regain its normal colour. Some people go on to develop a more severe form of hair loss, such as: alopecia totalis (no scalp hair) alopecia universalis (no hair on the scalp and body) Alopecia areata is caused by a problem with the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness). It's more common among people with other autoimmune conditions, such as an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), diabetes or Down's syndrome. It's also believed some people's genes make them more susceptible to alopecia areata, as one in five people with the condition have a family history of the condition. Alopecia areata can occur at any age, although it's more common in people aged 15-29. It affects one or two people in every 1,000 in the UK. Scarring alopecia  Scarring alopecia, also known as cicatricial alopecia, is usually caused by complications of another condition. In this type of alopecia, the hair follicle (the small hole in your skin that an individual hair grows out of) is completely destroyed. This means your hair won't grow back. Depending on the condition, the skin where the hair has fallen out is likely to be affected in some way. Conditions which can cause scarring alopecia include: scleroderma \u2013 a condition affecting the body's connective (supporting) tissues, resulting in hard, puffy and itchy skin lichen planus \u2013 an itchy rash affecting many areas of the body discoid lupus \u2013 a mild form of lupus affecting the skin, causing scaly marks and hair loss folliculitis decalvans \u2013 a rare form of alopecia that most commonly affects men, causing baldness and scarring of the affected areas frontal fibrosing alopecia \u2013 a type of alopecia that affects post-menopausal women where the hair follicles are damaged, and the hair falls out and is unable to grow back Scarring alopecia occurs in both males and females, but is less common in children than adults. It accounts for about 7% of hair loss cases. Anagen effluvium Anagen effluvium is widespread hair loss that can affect your scalp, face and body. One of the most common causes of this type of hair loss is the cancer treatment chemotherapy. In some cases, other cancer treatments \u2013 including immunotherapy and radiotherapy \u2013 may also cause hair loss. The hair loss is usually noticeable within a few weeks of starting treatment. However, not all chemotherapy drugs cause hair loss and sometimes the hair loss is so small it's hardly noticeable. It may be possible to reduce hair loss from chemotherapy by wearing a special cap that keeps the scalp cool. However, scalp cooling is not always effective and not widely available. In most cases, hair loss in anagen effluvium is temporary. Your hair should start to grow back a few months after chemotherapy has stopped. Telogen effluvium Telogen effluvium is a common type of alopecia where there is widespread thinning of the hair, rather than specific bald patches. Your hair may feel thinner, but you're unlikely to lose it all and your other body hair isn't usually affected. Telogen effluvium can be caused by your body reacting to: hormonal changes, such as those that take place when a woman is pregnant intense emotional stress intense physical stress, such as childbirth a short-term illness, such as a severe infection or an operation a long-term illness, such as cancer or liver disease changes in your diet, such as crash dieting some medications, such as anticoagulants (medicines that reduce the ability of your blood to clot) or beta-blockers (used to treat a number of conditions, such as high blood pressure) In most cases of telogen effluvium, your hair will stop falling out and start to grow back within six months. How is hair loss treated? More common types of hair loss, such as male-pattern baldness, don't need treatment because they're a natural part of ageing and don't pose a risk to your health. However, any type of hair loss can be distressing, so you should see your GP if you're worried about it. Your GP should be able to diagnose your type of hair loss by examining your hair. They can also discuss possible treatments with you so it's advisable to visit your GP before trying a private consultant dermatologist (skin care specialist). If you want treatment for male-pattern baldness for cosmetic reasons, two medications called finasteride and minoxidil can be used. Minoxidil can also be used to treat female-pattern baldness. However, these treatments don't work for everyone and only work for as long as they're continued. They are not available on the NHS and can be expensive. Alopecia areata is usually treated with steroid injections, although it's sometimes possible to use a steroid cream, gel or ointment. A treatment called immunotherapy may also be used. This involves stimulating hair growth by causing an intentional allergic reaction in the affected areas of skin. If you have significant hair loss of any type, you may decide to wear a wig. Wigs are available on the NHS, but you may have to pay unless you qualify for help with charges. There are also some surgical options for hair loss, including a hair transplant and artificial hair implants. Read more about treating hair loss. Emotional issues Hair loss can be difficult to come to terms with. The hair on your head can be a defining part of your identity. If you start to lose your hair, it can feel as if you're losing part of your identity. This can affect your self-confidence and sometimes lead to depression. Speak to your GP if you're finding it difficult to deal with your hair loss. They may suggest counselling. You may also benefit from joining a support group or speaking to other people in the same situation \u2013 for example, through online forums. A number of charities, such as Alopecia UK, have support groups and online forums where you can talk to others who are experiencing hair loss.

The decrease in atmospheric pressure makes breathing difficult because you aren't able to take in as much oxygen. Most cases are mild, with symptoms that can include: headache   nausea dizziness exhaustion In rare cases, altitude sickness can cause fluid to build up either on the lungs or the brain. These are very serious conditions and require immediate medical attention. Symptoms of severe altitude sickness can include: a bubbling sound in the chest worsening breathlessness  coughing up pink, frothy liquid clumsiness and difficulty walking confusion leading to loss of consciousness Read more about the symptoms of altitude sickness and the complications of altitude sickness. What to do if you have symptoms If you have mild symptoms of altitude sickness, you shouldn't go any higher for at least 24 to 48 hours. You can continue to climb if your symptoms improve after this. If your symptoms get worse or don't improve after 24 to 48 hours, you should descend by at least 500m. Severe altitude sickness is a medical emergency. Someone with severe symptoms should immediately descend to a low altitude and seek medical help. Read more about treating altitude sickness. Preventing altitude sickness Proper acclimatisation to altitudes of about 2,500m (just over 8,200 feet) or more is the best way to prevent altitude sickness. It usually takes a few days for the body to get used to a change in altitude. Ascending slowly will give your body time to adapt to the change in altitude. For example, once you're above 3,000m (10,000 feet) try not to increase the altitude at which you sleep by more than 300-500m a night. Keeping hydrated is also important, but make sure you avoid alcohol. Read more about preventing altitude sickness. Who's affected by altitude sickness? Altitude sickness is fairly common among those who spend time at high altitudes, such as mountaineers and skiers. In its mildest form, altitude sickness can occur at heights over about 2,500m (8,000 feet) above sea level, which is a common height for many ski resorts. However, the more severe symptoms of altitude sickness tend to occur at altitudes of 3,600m (about 12,000 feet) and above. It's not possible to get altitude sickness in the UK because the highest mountain, Ben Nevis in Scotland, is only 1,344m (4,406 feet) high. There are no specific factors, such as age, sex or physical fitness, that increase a person's likelihood of getting altitude sickness. Certain people are affected, while others are less susceptible to it. Just because you haven't had it before doesn't mean you won't develop it on another trip.

Dementia is a progressive neurological disease which affects multiple brain functions, including memory. The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is unknown, although a number of things are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: increasing age a family history of the condition previous severe head injuries lifestyle factors and conditions associated with cardiovascular disease It's becoming increasingly understood that it's very common to have both changes of Alzheimer's and vascular dementia together (mixed dementia). Read more about the causes of Alzheimer's disease. Signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition, which means the symptoms develop gradually and become more severe over the course of several years. It affects multiple brain functions. The first sign of Alzheimer's disease is usually minor memory problems. For example, this could be forgetting about recent conversations or events, and forgetting the names of places and objects. As the condition develops, memory problems become more severe and further symptoms can develop, such as: confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places difficulty planning or making decisions problems with speech and language problems moving around without assistance or performing self-care tasks personality changes, such as becoming aggressive, demanding and suspicious of others hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there) and delusions (believing things that are untrue) low mood or anxiety Read more about the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Who is affected? Alzheimer's disease is most common in people over the age of 65, and affects slightly more women than men. The risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia increases with age, affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80. However, around 1 in every 20 cases of Alzheimer's disease affects people aged 40 to 65. Receiving a diagnosis As the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease progress slowly, it can be difficult to recognise that there's a problem. Many people feel that memory problems are simply a part of getting older. However, a timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can give you the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment or support that may help. If you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it's a good idea to see your GP. If you're worried about someone else, you should encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them. There's no single test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Your GP will ask questions about any problems you are experiencing and may do some tests to rule out other conditions. If Alzheimer's disease is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist memory service to:   discuss the process of making the diagnosis organise testing  create a treatment plan   Read more about diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. How Alzheimer's disease is treated There's no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but medication is available that can help relieve some of the symptoms and slow down the progression of the condition in some people. Various other types of support are also available to help people with Alzheimer's live as independently as possible, such as making changes to your home environment so it's easier to move around and remember daily tasks. Psychological treatments such as cognitive stimulation therapy may also be offered to help support your memory, problem solving skills and language ability. Read more about treating Alzheimer's disease. Outlook On average, people with Alzheimer's disease live for around 8 to 10 years after they start to develop symptoms. However, this can vary considerably from person to person. Some people with the condition will live longer than this, but others will not. Alzheimer's disease is a life-limiting illness, although many people diagnosed with the condition will die from another cause. As Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a progressive neurological condition, it can cause problems with swallowing. This can lead to aspiration (food being inhaled into the lungs) which can cause frequent chest infections. It's also common for people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease to eventually have difficulty eating and to have a reduced appetite.  There's increasing awareness that people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease need palliative care. This includes support for families, as well as the person with Alzheimer's. Can Alzheimer's disease be prevented? As the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease isn't clear, there's no known way to prevent the condition. However, there are things you can do that may reduce your risk or delay the onset of dementia, such as: stopping smoking and cutting down on alcohol eating a healthy, balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight staying physically fit and mentally active These measures have other health benefits, such as lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease and improving your overall mental health.

Carers' support groups Media last reviewed: 24\/05\/2016 Next review due: 24\/05\/2019 If you have dementia, or you are looking after someone who has dementia, you are likely to face many practical issues in your daily life. People with dementia can feel vulnerable as their condition progresses and they increasingly rely on other people to do things for them. It is important that people who have dementia feel reassured and supported, while retaining some level of independence.  For more information, read staying independent with dementia. Although some symptoms are common to many people with dementia, each person's experience of the disease and how they cope with it will be different. Helping someone with dementia with everyday tasks When a person with dementia finds that their mental abilities are declining, they're likely to feel anxious, stressed and scared. They may be aware of their increasing clumsiness and inability to remember things, and this can be very frustrating and upsetting for them. If you are looking after someone with dementia, you can help them feel more secure by creating a regular daily routine in a relaxed environment, where they're encouraged and not criticised. Involving the person you look after in everyday tasks may make them feel useful and improve their sense of self-worth. They could help with the shopping, laying the table or sweeping leaves in the garden, for example. As the illness progresses, these tasks may become harder for them to manage independently, and you may need to give them more support. How you can help The main way you can help someone with dementia is by offering support sensitively and try not to be critical of what they do. It can be very important for the person with dementia to feel that they're still useful. In the early stages, memory aids can be used around the home to help the person remember where things are. For example, you could put pictures on cupboard doors of what's inside, such as cups and saucers. This may help to trigger their memory and enable them to retain their independence a little longer. Keeping up hobbies and interests when someone has dementia Many people with dementia will still enjoy their hobbies or interests. For example, if they like cooking, they may be able to help make a meal. Going for a walk or gardening is a simple way to get some exercise and a sense of achievement. Or they may prefer listening to music or playing a board game. Caring for a pet cat or dog can bring a lot of pleasure to some people. If the person you care for was very sociable and outgoing, or if they have a large family, they may really enjoy visits from one or two family members or friends. However, they may struggle to keep up with conversations if they have a lot of visitors at the same time. You can find tips and ideas for people with dementia in this activities guide from Care UK (PDF, 1Mb). Maintaining good health and nutrition in someone with dementia It's important that the person you care for has a healthy, balanced diet and gets some exercise. The longer they stay fit and healthy, the better their quality of life will be. If you want some easy exercises, try these sitting exercises.  If the person you care for doesn't eat enough or eats unhealthy food, they can become susceptible to other illnesses. People with dementia can become more confused if they get ill. Common food-related problems for people with dementia include: not recognising foods forgetting what food they like refusing or spitting out food resisting being fed asking for strange food combinations This behaviour is usually due to confusion, or irritation in the mouth caused by dental problems, rather than wanting to be awkward. If you're concerned about the person's eating behaviour, speak to your GP. How you can help Involve the person you care for. For example, if they cannot feed themselves, you could put the cutlery in their hand and help guide it to their mouth. You could also involve them in preparing food, if they are able to. Try to stay calm. If you feel stressed at mealtimes, the person you care for will probably be stressed too. Make sure you have plenty of time for meals, so you can deal with any problems that arise. Try to accommodate behaviour changes. It's likely that the person you care for will change their eating patterns and habits over time. Being aware of this and trying to be flexible will make mealtimes less stressful for both of you. If you think the person you care for may have health or dental problems, get help from your GP or dentist. You could also contact a local carers' group to speak to other people who may have experienced similar difficulties. If the person with dementia smokes, replace matches with disposable lighters to lower the risk of them accidentally causing a fire. If the person you care for drinks alcohol, check if this is recommended alongside any medication they make take. If in doubt, ask your GP. Dealing with incontinence in someone with dementia Incontinence can be difficult to deal with and can be very upsetting for the person you care for. It's common for people with dementia to experience incontinence. This can be due to urinary tract infections, constipation causing added pressure on the bladder, or medication. A person with dementia may also simply forget to go to the toilet, or may forget where the toilet is. They may also have lost the ability to tell when they need the toilet. How you can help It's important to be understanding, retain a sense of humour and remember that it's not their fault. You may also want to try the following: Put a sign on the toilet door, such as a photo of the toilet. Keep the toilet door open and make sure that the person you care for can access it easily. Make sure they can remove their clothes \u2013 some people with dementia can struggle with buttons and zips. Look out for signs that they may need to go to the toilet, such as fidgeting and standing up and down. Get adaptations to the toilet if necessary \u2013 you may be able to get these through a care and support needs assessment. If you're still having problems with incontinence, ask your GP to refer you to a continence advisor, who can advise on things like waterproof bedding or incontinence pads. Helping someone with dementia with their personal hygiene People with dementia can become anxious about certain aspects of personal hygiene and may need help with washing. For example, they may be scared of falling when getting out of the bath, or they may become disorientated in the shower. The person you care for may not want to be left alone or they may resist washing, because they find the lack of privacy undignified and embarrassing. Try to do what's best for them. Read more about personal hygiene for people who are cared for. Helping someone with dementia sleep well People with dementia often experience disturbed sleep. They may wake up during the night or be restless. These problems may get worse as the illness progresses. People with dementia may also have painful illnesses such as arthritis that cause, or contribute to, sleep problems. Some medication can cause sleepiness during the day and interfere with sleep at night. Sleeping pills can be used with care in people with dementia. However, \"sleep hygiene\" measures are best for people with dementia \u2013 for example, no naps during the day, regular bedtimes, and avoiding alcohol or caffeine at night. Read more about sleeping well. Taking care of your own wellbeing If you or a family member has dementia, you may find it difficult to stay positive. Remember that you are not alone, and that help and support is available. Talk to someone about your worries. This could be a family member or friend, a member of your local dementia support group, or your GP can refer you to a counsellor in your area. It is important for a carer's physical health and psychological wellbeing that they are able to take a break (respite) from care. Carers may also need respite care if they have to go into hospital or meet other important commitments. Friends, relatives and neighbours can provide respite care at home. You can also arrange home respite care through home care agencies or, in some areas, your local authority. Care away from home can confuse some people with dementia, both while they are away and when they come back. If you decide on respite care away from the person's home, it is a good idea to visit beforehand to check that it meets the needs of the person with dementia. Caring for someone with dementia can be frustrating and stressful at times, but there are many organisations that can help. For more details, call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053. Lines are open 9am-8pm Monday to Friday and 11am-4pm on weekends. Reading Well Books on Prescription for dementia offers support for people diagnosed with dementia and their relatives and carers.

If you have a DSD, you will have a mix of male and female sexual characteristics. You may have the sex chromosomes (bundles of genes) normally associated with being female (XX chromosomes) or male (XY chromosomes), but your reproductive organs and genitals may be of the opposite sex, not clearly male nor female (ambiguous or atypical), or a mixture of both. This occurs because of a difference with your genetic make-up and\/or how you respond to the sex hormones in your body. These conditions can be inherited, but often they occur randomly for no apparent reason. Read more about genes and genetics. Types of DSDs There are different types of DSD, and each has a different cause. Below are some examples. Female with ambiguous or male-looking genitals Some people have XX (female) chromosomes with normal ovaries and womb, but their genitals appear ambiguous or male. For example, they may have an enlarged clitoris resembling a penis and their lower vagina may be closed. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX DSD. The most common cause is a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). If your child has CAH, they lack a particular enzyme (protein) that their body needs to make hormones called cortisol and aldosterone. Without these, the body produces more androgens (male sex hormones). If the affected child is female, then the raised androgen levels before birth cause the genitals to become more male in appearance. This condition can also lead to serious health issues, such as life-threatening kidney problems that need to be treated as soon as possible. For support and more information on CAH, you can visit the CAH support group. Female with normal external genitals but some internal male structures Some women have XY (male) chromosomes but their external genitals may appear entirely female or atypical. The womb may be present or absent and the testicles may be absent or not properly formed. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XY DSD. There are several different causes of this condition. One possible cause is androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), where the body ignores androgens or is insensitive to them, so development is female. The testes usually remain inside their body and the womb does not develop. AIS is thought to occur in around one in every 20,000 births, although the exact figures are unknown. For support and more information on AIS, you can visit the AIS Support Group.  A mix of male and female characteristics People with this very rare type of DSD have both ovarian and testicular tissue (for example, one ovary and one testis), and their genitals may appear female, male or a mix of both. Most people with this type of DSD have XX (female) chromosomes and, although the cause is not usually clear, some cases have been linked to genetic material normally found on the Y chromosome becoming misplaced on the X chromosome. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX ovotesticular DSD. Normally formed genitals but abnormal sexual development Some people have neither XY nor XX chromosomes \u2013 for example, they may only have one X chromosome (XO), or they may have an extra chromosome (XXY). Physically, their sex organs are normally formed as either male (testes and a penis) or female (ovaries, womb and a vagina), but they may not go through normal sexual development at puberty. For example, a child with female sex organs may not start having periods and may have small breasts. Doctors refer to this condition as sex chromosome DSD. About one in 600 newborn boys will have the genetic condition Klinefelter syndrome, which means they are born with an extra X chromosome (XXY). Adult males with Klinefelter syndrome may not be able to produce enough testosterone, the sex hormone responsible for the development of male characteristics and important for maintaining bone strength, libido and fertility in men. Girls or women with Turner syndrome are missing an X chromosome, which means they're usually infertile and their height is shorter than average. Female with an absent womb Some females are born with an underdeveloped or absent womb, cervix and upper vagina, but the ovaries and external genitalia (vulva) are still present and they still develop breasts and pubic hair as they get older. This is known as Rokitansky syndrome (also called Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser or MRKH syndrome). It\u2019s thought to affect around one in every 4,000 to 5,000 females. The cause of Rokitansky syndrome is not clear, but it\u2019s not related to the chromosomes because girls and women with it have the normal XX chromosomes. Often the first sign of Rokitansky syndrome is that a girl does not start having periods. Sex may also be difficult because the vagina is shorter than normal. As they have no womb, women with Rokitansky syndrome cannot become pregnant, but it\u2019s sometimes possible to take eggs from their ovaries, fertilise them, and implant them in another women (surrogate). For support and more information on Rokitansky syndrome, you can visit the websites of Living MRKH, the MRKH Organization and the Boston Center for Young Women\u2019s Health. What happens after birth Some cases of DSD are suspected soon after birth because of obvious signs such as undescended testicles or an atypical or ambiguous genital appearance. In such cases, a number of tests may be carried out to help confirm the diagnosis and identify any medical problems that may require immediate treatment. These tests may include a further physical examination of your baby carried out by a specialist, an ultrasound scan to examine their internal organs, and blood tests. Your care team may advise you to delay registering your child's birth for a few days while these tests are carried out. Afterwards, the results will be explained to you and you will have a discussion with specialists about whether to bring your baby up as a boy or a girl. Emergency treatment is rarely needed for a DSD, but the team of specialists can also talk to you about your options regarding immediate or delayed treatment with hormone therapy or surgery. Advice for parents of older children Sometimes a DSD may be diagnosed if an older child does not develop normally in puberty. For example, your child may not start the normal puberty changes or may start puberty but not start periods. You should speak to your GP if you have any concerns about your child\u2019s development at puberty. They should refer your child to a specialist, usually a consultant in paediatric endocrinology or an adolescent gynaecologist. A team of different healthcare professionals will work together to understand your child's condition and offer you and your child support and advice. As your child grows up, they may need hormone therapy and psychological support, and they may eventually decide they want surgery to change their physical appearance. With the right care and support, many people with DSDs come to terms with their condition and live happily. If you think you have a DSD If you think or know that you have a DSD, help and support is available. You should speak to your GP initially, as they will be able to refer you to a team of specialist healthcare professionals who can offer support and advice. Most people with a DSD stay with the gender they were assigned as a baby, but if you feel the gender you were assigned does not represent who you are, you may wish to change your gender. This will be something you can discuss with your team of specialists. If you have a DSD, you may be infertile and you may need hormone therapy and psychological support, but the right care and support can help you come to terms with your condition and lead a normal life. Support groups If you have a DSD, or you are the parent of a child who does, you may find it useful to contact or join a support group. These groups can often offer more information and advice about living with a DSD, and they may be able to put you in contact with others who have been in a similar situation to you. National DSD support groups include: DSD Families Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Support Group MRKH UK Your care team may also be able to recommend support groups in your local area. Terminology Disorders of sex development (DSDs) are also sometimes called intersex conditions. Some doctors also used to refer to a person with a DSD as a hermaphrodite. However, this term is longer used as it is misleading and can be insensitive. DSDs should not be confused with gender dysphoria, which is also known as transsexuality or being transgender. Gender dysphoria is where the reproductive organs and genitals have developed normally, but the person feels that their gender identity (their sense of what sex they are) does not match their biological sex.

An estimated 1 in 30 to 1 in 50 children will develop a lazy eye. The condition is usually diagnosed around the age of four. Lazy eye can sometimes affect both eyes, although this is rare. How do I know if my child has a lazy eye? A lazy eye doesn't usually cause symptoms. Younger children are often unaware that there's anything wrong with their vision and, if they are, they're usually unable to explain what's wrong. Older children may complain that they can't see as well through one eye and have problems with reading, writing and drawing. In some cases, you may notice that one eye looks different from the other. However, this is usually a sign of another condition that could lead to a lazy eye, such as: a squint \u2013 where the weaker eye looks inwards, outwards, upwards or downwards, while the other eye looks forwards refractive errors \u2013 where a person is either short-sighted (myopia) or long-sighted (hyperopia) childhood cataracts \u2013 cloudy patches that develop in the lens, which is located behind the clear layer of tissue at the front of the eye (cornea)  One way to check your child's eyes is to cover each eye with your hand, one at a time. They might object to covering the good eye, but they might not mind if you cover the lazy eye. If they try to push your hand away from one eye but not the other, it may be a sign they can see better out of one eye. When to seek medical advice Lazy eye is often diagnosed during routine eye tests before parents realise there's a problem.  Children should have their eyes tested once they're old enough to attend a sight test, which is usually after they are 3.5 years old. It's difficult to treat lazy eye after the age of 4.5, so it's a good idea for children to have an eye test between the ages of 3.5 and 4.5. However, visit your GP if you have any concerns about your child's eyesight. If necessary, they can refer your child to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for further testing. Read more about diagnosing a lazy eye. What causes a lazy eye? The eyes work like a camera. Light passes through the lens of each eye and reaches a light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye called the retina. The retina translates the image into nerve signals that are sent to the brain. The brain combines the signals from each eye into a three-dimensional image. A lazy eye occurs when the brain connections responsible for vision aren't made properly. This can be the result of: a reduction in the amount of light entering the eye a lack of focus in the eye confusion between the eyes \u2013 where the two images aren't the same (such as a squint) Left untreated, this can lead to the eye's central vision never reaching normal levels. Read more about the causes of a lazy eye. Treating a lazy eye In most cases it is possible to treat a lazy eye, usually in two stages. The underlying problem is first corrected using glasses to correct the focus of the eye, which often helps to correct a squint as well. The child is then encouraged to use the affected eye again. This can be done using an eye patch to cover the stronger eye, or eye drops to temporarily impair the vision in the stronger eye. Treatment is often effective, but it's a gradual process that takes many months to work. Read more about treating a lazy eye.

Central vision is what you see when you focus straight ahead. In AMD, this vision becomes increasingly blurred, which means: reading becomes difficult  colours appear less vibrant people's faces are difficult to recognise This sight loss usually happens gradually over time, although it can sometimes be rapid. AMD doesn't affect your peripheral vision (side vision), which means it will not cause complete blindness.   Read more about the symptoms of age-related macular degeneration and the complications of age-related macular degeneration. When to seek medical advice Visit your GP or optometrist if your vision is getting gradually worse. If your vision suddenly gets worse, images are distorted or you notice blind spots in your field of vision, seek medical advice immediately and book an emergency appointment with an optometrist. If AMD is suspected, you'll be referred to an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for tests and any necessary treatment. Read more about how age-related macular degeneration is diagnosed. Why it happens Macular degeneration develops when the part of the eye responsible for central vision (the macula) is unable to function as effectively as it used to. There are two main types \u2013 dry AMD and wet AMD. Dry AMD Dry AMD develops when the cells of the macula become damaged by a build-up of deposits called drusen. It's the most common and least serious type of AMD, accounting for around 9 out of 10 cases. Vision loss is gradual, occurring over many years. However, an estimated 1 in 10 people with dry AMD go on to develop wet AMD. Wet AMD Wet AMD \u2013 sometimes called neovascular AMD \u2013 develops when abnormal blood vessels form underneath the macula and damage its cells. Wet AMD is more serious than dry AMD. Without treatment, vision can deteriorate within days. Read more about the causes of age-related macular degeneration. Who's affected? AMD currently affects more than 600,000 people in the UK and is the leading cause of vision loss. By 2020, it's predicted almost 700,000 people will have late-stage AMD in the UK.  For reasons that are unclear, AMD tends to be more common in women than men. It's also more common in white and Chinese people. The condition is most common in people over the age of 50. It's estimated 1 in every 10 people over 65 have some degree of AMD. Treating macular degeneration There's currently no cure for either type of AMD. With dry AMD, treatment aims to help a person make the most of their remaining vision \u2013 for example, magnifying lenses can be used to make reading easier. There's some evidence to suggest a diet rich in leafy green vegetables may slow the progression of dry AMD. Wet AMD can be treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medication. This aims to stop your vision getting worse by preventing further blood vessels developing. In some cases, laser surgery can also be used to destroy abnormal blood vessels. The early diagnosis and treatment of wet AMD is essential for reducing the risk of severe vision loss. Read more about treating age-related macular degeneration. Reducing your risk It's not always possible to prevent macular degeneration because it's not clear exactly what triggers the processes that cause the condition. Your risk of developing AMD is closely linked to your age and whether you have a family history of the condition. However, you may be able to reduce your risk of developing AMD, or help prevent it getting worse, by: stopping smoking if you smoke eating a healthy, balanced diet that includes plenty of fruit and vegetables moderating your consumption of alcohol \u2013 read more about alcohol units and recommendations trying to achieve or maintain a healthy weight wearing UV-absorbing glasses when outside for long periods Juvenile macular degeneration In rare cases, macular degeneration can affect younger people. This is sometimes known as juvenile macular degeneration. It can be present at birth or develop later, but it's almost always caused by an inherited genetic disorder, such as: Stargardt's disease \u2013 the most common cause of juvenile macular degeneration, this can start in childhood or early adulthood Best's disease \u2013 also known as Best's vitelliform macular dystrophy Sorsby's dystrophy \u2013 this often begins between the ages of 30 and 40  Page last reviewed: 24\/08\/2015 Next review due: 24\/08\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Most women have a period every 28 days or so, but it's common to have a slightly shorter or longer cycle than this (from 24 to 35 days). Some women don't always have a regular menstrual cycle. Their period may be early or late, and how long it lasts and how heavy it is may vary each time. Read more about irregular periods and heavy periods. This page covers: Why your periods might stop When to see your GP Why your periods might stop There are a number of reasons why your periods can stop. The most common reasons are: pregnancy  stress  sudden weight loss  being overweight or obese extreme overexercising  taking the contraceptive pill reaching the menopause  polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)  Periods can also sometimes stop as a result of a long-term medical condition, such as heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes, an overactive thyroid, or premature ovarian failure. Pregnancy You might be pregnant if you're sexually active and your period is late. Pregnancy is a common reason why periods unexpectedly stop. It can sometimes happen if the contraception you're using fails. It might be that your period is simply late, so you could wait a few days to see if it arrives. If it doesn't arrive, you can do a pregnancy test to confirm whether or not you're pregnant. It's important to be aware that you can get pregnant in the days after your period is normally due. This can happen if the release of an egg (ovulation) is delayed \u2013 for example, as a result of illness or stress. Stress If you're stressed, your menstrual cycle can become longer or shorter, your periods may stop altogether, or they might become more painful. Try to avoid becoming stressed by making sure you have time to relax. Regular exercise, such as running, swimming and yoga, can help you relax. Breathing exercises can also help. If you're finding it hard to cope with stress, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be recommended. CBT is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and act. Sudden weight loss Excessive or sudden weight loss can cause your periods to stop. Severely restricting the amount of calories you eat stops the production of hormones needed for ovulation. Your GP may refer you to a dietitian if you're underweight, where you have a body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5. The dietitian will be able to advise you about how to regain weight safely. If your weight loss is caused by an eating disorder, such as anorexia, you'll be referred to a psychiatrist. Being overweight or obese Being overweight or obese can also affect your menstrual cycle. If you're overweight, your body may produce an excess amount of oestrogen, one of the hormones that regulate the reproductive system in women. The excess oestrogen can affect how often you have periods, and can also cause your periods to stop. Your GP may refer you to a dietitian if you're overweight or obese, with a BMI of 30 or more, and it's affecting your periods. The dietitian will be able to advise you about losing weight safely. Extreme overexercising The stress that intense physical activity places on your body can affect the hormones responsible for your periods. Losing too much body fat through intense exercise can also stop you ovulating. You'll be advised to reduce your level of activity if excessive exercise has caused your periods to stop. If you're a professional athlete, you may benefit from seeing a doctor who specialises in sports medicine. They'll be able to give you advice about how to maintain your performance without disrupting your periods. Contraceptive pill You might miss a period every so often if you're taking the contraceptive pill. This isn't usually a cause for concern. Some types of contraception, such as the progestogen-only pill, contraceptive injection and intrauterine system (IUS), particularly Mirena, can cause periods to stop altogether. However, your periods should return when you stop using these types of contraception. Menopause You may start missing periods as you approach the menopause. This is because oestrogen levels will start to decrease, and ovulation will become less regular. After the menopause, your periods will stop completely. The menopause is a natural part of the ageing process in women, which usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55. The average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 51 in the UK. However, around 1 in 100 women experience the menopause before the age of 40. This is known as premature menopause or premature ovarian failure. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Polycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless follicles, which are underdeveloped sacs in which eggs develop. If you have PCOS, these sacs are often unable to release an egg, which means ovulation doesn't take place. PCOS is thought to be very common, affecting about 1 in every 10 women in the UK. The condition is responsible for as many as one in three cases of stopped periods. When to see your GP See your GP if you're not pregnant \u2013 you've had a negative pregnancy test \u2013 and you've missed more than three periods in a row. If you're sexually active and you haven't taken a pregnancy test, your GP may advise you to take one. They may also ask you about: your medical history your family's medical history your sexual history any emotional issues you're having any recent changes in your body weight the amount of exercise you do Your GP may recommend waiting to see whether your periods return on their own. In some cases you may need treatment for your periods to return. You should also see your GP if your periods stop before you're 45 or you're still bleeding when you're over 55. Referral to a specialist If your GP thinks an underlying medical condition might have caused your periods to stop, they may refer you to a specialist. Depending on what your GP suspects is causing the problem, you may be referred to: a gynaecologist \u2013 a specialist in treating conditions that affect the female reproductive system an endocrinologist \u2013 a specialist in treating hormonal conditions You may have a full gynaecological examination and various tests, including: blood tests \u2013 to see whether you have abnormal levels of certain hormones, such as prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, or luteinising hormone an ultrasound scan, CT scan or MRI scan \u2013 to identify any problems with your reproductive system or the pituitary gland in your brain  Treating underlying conditions If test results indicate an underlying medical condition has caused your periods to stop, you may be offered treatment for your condition. For example, if the cause is PCOS, you may be advised to take the contraceptive pill or tablets containing a hormone called progesterone. Read more about the treatment of PCOS. If the cause is early menopause (premature ovarian failure), this means the ovaries no longer function normally. Hormone medication is usually recommended. Treatments to try include the contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Read about Johanna's experience of premature ovarian failure. If you have an overactive thyroid gland, you may be given medication to stop your thyroid gland producing too many hormones.  Read more about treating an overactive thyroid gland.

It could be something that happened seconds or minutes ago, or a memorable event that occurred in the past. The loss of memory may have started suddenly, or it may have been getting worse over the last year or so. It's normal to become a bit forgetful as you get older. However, memory loss could be a symptom of something more serious and should be checked by a GP. Memory loss can be distressing for the person affected, and their family. Relatives may fear the worst and assume it's caused by dementia, but this often isn't the case. The following information will tell you: what to do if you're worried about memory loss how to tell if it could be caused by dementia the most common causes of memory loss (but don't rely on this to self-diagnose a condition) how to cope with a poor memory What to do if you're worried about memory loss See your GP if you're worried because you or someone you care for has lost their memory. They'll do an initial assessment and ask questions about symptoms, family history and lifestyle. They may also arrange a blood test. Memory loss has a wide range of possible causes, depending on the type of memory loss. Doctors classify memories as either: immediate memories \u2013 such as sounds, which are only stored for a few seconds short-term or recent memories \u2013 such as telephone numbers, which stay in your memory for 15 to 20 seconds; the brain can store about seven chunks of short-term information at any time long-term or remote memories \u2013 more permanent memories, which have been reinforced because you've repeatedly gone over them in your mind If your GP thinks you or your relative needs an assessment for dementia, or that there may be another more serious underlying condition, such as brain damage, they'll refer you to a specialist. Could memory loss be dementia? If you're reading this because you think your memory problems may be a sign of dementia, rest assured that they probably aren't. A person with dementia won't usually be aware of their memory loss, or may deny it. Your memory loss is likely to be caused by something much more common and treatable, such as depression. You may be worried that someone you care for has dementia. However, bear in mind around 40% of people over 65 have some type of memory problem, and only 15% will develop dementia each year. If your instincts are correct, their denial or lack of awareness of their memory loss can make it difficult to convince them to see a GP. This fact sheet includes information about how to persuade your relative to see a doctor (PDF, 848kb). Signs that someone has dementia As a general guide: Dementia usually occurs in people over the age of 65. The memory loss doesn't happen suddenly, but gets gradually worse over time. Someone with dementia will struggle to remember immediate or recent events, but can still recall events that happened a long time ago. This means that if their long-term memory is affected, it probably isn't dementia. Read more about the symptoms of dementia. Common causes of memory loss GPs often find that people who see them about memory loss are most likely to have: anxiety stress depression Their memory loss is a result of poor concentration and not noticing things in the first place because of a lack of interest. Sleeping problems often make the memory loss worse. Your GP may suggest trying antidepressants. If you have depression or anxiety, your memory problems should get better as the depression or anxiety improves. An elderly person with memory loss is likely to have depression if they also experience changes in behaviour, such as hoarding or being bad tempered. Other common causes of memory loss are: a head injury \u2013 for example, after a car accident a stroke \u2013 this cuts off some of the blood supply to the brain and causes brain tissue to die These will cause sudden memory loss, where you either forget events that happened before the trauma (retrograde amnesia), or you forget everything that happened after the trauma (anterograde amnesia).  Less common causes of memory loss Less commonly, memory loss can be caused by: an underactive thyroid \u2013 where your thyroid gland (found in the neck) doesn't produce enough hormones certain types of medication, such as sedatives and some treatments for Parkinson's disease long-term alcohol misuse bleeding in the brain (subarachnoid haemorrhage) vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency \u2013 for example, as the result of a digestive problem transient global amnesia \u2013 problems with blood flow to part of the brain, which causes sudden episodes of memory loss that a person can't recall afterwards  psychogenic amnesia \u2013 a stressful or traumatic event that causes someone to block out the memory, leaving them unable to remember important information a brain tumour Click on the links above for more information about these conditions. Tips for coping with a poor memory Keep everyday items, such as car keys, in the same place and try to do things in the same order each time. Write information down, and keep paper and a pencil near the phone. Keep a diary at home as well as at work to remind you to do daily tasks. Use an alarm to help you remember to do something in the future, such as taking something out of the oven. Repeat important information you need to remember back to someone.

It involves removing and testing a small sample of cells from amniotic fluid, which surrounds the foetus in the womb (uterus). When amniocentesis is offered Amniocentesis isn't routinely offered to all pregnant women. It's only offered if there's a high risk your baby could have a genetic condition. This could be because: an earlier antenatal screening test has suggested there may be a problem, such as Down's syndrome, spina bifida or sickle cell anaemia you've had a previous pregnancy with these problems you have a family history of a genetic condition, such as cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy, and an abnormality is detected in your baby during a routine ultrasound scan It's important to remember that you don't have to have amniocentesis if it's offered. It's up to you to decide whether you want it. Your midwife or doctor will speak to you about what the test involves, and let you know what the possible benefits and risks are, to help you make a decision. Read more about why amniocentesis is offered and deciding whether to have it. How amniocentesis is performed Amniocentesis is usually carried out between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy, but may be performed later than this if necessary. Although it can be performed earlier, this may increase the risk of complications of amniocentesis and is usually avoided. During the test, a long, thin needle is inserted through your abdominal wall, guided by an ultrasound image. The needle is passed into the amniotic sac that surrounds the foetus and a small sample of amniotic fluid is removed for analysis. The test itself usually takes about 10 minutes, although the whole consultation may take about 30 minutes. Amniocentesis is usually described as being uncomfortable rather than painful. Some women describe experiencing a pain similar to period pain or feeling pressure when the needle is taken out. Read more about what happens during amniocentesis. Getting your results The first results of the test should be available within three working days and this will tell you whether Down's, Edward's or Patau's syndrome has been discovered. If rarer conditions are also being tested for, it can take two to three weeks or more for the results to come back. If your test shows that your baby has a serious inherited or genetic disorder, the implications will be fully discussed with you. There's no cure for most of the conditions amniocentesis finds, so you'll need to consider your options carefully. You may choose to continue with your pregnancy, while gathering information about the condition so you're fully prepared, or you may consider having a termination (abortion). Read more about the results of amniocentesis. What are the risks of amniocentesis? Before you decide to have amniocentesis, the risks and possible complications will be discussed with you. One of the main risks associated with amniocentesis is miscarriage, which is the loss of the pregnancy in the first 23 weeks. This is estimated to occur in 1% of women who have amniocentesis. There are also some other risks, such as infection or needing to have the procedure again because it wasn't possible to accurately test the first sample that was removed. The risk of amniocentesis causing complications is higher if it's carried out before the 15th week of pregnancy, which is why the test is only carried out after this point. Read more about the possible complications of amniocentesis. What are the alternatives? An alternative to amniocentesis is a test called chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This is where a small sample of cells from the placenta (the organ that links the mother's blood supply with her unborn baby's) are removed for testing. It's usually carried out between the 11th and 14th weeks of pregnancy, although it can be performed later than this if necessary. With CVS, the risk of miscarriage is about 1-2%, which is slightly higher than the risk of miscarriage for amniocentesis. However, as the test can be carried out earlier, you'll have more time to consider the results. If you're offered tests to look for a genetic disorder in your baby, a specialist involved in carrying out the test will be able to discuss the different options with you, and help you make a decision.

An abnormal amount of fluid (whether increased or reduced) might be suspected by your healthcare professional after 30 weeks of pregnancy, during one of your antenatal appointments, and should be monitored and investigated. The cause of polyhydramnios is often unknown, but sometimes indicates a problem with the baby's development (see What are the causes?, below). However, most women with polyhydramnios give birth to healthy babies. If you're pregnant and notice your belly is getting large very quickly (acute polyhydramnios), contact your doctor or midwife. It's rare for it to happen suddenly, but it can indicate an abnormality with the foetus and increases your risk of giving birth prematurely. This page covers: How is polyhydramnios diagnosed?  What are the causes?  What associated risks should I be aware of?  How is it investigated and managed?  How is polyhydramnios diagnosed?  In most women with polyhydramnios, the excess fluid builds up slowly. After 30 weeks of pregnancy, this excess fluid should be noticeable and picked up by your GP, midwife or obstetrician during one of your antenatal appointments. In rare cases, when polyhydramnios develops very quickly, the excess fluid may be apparent earlier in pregnancy, or might be noted at the time of the detailed scan at 18-22 weeks. If increased amniotic fluid is suspected, you may be referred for an ultrasound scan, so that the depth of the amniotic fluid surrounding the foetus can be measured. What are the causes?  Often, no cause can be found for polyhydramnios. However, it can be associated with any of the following: The mother carrying twins (read about giving birth to twins).  The mother having diabetes, including gestational diabetes (pregnancy-related diabetes). Sometimes, if diabetes is the cause, the baby will be larger than expected for its stage of development. A blockage in part of the baby's gut (a condition called gut atresia), which prevents them absorbing the usual amount of amniotic fluid. A gut atresia would often require an operation after the baby's birth (read more about gut atresia in babies). The mother having rhesus disease, where antibodies in the mother's blood cross the placenta, sometimes causing anaemia in the foetus.   A growth of blood vessels on the placenta, called a chorioangioma. A build-up of fluid in specific areas of the baby's body, such as the abdomen and chest cavity, called hydrops fetalis. A genetic problem with the foetus. What associated risks should I be aware of?  Having polyhydramnios means there's a slightly higher risk of your unborn baby having a birth defect, especially if the fluid build-up is severe. You should discuss with your healthcare professionals any other problems that the extra fluid could be linked to. However, don't panic \u2013 the vast majority of women with polyhydramnios give birth to healthy babies. Your labour may be affected in the following ways: You may go into premature labour because of the additional pressure stretching the womb. Your baby may be in the wrong position and you may need a caesarean section. If your baby is in the wrong position, the umbilical cord may slip down into the birth canal when the membranes rupture (read more about a prolapsed umbilical cord). You may have an increased risk of bleeding after delivery. How is it investigated and managed?  Most women with polyhydramnios need an ultrasound investigation and a glucose tolerance test, to try to identify a cause and check for gestational diabetes.  If your condition isn't severe, this can be done in the GP's surgery and you may not need to be admitted to hospital. Read more about ultrasound scans in pregnancy. If the ultrasound scan appears to show a problem with the foetus, doctors might discuss whether you want to have amniocentesis (where a sample of fluid is drawn out using a needle), to test for chromosomal or genetic problems in the foetus.  Your doctor may also recommend a period of bed rest to help reduce your risk of giving birth prematurely, if you're at risk. During and after labour Your doctors and midwives will usually recommend giving birth to the baby in hospital, where more emergency treatment options are available. They may also recommend close monitoring of the baby's heart rate in labour. If your baby appears normal after birth, your doctor might suggest passing a tube down your baby's throat to check them for internal problems, such as a problem with the development of their gullet (oesophageal atresia). Read general information about your baby after the birth. Amniotic fluid: what does it do?  During pregnancy, the unborn baby (foetus) floats inside a fluid-filled sac in the womb. Amniotic fluid has several important roles: it protects the foetus from outside injury by cushioning sudden blows and movements it helps the foetus to move in the womb, allowing for proper bone growth it helps the foetus' lungs develop properly it keeps the temperature relatively constant around the foetus The fluid constantly moves around as the foetus swallows it and releases it through urine.   Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 19\/03\/2015 Next review due: 19\/03\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Other symptoms of dysentery can include: painful stomach cramps nausea or vomiting a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above, or 37.5C (99.5F) or above in children under five In the UK, most people with dysentery only experience mild symptoms. It's not always necessary to see a GP, as it tends to clear up within a week or so. See your GP if your symptoms are severe or don't start to improve after a few days. Tell them if you have recently been abroad. Treating dysentery Treatment isn't normally needed, as it usually clears up on its own. However, it's important to make sure you drink plenty of fluids and use oral rehydration solutions (ORS) if necessary, to avoid dehydration. See treating diarrhoea for more information on this. Over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol can help to relieve pain and a fever. It's best to avoid antidiarrhoeal medications such as loperamide, as they can make things worse. You should stay at home until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea, to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to others. If your symptoms are severe or persistent, your GP may prescribe a short course of antibiotics. In severe cases, you may need to be treated in hospital for a few days. What causes dysentery? There are two main types of dysentery: bacillary dysentery or shigellosis \u2013 caused by shigella bacteria; this is the most common type of dysentery in the UK amoebic dysentery or amoebiasis \u2013 caused by an amoeba (single-celled parasite) called Entamoeba histolytica, that's found mainly in tropical areas; this type of dysentery is usually picked up abroad Both types of dysentery are highly infectious and can be passed on if the poo of an infected person gets into another person's mouth. This can happen if someone with the infection doesn't wash their hands after going to the toilet and then touches food, surfaces, or another person. In the UK, the infection usually affects groups of people in close contact, such as families, schools and nurseries. There is also a chance of picking up the infection through anal or anal-oral sex (\"rimming\"). In developing countries with poor sanitation, infected poo may contaminate the water supply or food (particularly cold, uncooked food). Preventing dysentery You can reduce your risk of getting dysentery with good hygiene. You should: wash your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet, and regularly throughout the day wash your hands before handling, eating or cooking food avoid sharing towels wash the laundry of an infected person on the hottest setting possible Read more about food safety and hygiene in the home. If you're travelling to a country where there is a high risk of getting dysentery, the advice below can help to prevent infection. Don't drink the local water unless you're sure that it's sterile (clean) \u2013 safe alternatives are bottled water or drinks in sealed cans or bottles. If the water is not sterile, boil it for several minutes or use chemical disinfectant or a reliable filter. Don't clean your teeth with tap water. Don't have ice in your drinks, because it may be made from unclean water. Avoid fresh fruit or vegetables that can't be peeled before eating. Avoid food and drink sold by street vendors (except drinks from properly sealed cans or bottles). Read more about food and water safety abroad.

This topic may be helpful if you or a member of your family has recently had an amputation or is about to have one. It covers: Why an amputation may be needed Assessment before surgery How amputations are carried out Recovery Prosthetics Stump care Complications Psychological impact Help and support Why amputation may be needed An amputation may be needed if: you have a severe infection in your limb your limb has been affected by gangrene (often as a result of peripheral arterial disease)  there's serious trauma to your limb, such as a crush or blast wound your limb is deformed and has limited movement and function Assessment before surgery Unless you need to have an emergency amputation, you'll be fully assessed before surgery to identify the most suitable type of amputation and any factors that may affect your rehabilitation. The assessment is likely to include: a thorough medical examination \u2013 assessing your physical condition, nutritional status, bowel and bladder function, your cardiovascular system (heart, blood and blood vessels) and your respiratory system (lungs and airways) an assessment of the condition and function of your healthy limb \u2013 removing one limb can place extra strain on the remaining limb, so it's important to look after the healthy limb  a psychological assessment \u2013 to determine how well you'll cope with the psychological and emotional impact of amputation, and whether you'll need additional support an assessment of your home, work and social environments \u2013 to determine whether any additional provisions will need to be made to help you cope You'll also be introduced to a physiotherapist, who will be involved in your post-operative care. A prosthetist (a specialist in prosthetic limbs) will advise you about the type and function of prosthetic limbs or other devices available. If you're having a planned amputation, you might find it reassuring to talk to someone who's had a similar type of amputation. A member of your care team may be able to put you in touch with someone. How amputations are carried out Amputations can be carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're unconscious) or using an epidural anaesthetic (which numbs the lower half of the body). Once the limb has been removed, a number of additional techniques can be used to help improve the function of the remaining limb and reduce the risk of complications. These include shortening and smoothing the bone in your remaining limb so it's covered by an adequate amount of soft tissue and muscle, and stitching the remaining muscle to the bones to help strengthen your remaining limb (a technique known as myodesis). After the amputation, your wound will be sealed with stitches or surgical staples. It will be covered with a bandage and a tube may be placed under your skin to drain away any excess fluid. The bandage will usually need to be kept in place for a few days to reduce the risk of infection. Recovering after an amputation After surgery, you'll usually be given oxygen through a mask and fluids through a drip for the first few days while you recover on the ward. A small flexible tube (a urinary catheter) may be placed in your bladder during surgery to drain away urine. This means you won't need to worry about going to the toilet for the first few days after surgery. The site of the operation may be painful, so you'll be given painkillers if you need them. Tell a member of your care team if the painkillers aren't working, as you may need a larger dose or a stronger painkiller. A small tube may be used to deliver local anaesthetic to the nerves in your stump to help reduce pain. Your physiotherapist will teach you some exercises to help prevent blood clots and improve your blood supply while you're recovering in hospital. Compression garments You'll notice swelling (oedema) of your stump after surgery. This is normal and it may continue after you've been discharged. Using a compression garment will help with swelling and the shape of the stump. It may also reduce phantom pain and help support the limb. You'll be fitted with a compression garment once your wound has healed. It should be worn every day, but taken off at bedtime. You should be given at least two garments, which should be washed regularly. Rehabilitation Physical rehabilitation is an important part of the recovery process. It can be a long, difficult and frustrating process, but it's important to persevere. After rehabilitation, you should be able to return to work and other activities. Your rehabilitation programme will be tailored to your individual needs and requirements, and will aim to allow you to carry out as many of your normal activities as possible. You'll work closely with physiotherapists and occupational therapists who will discuss with you what you'd like to achieve from rehabilitation so that some realistic goals can be set. Your rehabilitation programme will usually start within a few days of surgery, beginning with some simple exercises you can do while lying down or sitting. If you've had a leg amputation, you'll be encouraged to move around as soon as possible using a wheelchair. You'll also be taught \"transfer techniques\" to help you move around more easily, such as how to get into a wheelchair from your bed. Once your wound has started to heal, you may start working on an exercise programme with a physiotherapist in the hospital gym to help you maintain your mobility and muscle strength. If you have a prosthetic limb fitted (see below), your physiotherapist will teach you how to use it \u2013 for example, how to walk on a prosthetic leg or grip with a prosthetic hand. Going home and follow-up The length of time it will take before you're ready to go home will depend on the type of amputation you've had and your general state of health. Before you're discharged from hospital, an occupational therapist may arrange to visit you at home to see whether your home environment needs to be adapted to make it more accessible. For example, you may need a wheelchair ramp or a stairlift. If these types of modifications are required, the issue can be referred to your local social services department. Read about mobility, wheelchairs and scooters and assessing your care and support needs. It can take several months before you're fitted with a prosthetic limb (if you're a suitable for one), so you may be given a wheelchair to help you get around if you've had a lower limb amputation. You'll probably need to attend a follow-up appointment a few weeks after being discharged to discuss how well you're coping at home and whether you require additional help, support or equipment. At your appointment, you may also be given details of your nearest amputee support group, made up of both healthcare professionals and people living with an amputation. Prosthetics After an amputation, you may be able to have a prosthetic limb fitted. Prosthetic limbs aren't suitable for everyone who's had an amputation because an extensive course of physiotherapy and rehabilitation is required (see below). Adjusting to life with a prosthetic limb takes a considerable amount of energy because you have to compensate for the loss of muscle and bone in the amputated limb. This is why frail people or those with a serious health condition, such as heart disease, may not be suitable for a prosthetic limb. If you're able to have a prosthetic limb, the type of limb that's recommended for you will depend on: the type of amputation you had the amount of muscle strength in the remaining section of the limb your general state of health tasks the prosthetic limb will be expected to perform  whether you want the limb to look as real as possible or whether you're more concerned with function If it's thought that you would find it difficult to withstand the strain of using a prosthetic limb, a purely cosmetic limb may be recommended. This is a limb that looks like a real limb, but can't be used. It's possible to have a prosthetic limb that's both physically realistic and functional, but there may have to be an element of compromise between the two. Preparing to have a prosthetic limb fitted If a prosthetic limb is suitable for you, you'll begin a programme of activities while still in hospital to prepare for the prosthetic. Before a prosthetic limb is fitted, the skin covering your stump may be made less sensitive (known as desensitisation). This will make the prosthetic more comfortable to wear. Skin desensitisation involves the following steps: gently tapping the skin with a face cloth using compression bandages to help reduce swelling and prevent a build-up of fluid inside and around your stump rubbing and pulling the skin around your bone to prevent excessive scarring Your physiotherapist will teach you a range of exercises to strengthen the muscles in your remaining limb and improve your general energy levels, so you're able to cope better with the demands of an artificial limb. Depending on what's available in your local area, it can be several months before you get your first appointment with a prosthetist (specialist in prosthetic limbs). Stump care It's very important to keep the skin on the surface of your stump clean to reduce the risk of it becoming irritated or infected. Gently wash your stump at least once a day (more frequently in hot weather) with mild unscented soap and warm water, and dry it carefully. If you have a prosthetic limb, you should also regularly clean the socket using soap and warm water. When taking a bath, avoid leaving your stump submerged in water for long periods because the water will soften the skin on your stump, making it more vulnerable to injury. If your skin becomes dry, use a moisturising cream before bedtime or when you're not wearing your prosthesis. Some people find wearing one or more socks around their stump helps absorb sweat and reduces skin irritation. The size of your stump may change as the swelling goes down, so the number of socks you need to use may vary. You should change the socks every day. Check your stump carefully every day for signs of infection, such as: warm, red and tender skin discharge of fluid or pus increasing swelling Contact your care team for advice if you think you may be developing a skin infection. Caring for your remaining limb After having a leg or foot amputated, it's very important to avoid injuring your remaining \"good\" leg and foot, particularly if your amputation was needed because of diabetes. Your remaining leg and foot may also be at risk. Avoid wearing poorly fitting footwear and ensure that an appropriately trained healthcare professional, such as a podiatrist, is involved in the care of your remaining foot. You should also be offered a regular review of your foot by the foot care team. Read more about diabetes and foot care. Complications Like any type of surgery, an amputation carries a risk of complications. It also carries a risk of additional problems directly related to the loss of a limb. There are a number of factors that influence the risk of complications from amputation, such as your age, the type of amputation you've had, and your general health. The risk of serious complications is lower in planned amputations than in emergency amputations. Complications associated with having an amputation include: heart complications \u2013 such as heart attack deep vein thrombosis (DVT) slow wound healing and wound infection pneumonia stump and \"phantom limb\" pain In some cases, further surgery may be needed to correct problems that develop or to help relieve pain. For example, if neuromas (thickened nerve tissue) are thought to be causing pain, the affected cluster of nerves may need to be removed. Stump and \"phantom limb\" pain Many people who have an amputation experience some degree of stump pain or \"phantom limb\" pain. Phantom limb sensations are sensations that seem to be coming from the amputated limb. Occasionally, these can be painful (phantom limb pain). The term \"phantom\" doesn't mean the painful symptoms are imaginary. Phantom limb pain is a real phenomenon, which has been confirmed using brain imaging scans to study how nerve signals are transmitted to the brain. The symptoms of phantom limb pain can range from mild to severe. Some people have described brief \"flashes\" of mild pain, similar to an electric shock, that last for a few seconds. Others have described constant severe pain. Stump pain can have many different causes, including rubbing or sores where the stump touches a prosthetic limb, nerve damage during surgery and the development of neuromas. Treating stump and phantom limb pain Stump and phantom limb pain will usually improve over time, but treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms. Medications Medications that may be used to help relieve pain include: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \u2013 such as ibuprofen anticonvulsants \u2013 such as carbamazepine or gabapentin antidepressants \u2013 such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline (these medications work directly on the nerves in your leg)  opioids \u2013 such as codeine or morphine corticosteroid or local anaesthetic injections Self-help measures and complementary therapy There are several non-invasive techniques that may help relieve pain in some people. They include:  checking the fit of your prosthesis and making adjustments to make it feel more comfortable applying heat or cold to your limb, such as using heat or ice packs, rubs and creams massage \u2013 to increase circulation and stimulate muscles acupuncture \u2013 thought to stimulate the nervous system and relieve pain transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) \u2013 where a small, battery-operated device is used to deliver electrical impulses to the affected area of your body, to block or reduce pain signals mental imagery (see below) Research has shown that people who spend 40 minutes a day imagining using their phantom limb, such as stretching out their \"fingers\" or bunching up their \"toes\", experience a reduction in pain symptoms. This may be related to the central theory of phantom limb pain (that the brain is looking to receive feedback from the amputated limb), and these mental exercises may provide an effective substitution for this missing feedback. Another technique, known as mirror visual feedback, involves using a mirror to create a reflection of the other limb. Some people find that exercising and moving their other limb can help relieve the pain from a phantom limb. Psychological impact of amputation The loss of a limb can have a considerable psychological impact. Many people who've had an amputation report feeling emotions such as grief and bereavement, similar to experiencing the death of a loved one. Coming to terms with the psychological impact of an amputation is therefore often as important as coping with the physical demands. Having an amputation can have a considerable psychological impact for three main reasons: you have to cope with the loss of sensation from your amputated limb you have to cope with the loss of function from your amputated limb your sense of body image, and other people's perception of your body image, has changed Negative thoughts and emotions are common after an amputation. This is particularly true in people who've had an emergency amputation because they don't have time to mentally prepare for the effects of surgery. Common negative emotions and thoughts experienced by people after an amputation include: depression anxiety denial (refusing to accept that they need to make changes, such as having physiotherapy, to adapt to life with an amputation) grief feeling suicidal People who've had an amputation as a result of trauma (particularly members of the armed forces) also have an increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Talk to your care team about your thoughts and feelings, particularly if you're feeling depressed or suicidal. You may need additional treatment, such as antidepressants or counselling, to improve your ability to cope after having an amputation. Help and support Being told you need to have a limb amputated can be a devastating and frightening experience. Adjusting to life after an amputation can be challenging, but many people enjoy a good quality of life once they have managed to adapt. You may find it useful to contact a support group for people living with amputations. The Limbless Association can provide you with information and advice, as well as the details of various local support groups. Its phone number is 0800 644 0185 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm). You may also find the Douglas Bader Foundation (DBF) a useful source of information and advice.

Proteins begin as a string of amino acids that fold themselves into a three-dimensional shape. This 'protein folding' allows them to perform useful functions within our cells. Amyloid is a description of proteins which have folded abnormally and then collected together. In this form they do not break down as easily as normal proteins and can build up in tissues and organs. If this build-up causes the tissues or organs to stop working properly, the resulting conditions are called amyloidosis. The amyloid deposits occasionally only affect one part of the body (localised amyloidosis), but more often several different part of the body are affected (systemic amyloidosis), such as the heart, kidneys, liver, or nerves. Without treatment to address the underlying cause, the amyloid deposits can eventually lead to organ failure and death \u2013 sometimes within only a year or two. There are around 30 different proteins that can misfold and form amyloid, which is why there are many different types of amyloidosis. Overall, about 600 new cases of amyloidosis are diagnosed in the UK every year and most occur in older people. This page will focus on the most common type in the UK, called AL amyloidosis (previously known as primary amyloidosis). Signs and symptoms of AL amyloidosis AL amyloidosis can affect any organ, and the symptoms depend on which organs are affected. Most often amyloid is deposited in the kidneys and may cause kidney failure. Symptoms of kidney failure can include fluid retention (oedema), tiredness, weakness and loss of appetite. Amyloid deposited in the heart can cause it to become enlarged and impair its ability to pump blood efficiently around the body. This may result in heart failure, which can cause symptoms such as cause shortness of breath and oedema. Some of the other possible signs and symptoms of AL amyloidosis include: feeling lightheaded or fainting, particularly after standing or sitting up numbness or a tingling feeling in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy) frothy urine an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) chest pain (angina) in men, erectile dysfunction diarrhoea or constipation blood spots on the skin carpal tunnel syndrome \u2013 compression of the nerve in your wrist an enlarged tongue AL amyloidosis doesn\u2019t usually cause any problems with memory loss, thinking speed, language, understanding, or judgement. What causes AL amyloidosis? AL amyloidosis occurs when an abnormality in the plasma cells found in bone marrow (the spongy tissue at the centre of some bones) results in the excessive production of proteins called 'light chains'. Normally, light chains form part of antibodies (proteins that help protect the body from illness and infection), but in cases of AL amyloidosis, large numbers of misfolded light chains are produced and these clump together into thread-like fibres that the body cannot clear away easily. These fibres typically then gradually start to form deposits in the heart, kidneys, nerves, or liver. The abnormal white blood cells in the bone marrow are usually benign (non-cancerous), but some cases of AL amyloidosis are linked to a type of bone marrow cancer called multiple myeloma. Unlike some other types of amyloidosis, AL amyloidosis is not inherited, so a person with the condition cannot pass it on to their children. Diagnosing AL amyloidosis Diagnosis of AL amyloidosis can be challenging, since the symptoms are often very general. The diagnosis can be confirmed by removing a biopsy (small tissue sample) from the affected part of the body, and examining this under a microscope in the laboratory, using special stains to check for amyloid proteins. How the tissue sample is removed will depend on which parts of the body are affected. In some people with suspected anyloidosis, a biopsy of tummy fat (taken using a needle) or a biopsy from the gut (taken during an endoscopy) may give a positive result. Other tests Further diagnostic tests are also available at the NHS National Amyloidosis Centre at the Royal Free Hospital in London. These include a type of scan called SAP scintigraphy, which involves being injected with a mildly radioactive version of blood protein before being scanned with a gamma camera. This protein coats any amyloid deposits in your body, which highlights most areas of the body affected by amyloid deposits. You may also have further tests to assess how the amyloid deposits have affected your individual organs. For example, an echocardiogram (heart ultrasound scan) may be carried out to check the condition of your heart. Treating AL amyloidosis There are currently no treatments available that can directly remove the amyloid deposits associated with AL amyloidosis. Treatment aims to prevent the further production of abnormal light chains while monitoring and treating any problems affecting your organs. This can give your body enough time to gradually clear the deposits before they build up again and can help prevent organ damage. In most cases, this will involve having chemotherapy to damage the abnormal bone marrow cells and inhibit production of the abnormal proteins. You will also need treatment for organ failure \u2013 for example, you may need diuretic medication to treat heart failure and you may need dialysis if you have kidney failure.  Some people with kidney failure may be suitable to receive a kidney transplant, although the underlying bone marrow disorder will need to be suppressed by chemotherapy to prevent build-up of amyloid in the new kidney. After chemotherapy, you will need regular check-ups every six to 12 months to look for signs of the condition returning (relapsing). If it does relapse at any stage, chemotherapy may need to be started again. Outlook Before effective treatments for AL amyloidosis were discovered, the outlook for the condition was poor, with many people only living for a few months. With modern treatments, the outlook varies depending on the extent of the amyloid deposits, your age and general health, and how well you respond to treatment. Overall, many people with AL amyloidosis now survive for several years after they are diagnosed with the condition and increasing numbers of people are living for a decade or more. Information about you If you have amyloidosis, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

This leads to muscle weakness, often with visible wasting. Motor neurone disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), occurs when specialist nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord called motor neurones stop working properly. This is known as neurodegeneration. Motor neurones control important muscle activity, such as: gripping walking speaking swallowing breathing As the condition progresses, people with motor neurone disease will find some or all of these activities increasingly difficult. Eventually, they may become impossible. It's not clear what causes motor neurones to stop working properly. In about 5% of cases there's a family history of either motor neurone disease or a related condition called frontotemporal dementia. This is known as familial motor neurone disease. In most of these cases, faulty genes have been identified as making a major contribution to the development of the condition. There's no single test to diagnose motor neurone disease and diagnosis is based mainly on the opinion of a brain and nervous system specialist (a neurologist). The diagnosis of motor neurone disease is usually clear to an experienced neurologist, but sometimes specialised tests are needed to rule out other conditions with similar features. Read more about the causes of motor neurone disease and diagnosing motor neurone disease. Progression of symptoms The symptoms of motor neurone disease begin gradually over weeks and months, usually on one side of the body initially, and get progressively worse. Common early symptoms include: a weakened grip, which can cause difficulty picking up or holding objects weakness at the shoulder that makes lifting the arm difficult a \"foot drop\" caused by weak ankle muscles dragging of the leg slurred speech (dysarthria) The condition isn't usually painful. As damage progresses, symptoms spread to other parts of the body and the condition becomes more debilitating. Eventually, a person with motor neurone disease may be unable to move. Communicating, swallowing and breathing may also become very difficult. In up to 15% of cases, motor neurone disease is associated with a type of dementia that can affect personality and behaviour. This is called frontotemporal dementia, and is often an early feature when it occurs in motor neurone disease. The affected person may not realise that their personality or behaviour is different. Who's affected by motor neurone disease? Motor neurone disease is a rare condition that affects around two in every 100,000 people in the UK each year. There are about 5,000 people living with the condition in the UK at any one time. The condition can affect adults of all ages, including teenagers, although this is extremely rare. It's usually diagnosed in people over 40, but most people with the condition first develop symptoms in their 60s. It affects slightly more men than women. Treating motor neurone disease There's currently no cure for motor neurone disease. Treatment aims to: make the person feel comfortable and have the best quality of life possible compensate for the progressive loss of bodily functions such as mobility, communication, swallowing and breathing For example, a breathing mask can greatly help the symptoms of breathing and weakness, and a feeding tube (called a gastrostomy) helps maintain nutrition and overall comfort. If necessary, medication can be used to help control excessive drooling. A medication called riluzole has shown a very small improvement in patients' overall survival, but it isn't a cure and doesn't stop the condition progressing. Read more about treating motor neurone disease. Survival rates Motor neurone disease is a severely life-shortening condition for most people. Life expectancy for about half of those with the condition is three years from the start of symptoms. However, some people may live for up to 10 years, and in rarer circumstances even longer. Living with motor neurone disease is extremely challenging and often a terrifying possibility before the diagnosis is made. However, it's not necessarily as bleak as people imagine. With strong community and specialist support, many people can maintain some independence for a significant part of the condition's course, and experience a quality of life they may not have imagined was possible at the time of their diagnosis. The end of life for someone with motor neurone disease isn't usually distressing and is most often in their own home. In most cases, a person with the condition will die in their sleep as the end stage of gradual weakness in their breathing muscles. Although some people with the condition will have swallowing problems, they won't choke to death. Advice and support The Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA) is the leading UK charity for people affected by the condition. The MNDA can give you information, practical advice and support about living with motor neurone disease and coping with the emotional impact of being diagnosed. The MNDA also run a network of specialist hospital clinics across the UK, where a neurologist who's an expert in motor neurone disease can provide you with further information and advice. Information about you If you have motor neurone disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).

If used in this way, they can cause serious side effects and addiction.  Anabolic steroids are manufactured drugs that mimic the effects of the male hormone testosterone. They have limited medical uses and aren't to be confused with corticosteroids, a different type of steroid drug that's commonly prescribed for a variety of conditions. This page explains the dangers of misusing anabolic steroids, and aims to advise and support those who are addicted to the drugs. It covers: anabolic steroids and the law why people misuse anabolic steroids how they are taken side effects addiction getting help Are anabolic steroids illegal? Anabolic steroids are class C drugs, which can only be sold by pharmacists with a prescription. It's not illegal to possess anabolic steroids for personal use. They can also be imported or exported, as long as this is carried out in person. This means they can't be posted or delivered by a courier or freight service. However, it's illegal to possess, import or export anabolic steroids if it's believed you're supplying or selling them. This includes giving them to friends. The penalty is an unlimited fine, or even a prison sentence. In professional sport, most organisations ban anabolic steroid use and test competitors for banned steroids. Why people misuse anabolic steroids Anabolic steroids are performance-enhancing drugs that increase muscle mass and decrease fat, as well as causing many undesirable effects. Some athletes, weightlifters and bodybuilders take them regularly to improve their physical performance and build up their bodies. However, people of all ages have been known to misuse these drugs, including adolescent boys who suffer from body dysmorphia, an anxiety disorder where the way someone thinks about their body doesn't match the way it looks. Teenage boys and young men may take the drugs because they have reverse anorexia. This is when they don't see themselves as being physically big enough or strong enough. Some people believe taking anabolic steroids will help them become fit and healthy. This isn't true: taking anabolic steroids is a dangerous drug habit. How anabolic steroids are taken Anabolic steroids are usually injected into the muscle, but some are available in tablet form, or as creams or gels that are applied to the skin. Most people who use anabolic steroids are aware of the dangers of taking them, and have ways of getting the desired effect without the undesirable side effects. This involves injecting the drugs for a period of time and then stopping for a rest period before starting again. This is known as \"cycling\". More than one type of anabolic steroid may be used at a time. Users believe this increases the effectiveness, and is known as \"stacking\". The term \"pyramiding\" refers to a combination of both stacking and cycling. One or more anabolic steroid is taken in a low dose. This is gradually increased to a maximum dose over 6 to 12 weeks, before the dose is reduced to zero to give the body a break and the cycle is started again. Users tend to exercise more when they're taking high doses to make the most of their improved performance during this time. Athletes have been known to try to time their injections so the drug is out of their system by the time they're drug tested. Side effects of anabolic steroids Regularly taking anabolic steroids causes a range of male features, not just increased muscle mass. It can also lead to potentially dangerous medical conditions, such as high blood pressure (hypertension) or heart attacks. Physical effects Effects of anabolic steroids in men can include: reduced sperm count infertility shrunken testicles erectile dysfunction baldness breast development increased risk of developing prostate cancer severe acne stomach pain In women, anabolic steroids can cause: facial hair growth and body hair loss of breasts swelling of the clitoris  a deepened voice an increased sex drive problems with periods hair loss severe acne In addition, both men and women who take anabolic steroids can develop any of the following medical conditions: heart attack or stroke liver or kidney tumours high blood pressure (hypertension)  blood clots  fluid retention high cholesterol   Psychological effects Misusing anabolic steroids can also cause the following psychological or emotional effects: aggressive behaviour  mood swings manic behaviour hallucinations and delusions Stunted growth in adolescents Anabolic steroids accelerate bone growth, so if they're misused by adolescents who haven't yet had the growth spurt associated with puberty, the drugs can cause premature ageing of the bones and restricted growth. Sharing needles As anabolic steroids are often injected, there are risks associated with sharing needles. These are the same risks associated with recreational drug use, and include: damage to veins, leading to ulcers or gangrene hepatitis B infection hepatitis C infection HIV transmission Addiction Like many other substances, anabolic steroids are addictive. This means you can crave the drug, require more to get the same effect, and have withdrawal symptoms if you suddenly stop taking them. A person who is addicted to anabolic steroids will continue using them despite experiencing unpleasant physical side effects. When doctors prescribe steroid medication, they always advise coming off the medication slowly by gradually reducing the dose. Coming off anabolic steroids suddenly can result in withdrawal symptoms that include: depression and apathy feelings of anxiety difficulty concentrating insomnia  anorexia  decreased sex drive extreme tiredness (fatigue) headaches  muscle and joint pain Getting help  You should see your GP if you think you're addicted to anabolic steroids. Treatment for an addiction to anabolic steroids will be similar to that of other types of addiction. Your GP may refer you to a specially trained drugs counsellor. They'll discuss your addiction with you, how to safely stop taking steroids, and any obstacles you may face when trying to stop, plus strategies for dealing with those obstacles.

Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body using a substance called haemoglobin. Anaemia is the general term for having either fewer red blood cells than normal or having an abnormally low amount of haemoglobin in each red blood cell. There are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. For example, iron deficiency anaemia, which occurs when the body doesn't contain enough iron. Symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency Vitamin B12 and folate perform several important functions in the body, including keeping the nervous system healthy. A deficiency in either of these vitamins can cause a wide range of problems, including: extreme tiredness a lack of energy pins and needles (paraesthesia) a sore and red tongue mouth ulcers muscle weakness disturbed vision psychological problems, which may include depression and confusion  problems with memory, understanding and judgement Some of these problems can also occur if you have a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate, but don't have anaemia. Read about the symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia. When to see your GP See your GP if you think you may have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These conditions can often be diagnosed based on your symptoms and the results of a blood test. It's important for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible because, although many of the symptoms improve with treatment, some problems caused by the condition can be irreversible. Read about diagnosing vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia. Causes of a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency There are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, including: pernicious anaemia \u2013 where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach, preventing your body from absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK a lack of these vitamins in your diet \u2013 this is uncommon, but can occur if you have a vegan diet, follow a fad diet or have a generally poor diet for a long time medication \u2013 certain medications, including anticonvulsants and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can affect how much of these vitamins your body absorbs  Both vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency are more common in older people, affecting around 1 in 10 people aged 75 or over, and 1 in 20 people aged 65 to 74. Read about the causes of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia. Treating vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Most cases of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency can be easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the missing vitamins. Vitamin B12 supplements are usually given by injection at first. Then, depending on whether your B12 deficiency is related to your diet, you'll either require B12 tablets between meals or regular injections. These treatments may be needed for the rest of your life. Folic acid tablets are used to restore folate levels. These usually need to be taken for four months. In some cases, improving your diet can help treat the condition and prevent it recurring. Vitamin B12 is found in meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, yeast extract (such as Marmite) and specially fortified foods. The best sources of folate include green vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts and peas. Read about treating vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Complications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Although it's uncommon, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency (with or without anaemia) can lead to complications, particularly if you've been deficient in vitamin B12 or folate for some time. Potential complications can include: problems with the nervous system temporary infertility heart conditions pregnancy complications and birth defects Adults with severe anaemia are also at risk of developing heart failure. Some complications improve with appropriate treatment, but others \u2013 such as problems with the nervous system \u2013 can be permanent.  Read about the complications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia.

Medications that cause anaesthesia are called anaesthetics. Anaesthetics are used during tests and surgical operations to numb sensation in certain areas of the body or induce sleep. This prevents pain and discomfort, and enables a wide range of medical procedures to be carried out. Local anaesthetics and general anaesthetics are two commonly used types of anaesthetics. A local anaesthetic is often used during minor procedures where a small area of the body is numbed and you remain fully conscious. A general anaesthetic is often used for more serious operations where you're totally unconscious and unaware of the procedure. How anaesthetics work Anaesthetics work by stopping the nerve signals that keep you awake and aware from reaching your brain. During this state of induced sleep, procedures can be carried out without you feeling anything. After the anaesthetic has worn off, the nerve signals will be able to reach your brain, and consciousness and feeling will return. Types of anaesthesia As well as local and general anaesthetic, there are a number of other types of anaesthesia. Unlike general anaesthetic, these don't make you unconscious; they stop you feeling pain in a particular area of your body. The different types of anaesthetic are described below.  regional anaesthetic \u2013 this is a local anaesthetic given to a specific region of your body, giving numbness or pain relief for deeper operations where more extensive numbness is needed epidural anaesthesia \u2013 a type of regional anaesthetic usually used to numb the lower half of the body; for example, as pain relief during labour and childbirth spinal anaesthetic \u2013 a type of regional anaesthetic used to give total numbness lasting about three hours to the lower parts of the body so surgery can be safely carried out in this area sedation \u2013 medication that makes you feel sleepy and relaxes you both physically and mentally; it's sometimes used to keep you calm during minor, painful or unpleasant procedures Different types of anaesthesia can be used in combination. For example, a regional anaesthetic can be used with a general anaesthetic to relieve pain after an operation. A sedative is also sometimes used with a regional anaesthetic to help you feel relaxed and calm during an operation, as well as pain-free.  How anaesthetics are given An anaesthetic can be given in a number of ways: as an ointment, spray or drops as an injection into a vein as a gas you breathe in Anaesthetists Anaesthetists are doctors who have received specialist training in anaesthesia. They'll give you your anaesthetic and be responsible for your safety and wellbeing during your procedure. Before the procedure, your anaesthetist will discuss a number of things with you, including: the types of anaesthetic appropriate for the procedure you're having any risks or side effects associated with different types of anaesthetic They'll plan your anaesthetic and pain control with you, taking into account any preferences you have for a particular type of anaesthetic. You should ask your anaesthetist to clarify anything you're unsure about. Your anaesthetist will carefully monitor you throughout your operation and make sure you wake up comfortably afterwards. They may also help with any pain relief you might need after the procedure. Side effects Anaesthetics consist of a number of medications that can cause side effects in some people. Your anaesthetist will tell you about any side effects you may experience after having a specific type of anaesthetic, and measures that will be taken to reduce these.  Some common side effects that can occur after having a general anaesthetic and some regional anaesthetics include: feeling sick or vomiting dizziness and feeling faint feeling cold or shivering headache itchiness bruising and soreness difficulty passing urine aches and pains The side effects of anaesthetic don't usually last very long and, if necessary, some of them can be treated. Tell the healthcare professionals treating you if you experience any of the above side effects or if you're in pain after your procedure. Risks and complications In recent years, having anaesthesia has become very safe. Advances in equipment, medication and training mean serious problems are rare. However, as with any type of surgery or medical procedure, there's a potential risk of complications. The benefits and risks of surgery and anaesthesia will be carefully weighed up and explained to you before you have any operation. Very rare possible complications include: permanent nerve damage \u2013 this can cause numbness or paralysis (inability to move a part of the body), although this may be a result of the surgery itself; peripheral nerve damage occurs in less than 1 in 1,000 anaesthetics (the peripheral nerves run between the spinal cord and the rest of the body) an allergic reaction to an anaesthetic medication (anaphylaxis) \u2013 although this can be severe, appropriate treatment is on hand to enable the best chance of dealing with this effectively and immediately; it's not clear exactly how often anaesthetics cause anaphylaxis, but the best estimate is that a life-threatening allergic reaction occurs during 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 20,000 anaesthetics death \u2013 there are approximately 10 deaths for every million anaesthetics given in the UK Your risk of developing complications will depend on a number of factors, including:  your medical history \u2013 for example, whether you have any other serious medical conditions or illnesses personal factors \u2013 for example, whether you smoke or are overweight; if you smoke, stopping several weeks before your operation will reduce your risk of having breathing problems, and losing weight will also help reduce your risk the type of procedure \u2013 for example, whether it's a planned or an emergency procedure, or whether it's a major or minor procedure the type of anaesthetic \u2013 local anaesthesia can have advantages over general anaesthetics in the right circumstances Before your procedure, your anaesthetist will explain if there are any particular risks of developing possible complications. In most cases, the benefits outweigh the risks. Any concerns you have should be discussed with your anaesthetist before surgery.

Areas that can be numbed by an epidural include the: chest abdomen pelvic area legs How an epidural works Anaesthetic medicine is injected into an area of the spine known as the epidural space. The anaesthetic works by numbing pain nerves as they enter the spinal cord. The extent of the numbness will depend on the type of drug used, and the amount injected. Once the medication has worn off, feeling in the affected areas will return. Read more about how an epidural is performed. When is an epidural used? An epidural can be used to provide pain relief in situations including: during childbirth during an operation, instead of a general anaesthetic after surgery that has been carried out under general anaesthetic Read more about why an epidural is used. This topic focuses mainly on having an epidural during labour and childbirth. Safety Epidurals have been routinely used for many years and are widely accepted as an effective method of pain relief after surgery, and during labour and childbirth. However, as with many medical procedures, there are some associated risks that, although small, you should be aware of before deciding whether to have an epidural. Two possible risks include: puncture of the dura \u2013 the toughest, outer layer surrounding the spinal cord and brain; the risk of the dura being punctured is about one in 100 nerve damage \u2013 which occurs only very rarely Read more about the side effects and complications of an epidural.

During a general anaesthetic, medications are used to send you to sleep, so you're unaware of surgery and don't move or feel pain while it's carried out. General anaesthesia is essential for some surgical procedures where it may be safer or more comfortable for you to be unconscious. It's usually used for long operations or those that would otherwise be very painful. It's not clear exactly how it works, but it's known that all anaesthetics interrupt the passage of signals along the nerves. This means that any stimulation to the body doesn't get processed or recognised by the brain. How general anaesthetics are given Before having an operation, you'll meet a specialist doctor called an anaesthetist to discuss which anaesthetic is most suitable for you. Your anaesthetist will look at your medical history and will ask whether anyone in your family has had problems with anaesthesia. They'll also ask about your general health and lifestyle, including whether you: have any allergies smoke or drink alcohol are taking any other medication Your anaesthetist can answer any questions you have. Let them know if you're unsure about any part of the procedure or if you have any concerns. You should be given clear instructions to follow before the operation, including whether you can eat or drink anything in the hours leading up to it. Before and during your operation Just before you have surgery, you'll usually be taken to a room where your anaesthetist will give you the general anaesthetic.  It will either be given as a: liquid that's injected into your veins through a cannula (a thin, plastic tube that feeds into a vein, usually on the back of your hand) gas that you breathe in through a mask The anaesthetic should take effect very quickly. You'll start feeling light-headed, before becoming unconscious within a minute or so. Your anaesthetist will stay with you throughout the procedure. They'll make sure you continue to receive the anaesthetic and that you stay in a controlled state of unconsciousness. They'll also give you painkilling medicine into your veins, so that you're comfortable when you wake up. Recovery After your operation, the anaesthetist will stop the anaesthetic and you'll gradually wake up. You'll usually be in a recovery room at first, before being transferred to a ward. Depending on your circumstances, you'll usually need to stay in hospital for a few hours to a few days after your operation. General anaesthetics can affect your memory, concentration and reflexes for a day or two, so it's important for a responsible adult to stay with you for at least 24 hours after your operation, if you're allowed to go home. You'll also be advised to avoid driving, drinking alcohol and signing any legal documents for 24-48 hours. Side effects General anaesthetics have some common side effects. Your anaesthetist should discuss these with you before your surgery. Most side effects occur immediately after your operation and don't last long. Possible side effects include: feeling sick and vomiting \u2013 this usually occurs immediately, although some people may continue to feel sick for up to a day shivering and feeling cold \u2013 this may last a few minutes or hours confusion and memory loss \u2013 this is more common in elderly people or those with existing memory problems; it's usually temporary, but occasionally can be longer lasting bladder problems \u2013 you may have difficulty passing urine dizziness \u2013 you will be given fluids to treat this bruising and soreness \u2013 this may develop in the area where you were injected or had a drip fitted; it usually heals without treatment sore throat \u2013 during your operation, a tube may be inserted either into your mouth or down your throat to help you breathe; afterwards, this can cause a sore throat damage to the mouth or teeth \u2013 a small proportion of people may have small cuts to their lips or tongue from the tube, and some may have damage to their teeth; you should tell your anaesthetist about any dental work you have had done Complications and risks A number of more serious complications are associated with general anaesthetics. These are rare, occurring in less than 1 in every 10,000 cases. Possible serious complications and risks include: a serious allergic reaction to the anaesthetic (anaphylaxis) an inherited reaction to the anaesthetic that causes breathing difficulties waking up during your operation \u2013 but this is rare, and the amount of anaesthetic given will be continuously monitored to help ensure this doesn't happen death \u2013 this is very rare, occurring in 1 in every 100,000 to 1 in every 200,000 cases Serious problems are more likely to occur if you're having major or emergency surgery, you have any other illnesses, you smoke, or you're overweight. Your anaesthetist will discuss the risks with you before your operation. You should try to stop smoking or drinking alcohol in the weeks before surgery, as doing so will reduce your risk of developing complications. You may also be advised to lose weight, and if you can you should increase your activity levels in the weeks before surgery, as this is likely to reduce your risk as well. In most cases, the benefits of being pain-free during an operation outweigh the risks. Other types of anaesthetic As well as general anaesthetic, there are several other types of anaesthetic, which can be used for certain procedures. They include: local anaesthetic epidural anaesthetic spinal anaesthetic nerve blocks  Page last reviewed: 08\/05\/2015 Next review due: 08\/05\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

These medications can be used to treat painful conditions, prevent pain during a procedure or operation, or relieve pain after surgery. Unlike general anaesthetics, local anaesthetics don't cause you to lose consciousness. This means they're generally safer, don't normally require any special preparation before they can be used, and you can recover from them more quickly. How local anaesthetics work Local anaesthetics stop the nerves in a part of your body from sending signals to your brain. You won't be able to feel any pain after having a local anaesthetic, although you may still feel some pressure or movement. It normally only takes a few minutes to lose feeling in the area where a local anaesthetic is given. Full sensation should return a few hours later, when the medication has worn off. How local anaesthetics are used Local anaesthetics are usually given by dentists, surgeons, anaesthetists, GPs and other doctors. Some medications containing mild local anaesthetic are also available on prescription or over the counter from pharmacies. Depending on what they're being used for, local anaesthetics can be given as injections, creams, gels, sprays or ointments. Some of the main uses of local anaesthetics are outlined below. Treating pain Slightly painful conditions such as mouth ulcers and sore throats can sometimes be treated with over-the-counter gels and sprays that contain a local anaesthetic. Injections of a local anaesthetic and steroid medication may be used to treat more severe conditions, such as long-term joint pain.  Preventing pain during and after surgery A local anaesthetic may be used along with a sedative medication to keep you relaxed while an operation or procedure is carried out. Local anaesthetics are mainly used for relatively minor procedures, such as: a filling or wisdom tooth removal a minor skin operation, such as the removal of moles, warts and verrucas some types of eye surgery, such as cataract removal a biopsy \u2013 where a sample of tissue is removed for closer examination under a microscope A local anaesthetic may occasionally be used for more major surgery when it's important for you to be awake, such as during certain types of brain surgery, or to prevent pain after a major operation carried out under a general anaesthetic (see below). Epidural and spinal anaesthetics An epidural anaesthetic, often referred to as an epidural, is where a local anaesthetic is continually injected through a tube into an area of the lower back called the epidural space. A spinal anaesthetic is a single injection into a similar space in the back. Both types of anaesthetic can be used to numb large areas of the body by stopping pain signals travelling along the nerves in the spine. They're often used during childbirth to ease the pain of labour, or if a caesarean section is needed. They can also be used to reduce the amount of general anaesthesia needed during some operations and can provide pain relief afterwards. In some types of surgery, such as knee and hip replacements, they can be used in place of a general anaesthetic. Peripheral nerve blocks A nerve block is an injection of a local anaesthetic to numb the nerves supplying a particular part of the body, such as the hand, arm or leg. It may be used so that an operation can be carried out without needing a general anaesthetic, or to prevent pain afterwards. An ultrasound scan is often used to pinpoint the correct nerve. The injection shouldn't be painful and usually takes about 30 minutes to become fully effective. When peripheral nerve blocks and epidural or spinal anaesthetics are used in place of general anaesthetics, they are often combined with sedation to make you feel drowsy and more relaxed. Risks and side effects Local anaesthetics are generally very safe and serious problems are rare. You may have some discomfort when the injection is given, a tingling sensation as the medication wears off, and possibly some minor bruising, bleeding or soreness where the injection was given, but you shouldn't experience any significant side effects. You should move carefully until the anaesthetic has worn off, as you may not notice if you injured yourself. Some people experience temporary side effects from a local anaesthetic, such as: dizziness headaches blurred vision twitching muscles continuing numbness, weakness or pins and needles These problems will usually pass, but you should tell the healthcare professional in charge of your care if you experience any. In very rare cases, you could have an allergic reaction to the local anaesthetic or develop serious problems such as seizures (fits) or a cardiac arrest (when the heart stops pumping blood around the body).

Less than 1,200 people are diagnosed with cancer of the anus each year in the UK. Symptoms of anal cancer The symptoms of anal cancer are often similar to more common and less serious conditions affecting the anus, such as piles (haemorrhoids) and anal fissures (small tears or sores). Symptoms of anal cancer can include: bleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding) itching and pain around the anus small lumps around the anus a discharge of mucus from the anus loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence) However, some people with anal cancer don't have any symptoms.  See your GP if you develop any of the above symptoms. While they're unlikely to be caused by anal cancer, it's best to get them checked out. Diagnosing anal cancer Your GP will usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations. They may feel your tummy and carry out a rectal examination. This involves your doctor inserting a gloved finger into your bottom so they can feel any abnormalities. Your GP will refer you to hospital if they think further tests are necessary.  The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends in its 2015 guidelines that GPs should consider referring someone with an unexplained anal lump or anal ulcer. The person should receive an appointment within two weeks. If you're referred to hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for anal cancer and rule out other conditions. Some of the tests you may have include a: sigmoidoscopy \u2013 where a thin, flexible tube with a small camera and light is inserted into your bottom to check for any abnormalities proctoscopy \u2013 where the inside of your rectum is examined using a hollow tube-like instrument (proctoscope) with a light on the end biopsy \u2013 where a small tissue sample is removed from your anus during a sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory under a microscope  If these tests suggest you have anal cancer, you may have some scans to check whether the cancer has spread. Once these are complete, your doctors will be able to \"stage\" the cancer. This means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it has spread. You can read more about the stages of anal cancer on the Cancer Research UK website. How anal cancer is treated If you're diagnosed with anal cancer, you'll be cared for by a multidisciplinary team. This is a team of different specialists who work together to provide the best treatment and care. The main treatments used for anal cancer are: chemoradiation \u2013 a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy surgery \u2013 to remove a tumour or a larger section of bowel In cases where the cancer has spread and can't be cured, chemotherapy alone may be considered to help relieve symptoms. This is known as palliative care. The main treatments are described in more detail below. Chemoradiation Chemoradiation is a treatment that combines chemotherapy (cancer-killing medication) and radiotherapy (where radiation is used to kill cancer cells). It's currently the most effective treatment for anal cancer. You don't usually need to stay in hospital when you're having chemoradiation. Chemotherapy for anal cancer is usually given in two cycles, each lasting four to five days, with a four-week gap between the cycles. In many cases, part of the chemotherapy is delivered through a small tube called a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in your arm, which can stay in place until your treatment has finished. The tube means you don't need to stay in hospital during each of the cycles of chemotherapy. However, you'll be attached to a small plastic pump, which you take home with you. A few hospitals now offer tablet chemotherapy for anal cancer, which avoids the need for the pump and PICC. Read more about how chemotherapy is carried out. Radiotherapy is usually given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for five to six weeks. To prepare for radiotherapy, additional scans will be required. Read more about how radiotherapy is carried out. Both chemotherapy and radiotherapy often cause significant side effects, including: tiredness sore skin around the anus sore skin around the penis and scrotum in men or vulva in women hair loss \u2013 limited hair loss from the head, but total loss from the pubic area feeling sick diarrhoea These side effects are usually temporary, but there's also a risk of longer-term problems, such as infertility. If you're concerned about the potential side effects of treatment, you should discuss this with your care team before treatment begins.  Other possible long-term side effects can include: bowel control problems long-term (chronic) diarrhoea erectile dysfunction vaginal pain when having sex dry and itchy skin around the groin and anus bleeding from the anus, rectum, vagina or bladder Tell your doctor if you develop any of these symptoms so they can be investigated and treated. Surgery Surgery is a less common treatment option for anal cancer. It's usually only considered if the tumour is small and can be easily removed, or if chemoradiation hasn't worked. If the tumour is very small and clearly defined, it may be cut out during a procedure called a local excision. This is a relatively simple procedure, carried out under general anaesthetic, that usually only requires a stay in hospital of a few days. If chemoradiation has been unsuccessful or the cancer has returned after treatment, a more complex operation called an abdominoperineal resection may be recommended. As with a local excision, this operation is carried out under general anaesthetic. An abdominoperineal resection involves removing your anus, rectum, part of the colon, some surrounding muscle tissue, and sometimes some of the surrounding lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. You'll usually need to stay in hospital for up to 10 days after this type of surgery. During the operation, a permanent colostomy will also be formed to allow you to pass stools. This is where a section of the large intestine is diverted through an opening made in the abdomen called a stoma. The stoma is attached to a special pouch that will collect your stools after the operation. Before and after the operation, you'll see a specialist nurse who can offer support and advice to help you adapt to life with a colostomy. Adjusting to life with a colostomy can be challenging, but most people become accustomed to it over time. Read more about living with a colostomy. Follow-up After your course of treatment ends, you'll need to have regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning. To start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they'll gradually become less frequent over time. What causes anal cancer? The exact cause of anal cancer is unknown, although a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) \u2013 a common and usually harmless group of viruses spread through sexual contact, which can affect the moist membranes lining your body having anal sex or lots of sexual partners \u2013 possibly because this increases your risk of developing HPV having a history of cervical, vaginal or vulval cancer smoking having a weakened immune system \u2013 for example, if you have HIV Your risk of developing anal cancer increases as you get older, with half of all cases diagnosed in people aged 65 or over. The condition is also slightly more common in women than men. Outlook The outlook for anal cancer depends on how advanced the condition is when it's diagnosed. The earlier it's diagnosed, the better the outlook. Compared with many other types of cancer, the outlook for anal cancer is generally better because treatment is often very effective. Around 66 out of 100 people (66%) with anal cancer will live at least five years after diagnosis, and many will live much longer than this. There are about 300 deaths from anal cancer each year in the UK. Further information about anal cancer Cancer Research UK: anal cancer Macmillan: anal cancer Screening for anal cancer There isn't a screening programme in England for anal cancer. This is because there isn't currently enough evidence to show the benefits of offering screening would outweigh the risks. You can read more about screening for anal cancer on the Cancer Research UK website.

The anal canal is the last part of the large intestine. It's located between the rectum \u2013 where stools are stored \u2013 and the opening in the bottom stools are passed through (anus). Anal fissure symptoms The most common symptoms of anal fissures are: a sharp pain when you pass stools, often followed by a deep burning pain that may last several hours bleeding when you pass stools \u2013 most people notice a small amount of bright red blood either in their stools or on the toilet paper When to see your GP See your GP if you think you have an anal fissure. Don't let embarrassment stop you seeking help: anal fissures are a common problem GPs are used to dealing with. Most anal fissures get better without treatment, but your GP will want to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as piles (haemorrhoids). Your GP can also tell you about self-help measures and treatments that can relieve your symptoms and reduce the risk of fissures recurring. Diagnosing anal fissures Your GP will ask you about your symptoms and the type of pain you've been experiencing. They may also ask about your toilet habits. They'll usually be able to see the fissure by gently parting your buttocks. A digital rectal examination \u2013 where your GP inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into your anus to feel for abnormalities \u2013 isn't usually used to diagnose anal fissures as it's likely to be painful. Your GP may refer you for specialist assessment if they think something serious may be causing your fissure. This may include a more thorough examination of your anus carried out using anaesthetic to minimise pain. Occasionally, a measurement of anal sphincter pressure may be taken for fissures that haven't responded to simple treatments. The anal sphincter is the ring of muscles that open and close the anus. What causes anal fissures? Anal fissures are most commonly caused by damage to the lining of the anus or anal canal. Most cases occur in people who have constipation, when a particularly hard or large stool tears the lining of the anal canal. Other possible causes of anal fissures include: persistent diarrhoea inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis pregnancy and childbirth  occasionally, a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as syphilis or herpes, which can infect and damage the anal canal having unusually tight anal sphincter muscles, which can increase the tension in your anal canal, making it more susceptible to tearing In many cases, no clear cause can be identified. Who's affected? Anal fissures are relatively common, with an estimated 1 in every 10 people affected at some point in their life. Anal fissures affect both sexes equally and occur in people of all ages, including very young children. However, most cases occur in children and young adults between the ages of 10 and 30. Treating and preventing anal fissures Anal fissures usually heal within a few weeks without the need for treatment. However, they can easily recur if they're caused by constipation that remains untreated. In some people, symptoms from anal fissures last six weeks or more (chronic anal fissures). Adopting some simple self-help measures can make passing stools easier. This will allow existing fissures to heal, as well as reduce your chances of developing new fissures in the future. Self-help measures for avoiding constipation include: plenty of fibre in your diet, such as fruit and vegetables and wholemeal bread, pasta and rice \u2013 adults should aim to eat at least 18g of fibre a day staying well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids not ignoring the urge to pass stools \u2013 this can cause your stools to dry out and become harder to pass exercising regularly \u2013 you should aim to do at least 150 minutes of physical activity every week You can help soothe the pain by taking simple painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, or by soaking your bottom in a warm bath several times a day, particularly after a bowel movement. Your GP can also prescribe medication to help relieve your symptoms and speed up the healing process. This can include laxatives to help you pass stools more easily and painkilling ointment that you apply directly to your anus. Surgery may be recommended in persistent cases of anal fissure where self-help measures and medication haven't helped. Surgery is often very effective at treating anal fissures, but it does carry a small risk of complications, such as temporary or permanent loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence).

They're usually the result of an infection near the anus causing a collection of pus (abscess) in the nearby tissue. When the pus drains away, it can leave a small channel behind. Anal fistulas can cause unpleasant symptoms, such as discomfort and skin irritation, and won't usually get better on their own. Surgery is recommended in most cases. This page covers: Symptoms When to get medical advice Causes Treatments Symptoms of an anal fistula Symptoms of an anal fistula can include: skin irritation around the anus a constant, throbbing pain that may be worse when you sit down, move around, have a bowel movement or cough smelly discharge from near your anus  passing pus or blood when you poo swelling and redness around your anus and a high temperature (fever), if you also have an abscess difficulty controlling bowel movements (bowel incontinence) in some cases The end of the fistula might be visible as a hole in the skin near your anus, although this may be difficult for you to see yourself. When to get medical advice See your GP if you have persistent symptoms of an anal fistula. They'll ask about your symptoms and whether you have any bowel conditions. They may also ask to examine your anus and gently insert a finger inside it (rectal examination) to check for signs of a fistula. If your GP thinks you might have a fistula, they can refer you to a specialist called a colorectal surgeon for further tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the most suitable treatment. These may include: a further physical and rectal examination a proctoscopy \u2013 where a special telescope with a light on the end is used to look inside your anus an ultrasound scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, or computerised tomography (CT) scan Causes of anal fistulas Most anal fistulas develop after an anal abscess. They can occur if the abscess doesn't heal properly after the pus has drained away. It's estimated that between one in every two to four people with an anal abscess will develop a fistula. Less common causes of anal fistulas include: Crohn's disease \u2013 a long-term condition in which the digestive system becomes inflamed diverticulitis \u2013 infection of the small pouches that can stick out of the side of the large intestine (colon) hidradenitis suppurativa \u2013 a long-term skin condition that causes abscesses and scarring infection with tuberculosis (TB) or HIV a complication of surgery near the anus Treatments for an anal fistula Anal fistulas usually require surgery as they rarely heal if left untreated. The main options include: a fistulotomy \u2013 a procedure that involves cutting open the whole length of the fistula so it heals into a flat scar seton procedures \u2013 where a piece of surgical thread called a seton is placed in the fistula and left there for several weeks to help it heal before a further procedure is carried out to treat it other techniques \u2013 including filling the fistula with special glue, blocking it with a special plug, or covering it with a flap of tissue All these procedures have different benefits and risks. You can discuss this with your surgeon. Many people don't need to stay in hospital overnight after surgery, although some may need to stay in hospital for a few days.

Causes of itchy bottom As itchy bottom is a symptom rather than a condition itself, many cases have an underlying cause, for example: a bacterial infection \u2013 such as those that cause streptococcal infections a skin condition \u2013 such as atopic eczema, where the skin becomes red, dry and flaky haemorrhoids (piles) \u2013 swellings that contain enlarged and swollen blood vessels in and around the anus In children, an itchy bottom is often caused by threadworms. But not all cases of itchy bottom have an identifiable cause. An itchy bottom can be made worse by: heat woollen clothing or blankets moisture soiling yourself stress or anxiety Read more about the causes of itchy bottom.  When to see your GP See your GP if you've had an itchy bottom for more than a few days, so they can try to find the cause. They may ask about: how often you wash and whether you use creams, powders or soaps around your anus the duration and pattern of your itching \u2013 such as whether your symptoms are worse at night or after eating certain foods other symptoms \u2013 such as bleeding or other discharge from your anus Your GP will usually want to examine the skin around your anus and may ask to carry out a digital rectal examination (DRE) to rule out more serious underlying conditions. You may feel awkward, but it's nothing to be embarrassed or worried about, as this is one of the most common examinations GPs carry out. If necessary, you may be referred to a specialist for further investigation and treatment. Treating itchy bottom An itchy bottom is usually easy to treat at home. Some ways of easing an itchy bottom include: keeping your bottom clean and dry avoid using scented soaps use soft toilet tissue avoid scratching Your GP can prescribe creams or ointments to help relieve your symptoms while the above self-care measures are taking effect. Check with your GP or pharmacist about how long you should use them for. If your itchy bottom is caused by an underlying condition, such as a bacterial infection or piles, it will also need to be treated. Read more about treating an itchy bottom. Complications of itchy bottom Frequently scratching your bottom may damage or tear the delicate skin around your anus. This may lead to problems such as: thick and leathery skin (lichenification) sore and broken down skin (ulceration) the top layer of skin being worn away (excoriation) infection The earlier these complications are diagnosed and treated, the quicker you'll recover. You should visit your GP if the skin around your anus changes or feels painful. If the cause of your itchy bottom can't be identified and treated, it may last for long periods of time (known as chronic itchy bottom). This may cause you to feel embarrassed, anxious or depressed. As the urge to scratch is often worse at night, your sleep may also be disturbed, leaving you feeling tired during the day. Speak to your GP if your itchy bottom is making you anxious or depressed, or if it's significantly affecting your sleep.

The medical name for pain in and around the anus or rectum (back passage) is proctalgia. This pages covers: Common causes of anal pain Less common causes of anal pain When to get medical advice Common causes of anal pain Anal fissures An anal fissure is a small tear in the skin of the anus that can be caused by passing a large or hard poo. Symptoms of an anal fissure can include: a severe, sharp pain when doing a poo a burning or gnawing pain that lasts several hours after doing a poo rectal bleeding \u2013 you may notice a small amount of blood on the toilet paper after you wipe Anal fissures can be very painful, but many heal on their own in a few weeks. Increasing the amount of fibre in your diet, drinking plenty of fluids and taking laxatives and over-the-counter painkillers can help. If the pain persists, you may need special ointment that relaxes the ring of muscle around your anus. Occasionally, surgery may be needed to help the fissure heal. Read more about treatments for anal fissures. Haemorrhoids (piles) Haemorrhoids (piles) are swellings containing enlarged blood vessels that are found inside or around the bottom. They're often thought to be caused by straining on the toilet as a result of prolonged constipation. In many cases, haemorrhoids don't cause symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they may include: bleeding after doing a poo an itchy bottom feeling like there's a lump in or around your anus soreness and redness around your anus anal pain, if the blood supply to the haemorrhoid becomes blocked or interrupted \u2013 for example, by a blood clot The symptoms often pass after a few days. Increasing the amount of fibre in your diet, drinking plenty of fluids and taking laxatives and over-the-counter painkillers can help. If the blood supply to the haemorrhoid has been blocked by a clot, a simple procedure can be carried out to remove the clot under local anaesthetic (where the area is numbed). Read more about treatments for haemorrhoids.  Anal fistulas and abscesses An anal fistula is a small tunnel that develops between the end of the bowel and the skin near the anus. It's usually caused by an infection near the anus resulting in a collection of pus (an abscess). Symptoms of an anal fistula or abscess can include: a constant, throbbing pain that may be worse when you sit down skin irritation around the anus passing pus or blood when you poo swelling and redness around your anus a high temperature (fever) Your GP may prescribe antibiotics if an abscess is picked up early on. If it persists, it may need to be drained in hospital, possibly under general anaesthetic (while you're asleep). If a fistula develops, surgery will usually be needed because they rarely heal by themselves. Read more about treatments for anal fistulas. Less common causes of anal pain Less common causes of anal pain include: proctalgia fugax \u2013 a condition that causes episodes of sudden, severe anal pain that last for a few minutes at a time; medication that relaxes the muscles in the pelvis may help levator ani syndrome \u2013 an aching or pressure sensation in and around the anus that may be constant or last for hours or days at a time; treatment to relax the muscles in the pelvis may help an inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease \u2013 other symptoms can include tummy cramps, bloody diarrhoea and weight loss; treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms an infection \u2013 such as a fungal infection or rectal sexually transmitted infection (STI) a bone-related problem \u2013 such as coccydynia (tailbone pain) or pain that spreads from your lower back, pelvis or hips, caused by arthritis or bone tumours a urinary tract problem \u2013 such as prostatitis (inflammation or infection of the prostate gland) cancer of the anus or lower rectum \u2013 this can have similar symptoms of haemorrhoids and anal fissures, but is much rarer  When to get medical advice Many common causes of anal pain will improve with simple self-care treatments, so you don't always need to see your GP. But it's a good idea to see your GP if: your pain is severe your pain doesn't improve after a few days you also experience rectal bleeding Don't feel embarrassed to see your GP \u2013 anal pain is a common problem that they're used to seeing. Your GP can try to work out what the problem is and give you treatment advice. They'll probably ask to see your bottom and may carry out a rectal examination (where they gently insert a gloved finger into your bottom) to check for any abnormalities. If the cause is not immediately obvious, they may refer you to a specialist for advice and further tests.

It typically results in a rash and joint and tummy pain. HSP can affect people of any age, but the majority of cases occur in children under 10. The medical term for inflammation of the blood vessels is vasculitis. Blood vessels throughout the body become irritated and swollen, which can cause problems such as bleeding into the skin (resulting in a rash) and occasionally problems affecting the kidneys and bowel. HSP is not usually serious and most cases get better within a few weeks. Signs and symptoms The main symptoms of HSP are: a skin rash (purpura) that looks like small bruises or reddish-purple spots, usually on the buttocks, around the elbows and on the legs, and sometimes also on the face and upper body pain in the joints such as the knees and ankles, which can also become swollen, tender and warm tummy pain, which can develop suddenly before the rash appears HSP can also cause some other symptoms, including passing blood in your urine or stools, vomiting and diarrhoea. The condition is often associated with a previous infection (see below), so you or your child may initially have symptoms of an infection as well, such as a high temperature (fever) and feeling generally unwell. Possible complications HSP will usually get better on its own without causing any further problems, but occasionally it can lead to potentially serious complications. The main complications associated with HSP are problems affecting the kidneys, which may not occur until several weeks or months after the other symptoms have passed. This can cause: blood in your urine protein in your urine \u2013 you won't be able to see this yourself, but it can sometimes cause your urine to become \"frothy\" high blood pressure (hypertension) swelling (oedema), particularly around the eyes and ankles These symptoms eventually get better in most people, but in a small proportion the kidneys can stop working properly (kidney failure). HSP can also sometimes cause other problems, such as swelling and pain in the testicles (orchitis) or an abnormal folding in the gut (intussusception) that can lead to a blockage in your bowel. What causes HSP? HSP is caused by a problem with your immune system, possibly as a result of a previous infection. It has been known to occur after a bacterial or viral infection of the throat, airways or lungs (respiratory tract infection). HSP cannot be spread from person to person and doesn't usually run in families. Diagnosing HSP Your GP may suspect HSP based on your symptoms and medical history. To confirm a diagnosis, you may need to be referred to a hospital doctor for the following tests: blood tests \u2013 to see how well the kidneys are working, or to look for recent signs of infection urine dipstick test \u2013 this is used to detect traces of blood or protein in the urine, as these are signs of a problem with the kidneys blood pressure tests \u2013 high blood pressure can also be a sign that the kidneys are affected skin biopsy \u2013 a very small sample of skin is sent to the laboratory to be examined under a microscope (this is only usually done if the doctor is not certain whether it is HSP) If kidney problems are suspected, an ultrasound scan of your tummy and kidneys may also be carried out and you may have a kidney biopsy. This is where a small sample of kidney cells are removed using a needle that is inserted into your lower back. Treating HSP HSP is not usually serious. Most people can be treated at home with only occasional appointments to monitor the condition, although in severe cases admission to hospital may be necessary. The rash, joint pain and tummy pain will usually get better over days or weeks without any treatment. Anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen may help relieve joint pain if needed, but you should check with your doctor before using these as they shouldn't be taken by people with kidney or bowel problems. Paracetamol may be a suitable alternative and resting can also help. A steroid medication such as prednisolone can sometimes help severe tummy pain. Follow-up Due to the risk of kidney problems, you or your child's urine and blood pressure will need to be tested regularly during and after treatment. This may be done during trips to your GP or visits from a community nurse, although you may sometimes be asked to check your child's urine yourself and seek further advice if the results suggest there is a problem.  The exact timing of these tests can vary, but they will usually start off being daily (if testing is done at home) or weekly at first and become less frequent over time. If no problems develop, monitoring can usually stop after around six months. If any problems are detected, you or your child will be referred to a specialist for further tests and any necessary treatment. Testing your or your child's urine If you are asked to check your or your child's urine, you will be given containers to use and a special dipstick that detects small amounts of blood or protein in urine. Your doctor or a nurse will tell you how to use these and how often a urine sample should be tested. You'll need to collect a urine sample first thing in the morning, as this gives the most accurate reading. Your doctor or nurse will talk to you about what the results of the test mean and what you should do if they suggest there is a problem. When to seek medical advice Regardless of your dipstick results, you should contact your GP, nurse or hospital if you or your child: pass red, rusty or blood-coloured urine pass stools with blood in them develop very painful and swollen joints develop severe tummy pain have swollen or painful testicles Outlook HSP usually gets better on its own within about four to six weeks and doesn't generally cause any lasting problems. However, the condition can sometimes be severe and long-lasting \u2013 particularly in adults \u2013 and some people will get it more than once. Kidney problems usually pass without any complications or need for treatment, but in rare cases kidney failure or permanent kidney damage can develop.

It is also known as anaphylactic shock. Signs of anaphylaxis include: itchy skin or a raised, red skin rash swollen eyes, lips, hands and feet feeling lightheaded or faint swelling of the mouth, throat or tongue, which can cause breathing and swallowing difficulties wheezing abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting collapse and unconsciousness What to do Anaphylaxis should always be treated as a medical emergency. If available, an injection of a medicine called adrenaline should be given as soon as possible. Some people with a previous history of anaphylaxis will have an auto-injector of adrenaline. This should be injected into their outer thigh muscle and held in place for 5 to 10 seconds. Instructions for how to use these auto-injectors can be found on the side of each device. You should call 999 for an ambulance whether adrenaline has been given or not. If after 5 to 10 minutes the person still feels unwell, a second injection should be given. This should be given in the opposite thigh. A second dose may also be needed if the person improves and then becomes unwell again. The person should lie flat, with their legs raised on a chair or a low table. If they are having difficulty breathing, they should sit up to make breathing easier. If the person is unconscious, you should move them to the recovery position \u2013 on their side, supported by one leg and one arm, with the head tilted back and the chin lifted. If the person's breathing or heart stops, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be performed. Further treatment will be carried out in hospital. Read more about treating anaphylaxis. Causes and triggers Anaphylaxis is the result of your body's immune system overreacting to a harmless substance, such as food. Substances that trigger allergic reactions are known as allergens. Anaphylaxis usually develops within minutes of contact with an allergen, but sometimes the reaction can happen up to four hours later. The most widely reported triggers of anaphylaxis are: insect stings \u2013 particularly wasp and bee stings peanuts and tree nuts other types of foods \u2013 such as milk and seafood certain medicines \u2013 such as antibiotics Read more about the causes of anaphylaxis. Preventing further episodes If you know what has triggered anaphylaxis, it's important to take steps to avoid exposure to similar triggers. You should be referred to a specialist allergy clinic to either find out your allergy triggers or, if you already know what causes it, for further assessment and advice about how to avoid allergens in the future. You may be given two adrenaline auto-injectors to use during any future episodes of anaphylaxis. Read more about preventing anaphylaxis.  Who is affected? Anaphylaxis is not common, but people of all ages can be affected. People with other allergic conditions, such as asthma or the allergic skin condition atopic eczema, are most at risk of developing anaphylaxis. Although the condition is life threatening, deaths are rare. There are around 20 deaths in the UK each year. With prompt and proper treatment, most people make a full recovery.  Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 04\/12\/2014 Next review due: 04\/12\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

A child born with AIS is genetically male, but the external appearance of their genitals may be female or somewhere between male and female. Someone with AIS may benefit from psychological support, and in some cases may have treatment to alter the appearance of their genitals. Most people born with the condition are unable to have children, but they'll otherwise be perfectly healthy and able to lead a normal life. What causes AIS? AIS is caused by a genetic fault that's usually passed on to a child by their mother. This genetic fault means that, despite being genetically male, the body doesn't respond to testosterone (the male sex hormone) properly and male sexual development doesn't happen as normal. This means the penis doesn't form or is underdeveloped. The child's genitals may appear female, or between male and female, but they don't have a womb or ovaries and have fully or partially undescended testicles. Women who carry the genetic fault won't have AIS themselves, but there's a one in four chance each child they have will be born with the condition. Read more about the causes of AIS. Types of AIS There are two main types of AIS, which are determined by how much the body is able to use testosterone. These are: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) \u2013 where testosterone has no effect on sexual development, so the genitals are entirely female partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) \u2013 where testosterone still has some effect on sexual development, so the genitals are often between male and female PAIS is usually noticed at birth because the genitals appear different. CAIS can be more difficult to spot, as the genitals usually look normal for a girl. It's often not diagnosed until puberty, when periods don't start and pubic and underarm hair doesn't develop. Read more about the symptoms of AIS and diagnosing AIS. Living with AIS Children with AIS and their parents are supported by a team of specialists, who will offer ongoing care and support. They will help you decide whether to raise your child as a girl or a boy while they're still very young. Most children with CAIS are raised as girls, while those with PAIS can be brought up either as girls or boys. It's up to you as a parent, with help from specialists, to decide what you think is in the best interests of your child. Once you've decided, you can learn about the treatments available that can help make your child's body look more consistent with the chosen gender and help them develop more naturally. This may involve surgery to alter the appearance or function of their genitals, and hormone treatment to encourage female or male development during puberty. Read more about how AIS is treated. Support and advice You and your child will be offered psychological support to help you understand and cope with the diagnosis of AIS. Children may not need this while they're very young, but they usually do as they get older. You'll be given advice about how and when to discuss the condition with your child. You may also find it helpful to get in touch with a support group, such as the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (AISSG) and DSD Families. Information about your child If your child has AIS, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Gender identity and gender dysphoria Most children with AIS grow up to feel they are the gender their parents chose to raise them as. This feeling is known as their gender identity. In a few cases, older children and adults with AIS feel their gender identity doesn't match the gender they've been raised as. This is known as gender dysphoria. People with gender dysphoria often have a desire to live as a member of the opposite sex, and may want treatment to make their physical appearance more consistent with their gender identity. If your child is diagnosed with AIS, you should be told about the issues of gender identity that could arise as your child gets older.

The abdominal aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body and is usually around 2cm wide \u2013 roughly the width of a garden hose. However, it can swell to over 5.5cm \u2013 what doctors class as a large AAA. Large aneurysms are rare, but can be very serious. If a large aneurysm bursts, it causes huge internal bleeding and is usually fatal. The bulging occurs when the wall of the aorta weakens. Although what causes this weakness is unclear, smoking and high blood pressure are thought to increase the risk of an aneurysm. AAAs are most common in men aged over 65. A rupture accounts for more than 1 in 50 of all deaths in this group and a total of 6,000 deaths in England and Wales each year. This is why all men are invited for a screening test when they turn 65. The test involves a simple ultrasound scan, which takes around 10-15 minutes. Symptoms of an AAA In most cases, an AAA causes no noticeable symptoms. However, if it becomes large, some people may develop a pain or a pulsating feeling in their abdomen (tummy) or persistent back pain. An AAA doesn\u2019t usually pose a serious threat to health, but there\u2019s a risk that a larger aneurysm could burst (rupture). A ruptured aneurysm can cause massive internal bleeding, which is usually fatal. Around 8 out of 10 people with a rupture either die before they reach hospital or don\u2019t survive surgery. The most common symptom of a ruptured aortic aneurysm is sudden and severe pain in the abdomen. If you suspect that you or someone else has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Read more about the symptoms of an AAA. Causes of an AAA It's not known exactly what causes the aortic wall to weaken, although increasing age and being male are known to be the biggest risk factors. There are other risk factors you can do something about, including smoking and having high blood pressure and cholesterol level. Having a family history of aortic aneurysms also means that you have an increased risk of developing one yourself. Read more about the causes of an AAA. Diagnosing an AAA Because AAAs usually cause no symptoms, they tend to be diagnosed either as a result of screening or during a routine examination \u2013 for example, if a GP notices a pulsating sensation in your abdomen. The screening test is an ultrasound scan, which allows the size of your abdominal aorta to be measured on a monitor. This is also how an aneurysm will be diagnosed if your doctor suspects you have one. Read more about diagnosing an AAA. Treating an AAA If a large AAA is detected before it ruptures, most people will be advised to have treatment, to prevent it rupturing. This is usually done with surgery to replace the weakened section of the blood vessel with a piece of synthetic tubing. If surgery is not advisable \u2013 or if you decide not to have it \u2013 there are a number of non-surgical treatments that can reduce the risk of an aneurysm rupturing. They include medications to lower your cholesterol and blood pressure, and quitting smoking. You will also have the size of your aneurysm checked regularly with ultrasound scanning. Read more about treating AAAs. Prevention The best way to prevent getting an aneurysm \u2013 or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing \u2013 is to avoid anything that could damage your blood vessels, such as: smoking eating a high-fat diet not exercising regularly being overweight or obese Read more about preventing aneurysms. Screening Men who are 65 and over are offered a screening test to check if they have an AAA. All men in England are invited for screening in the year they turn 65. Men who are over 65 and have not previously been screened can request a screening test by contacting their local AAA screening service directly. Women and men under 65 are not invited for screening. However, if you feel you have an increased risk of having an AAA, talk to your GP who can still refer you for a scan. Read more about screening for an AAA.

An aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall. As blood passes through the weakened blood vessel, the blood pressure causes it to bulge outwards. Exactly what causes the blood vessel wall to weaken is unclear, though hardening of the arteries, smoking and high blood pressure are thought to increase the risk of an aneurysm. Aneurysms can occur anywhere in the body, but the two most common places for them to form are in the abdominal aorta and the brain. A burst abdominal aortic aneurysm is also a medical emergency and is usually fatal.

Aneurysms can develop in any blood vessel in the body, but the two most common places are: the abdominal aorta \u2013 the artery that transports blood away from the heart to the rest of the body the brain This topic is about brain aneurysms. There's a separate topic about abdominal aortic aneurysm. About brain aneurysms The medical term for an aneurysm that develops inside the brain is an intracranial or cerebral aneurysm. Most brain aneurysms only cause noticeable symptoms if they burst (rupture). This leads to an extremely serious condition known as a subarachnoid haemorrhage, where bleeding caused by the ruptured aneurysm can cause extensive brain damage and symptoms such as: a sudden agonising headache \u2013 it's been described as a \"thunderclap headache\", similar to a sudden hit on the head, resulting in a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before stiff neck sickness and vomiting pain on looking at light About three in five people who have a subarachnoid haemorrhage die within two weeks. Half of those who survive are left with severe brain damage and disability. Read more about the symptoms of a brain aneurysm. A ruptured brain aneurysm is a medical emergency. If you suspect someone has had a brain haemorrhage, which could be caused by a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. How brain aneurysms are treated If a brain aneurysm is detected before it ruptures, treatment may be recommended to prevent it rupturing in future. Most aneurysms won't rupture, so treatment is only carried out if the risk of a rupture is particularly high. Factors that affect whether treatment is recommended include your age, the size and position of the aneurysm, your family medical history, and any other health conditions you have. If treatment is recommended, this usually involves either filling the aneurysm with tiny metal coils or an open operation to seal it shut with a tiny metal clip. If your risk of a rupture is low, you'll have regular check-ups to monitor your aneurysm. You may also be given medication to reduce your blood pressure and advice about ways you can reduce your chances of a rupture, such as stopping smoking if you smoke. The same techniques used to prevent ruptures are also used to treat brain aneurysms that have already ruptured. Read more about diagnosing brain aneurysms and treating brain aneurysms. Why brain aneurysms develop Exactly what causes the wall of affected blood vessels to weaken is still unclear, although risk factors have been identified, including:  smoking high blood pressure a family history of brain aneurysms In some cases, an aneurysm may develop because there was a weakness in the walls of the blood vessels at birth. Read more about the causes of brain aneurysms. Who is affected? It's difficult to estimate exactly how many people are affected by brain aneurysms because they usually cause no symptoms and pass undetected. Some experts believe it could be as high as 1 in 20 people, while others think the figure is much lower at around 1 in 100 people. The number of aneurysms that actually rupture is much smaller. Only around 1 in 12,500 people have a ruptured brain aneurysm in England each year. Brain aneurysms can develop in anyone at any age, but are more common in people over the age of 40. Women tend to be affected more commonly than men.

It's relatively rare, occurring in around 1 in 16,000 people. Typical characteristics of Angelman syndrome include: delayed development (usually noticeable from 6-12 months of age) severe language impairment with little or no speech movement and balance problems (ataxia) frequent seizures (epilepsy) in around 85% of cases  a small head size (microcephaly) sociable behaviour with frequent smiling In most cases, Angelman syndrome isn't inherited from your parents, and the genetic anomaly responsible for the syndrome occurs by chance around the time of conception. However, in some families, more than one child is affected (see below). Characteristics of Angelman syndrome The typical characteristics of Angelman syndrome aren't usually apparent at birth. A child with the syndrome will begin to show signs of delayed development around 6-12 months, such as being unable to sit unsupported or make babbling noises. Later, they may not speak at all or may only be able to say a few words. The movement of a child with Angelman syndrome will also be affected. They may have difficulty walking due to problems with balance and co-ordination (ataxia), their arms may tremble or move jerkily, and their legs may be stiffer than normal. A number of distinctive behaviours are also associated with Angelman syndrome. These may include: frequent laughter and smiling, with little stimulus being easily excitable, often flapping the hands being restless (hyperactive) having a short attention span problems sleeping and needing less sleep than other children   By around two years of age, an abnormally small head which is flat at the back (microbrachycephaly) will often be noticeable in children with Angelman syndrome. They may also start to have seizures (fits) around this age. Other possible features of the syndrome include: sticking the tongue out crossed eyes (strabismus) pale skin, and light-coloured hair and eyes a wide mouth with widely spaced teeth a side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis) walking with arms in the air a fascination with water Some young babies with Angelman syndrome may have problems feeding because they're unable to co-ordinate sucking and swallowing. In such cases, a high-calorie formula may be recommended to help the baby gain weight, or they may need to be treated for reflux. What causes Angelman syndrome? The typical characteristics of Angelman syndrome are caused when a gene, known as UBE3A, is either absent or malfunctions. A gene is a single unit of DNA. A child usually inherits one copy of the UBE3A gene from each parent. Both copies are switched on (active) in most of the body's tissues. However, in certain areas of the brain, only the gene inherited from the mother is active. In most cases of Angelman syndrome (about 70%), the child's maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is missing, which means there's no active copy of the UBE3A gene in the child's brain. In around 11% of cases, the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is altered (mutated).  In a small number of cases, Angelman syndrome occurs when a child inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from the father, rather than inheriting one from each parent. It can also occur when the copy of the UBE3A gene that comes from the mother, behaves like it came from the father. This is known as an \"imprinting defect\". In about 10-15% of cases, the cause of Angelman syndrome is unknown. It's thought that most children in these unexplained cases may have different conditions involving other genes or chromosomes. Diagnosing Angelman syndrome Angelman syndrome may be suspected if a child's development is delayed and they have the syndrome's distinctive characteristics (see above). A blood sample can be taken to confirm the diagnosis. A number of genetic tests will be carried out on the sample. These may include: chromosome analysis - to see if any parts of the chromosomes are missing  fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) - used to check chromosome 15 deletions  DNA methylation - shows whether the genetic material on both the mother\u2019s and father\u2019s chromosomes is active; it can detect deletions, uniparental disomy and imprinting defects UBE3A gene mutation analysis - if the results of DNA methylation are normal, UBE3A gene sequencing can be used to see whether the maternal copy of the gene is altered For each child with Angelman syndrome, it's important to know the genetic change that caused the condition to determine the risk of it occurring again in another child.   Most children with Angelman syndrome are diagnosed between the ages of 18 months and 6 years, when the typical physical and behavioural symptoms become apparent. If your child is diagnosed with Angelman syndrome, you should be given the opportunity to discuss the genetic diagnosis and implications with a genetic doctor. Managing Angelman syndrome Some of the symptoms of Angleman syndrome can be difficult to manage, and you're likely to need help from a wide range of different healthcare professionals. Your child may benefit from some of the following treatments and aids: anti-epileptic medicine to control the seizures (sodium valproate, clonazepam or ethosuximide may be prescribed) physiotherapy may help to improve posture, balance and walking ability; it's also important to prevent permanent stiffening (contractures) of the joints as they get older a back brace or spinal surgery may be recommended to prevent the spine from becoming more curved (see treating scoliosis) an ankle or foot orthosis (lower leg brace) may be recommended to help them walk independently communication therapy may be needed to help them develop non-verbal language skills, such as sign language and using visual aids; using iPad applications and similar devices may also help behavioural therapy may be recommended to help overcome problem behaviours, hyperactivity and a short attention span activities such as swimming, horseriding and music therapy have also been reported as being beneficial Read more about caring for a disabled child. Outlook While there's currently no cure for Angelman syndrome, the results of preliminary genetic research carried out in America have been promising. Following these studies, scientists believe that it may be possible to restore UBE3A function in the brains of people with Angelman syndrome. With age, people with Angelman syndrome become less hyperactive and the sleeping problems tend to improve. Most people with the syndrome will have intellectual disability and limited speech throughout their life. In later childhood, the seizures usually improve, although they may return in adulthood. In adults, some mobility may be lost and joints may stiffen up. A person with Angelman syndrome will have a near-normal life expectancy, but will need looking after for the rest of their life. As a parent carer, it's important that you look after your own health and wellbeing too. Read more about carers' wellbeing. Information about your child If your child has Angelman syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Children with Angelman syndrome are often very sociable and frequently smile  Help and support The Angelman Syndrome Support Education and Research Trust (ASSERT) is a UK based charity providing information and support for parents and carers of people with the syndrome. As well as visiting the website, you can also call the charity's helpline - 0300 999 0102 - to speak with parents of people with Angelman syndrome, who can offer you help and advice.  Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 02\/09\/2014 Next review due: 02\/09\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

However, it can be a problem if you find it difficult to keep it under control. \"You can control your anger, and you have a responsibility to do so,\" says clinical psychologist Isabel Clarke, a specialist in anger management. Dealing with anger Managing anger in the long term Let go of angry thoughts Anxiety, fear and anger Domestic violence and anger Getting help with anger Dealing with anger \"Everyone has a physical reaction to anger. Be aware of what your body is telling you, and take steps to calm yourself down,\" says Isabel. Recognise your anger signs Your heart beats faster and you breathe more quickly, preparing you for action. You might also notice other signs, such as tension in your shoulders or clenching your fists. \"If you notice these signs, get out of the situation if you\u2019ve got a history of losing control,\" says Isabel. Count to 10 Counting to 10 gives you time to cool down, so you can think more clearly and overcome the impulse to lash out. Breathe slowly Breathe out for longer than you breathe in, and relax as you breathe out. \"You automatically breathe in more than out when you\u2019re feeling angry, and the trick is to breathe out more than in,\" says Isabel. \"This will calm you down effectively and help you think more clearly.\" Managing anger in the long term Once you can recognise that you\u2019re getting angry, and can calm yourself down, you can start looking at ways to control your anger more generally.  Exercise can help with anger Bring down your general stress levels with exercise and relaxation. Running, walking, swimming, yoga and meditation are just a few activities that can reduce stress. \"Exercise as part of your daily life is a good way to get rid of irritation and anger,\" says Isabel. Looking after yourself may keep you calm Make time to relax regularly, and ensure that you get enough sleep. Drugs and alcohol can make anger problems worse. \"They lower inhibitions and, actually, we need inhibitions to stop us acting unacceptably when we\u2019re angry,\" says Isabel. Get creative Writing, making music, dancing or painting can release tension and reduce feelings of anger. Talk about how you feel Discussing your feelings with a friend can be useful and can help you get a different perspective on the situation. Let go of angry thoughts \"Try to let go of any unhelpful ways of thinking,\" says Isabel. \"Thoughts such as 'It\u2019s not fair,' or 'People like that shouldn\u2019t be on the roads,' can make anger worse.\" Thinking like this will keep you focused on whatever it is that\u2019s making you angry. Let these thoughts go and it will be easier to calm down. Try to avoid using phrases that include: always (for example, \"You always do that.\") never (\"You never listen to me.\") should or shouldn't (\"You should do what I want,\" or \"You shouldn't be on the roads.\") must or mustn't (\"I must be on time,\" or \"I mustn't be late.\") ought or oughtn't (\"People ought to get out of my way.\") not fair Anxiety, fear and anger Sometimes when people talk about \"anger\" what they actually mean is aggression, says Dr James Woollard, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist. \"Often when people experience or appear to show anger, it\u2019s because they are also feeling fear or perceive a threat, and they are responding with a 'fight' response to this.\" \"Asking yourself, 'What might I be scared of?' can give you a different set of choices about how to respond,\" says Dr Woollard. \"You might be angry that something has not gone your way. But you may also be scared that you might be blamed or hurt as result. Recognising this might allow you to think and act differently.\" Read more on how to manage your anxiety. \"Managing your anger is as much about managing your happiness and contentment as your anger,\" adds Dr Woollard. \"It should be a part of developing your emotional intelligence and resilience.\" Domestic violence and anger If uncontrolled anger leads to domestic violence (violence or threatening behaviour within the home), there are places that offer help and support. You can talk to your GP or contact domestic violence organisations such as Refuge, Women's Aid or the Alternatives to Violence Project. Read about getting help for domestic abuse. Getting help with anger If you feel you need help dealing with your anger, see your GP. There might be local anger management courses or counselling that could help you. There are private courses and therapists who can help with anger issues. Make sure any therapist you see is registered with a professional organisation, such as the British Association for Counselling & Psychotherapy. Anger management programmes A typical anger management programme may involve one-to-one counselling and working in a small group. The programmes can consist of a one-day or weekend course. In some cases, it may be over a couple of months. The structure of the programmes can differ, depending on who is providing it, but most programmes include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), as well as counselling.

Try to avoid using phrases that include: always (for example, \"You always do that.\") never (\"You never listen to me.\") should or shouldn't (\"You should do what I want,\" or \"You shouldn't be on the roads.\") must or mustn't (\"I must be on time,\" or \"I mustn't be late.\") ought or oughtn't (\"People ought to get out of my way.\") not fair Anxiety, fear and anger Sometimes when people talk about \"anger\" what they actually mean is aggression, says Dr James Woollard, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist. \"Often when people experience or appear to show anger, it\u2019s because they are also feeling fear or perceive a threat, and they are responding with a 'fight' response to this.\" \"Asking yourself, 'What might I be scared of?' can give you a different set of choices about how to respond,\" says Dr Woollard. \"You might be angry that something has not gone your way. But you may also be scared that you might be blamed or hurt as result. Recognising this might allow you to think and act differently.\" Read more on how to manage your anxiety. \"Managing your anger is as much about managing your happiness and contentment as your anger,\" adds Dr Woollard. \"It should be a part of developing your emotional intelligence and resilience.\" Domestic violence and anger If uncontrolled anger leads to domestic violence (violence or threatening behaviour within the home), there are places that offer help and support. You can talk to your GP or contact domestic violence organisations such as Refuge, Women's Aid or the Alternatives to Violence Project. Read about getting help for domestic abuse. Getting help with anger If you feel you need help dealing with your anger, see your GP. There might be local anger management courses or counselling that could help you. There are private courses and therapists who can help with anger issues. Make sure any therapist you see is registered with a professional organisation, such as the British Association for Counselling & Psychotherapy. Anger management programmes A typical anger management programme may involve one-to-one counselling and working in a small group. The programmes can consist of a one-day or weekend course. In some cases, it may be over a couple of months. The structure of the programmes can differ, depending on who is providing it, but most programmes include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), as well as counselling.

It usually happens because the arteries supplying the heart become hardened and narrowed. The pain and discomfort of angina feels like a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest that can sometimes spread to the left arm, neck, jaw or back. The pain is usually triggered by physical activity or stress and typically only lasts for a few minutes. This is often referred to as an angina attack. Read more about the symptoms of angina. When to seek medical help Dial 999 to request an ambulance if you experience chest pain and you haven't previously been diagnosed with a heart problem. If you have an angina attack and you've previously been diagnosed with the condition, take the medication prescribed for you (glyceryl trinitrate). A second dose can be taken after five minutes if the first dose doesn't have any effect. If there's no improvement five minutes after the second dose, call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Types of angina The two main types of angina are stable angina and unstable angina. stable angina \u2013 where angina attacks are brought on by an obvious trigger (such as exercise) and improve with medication and rest unstable angina \u2013 where angina attacks are more unpredictable, occurring with no obvious trigger and continuing despite resting Stable angina isn't life-threatening on its own. However, it's a serious warning sign that you're at increased risk of developing a life-threatening heart attack or stroke. Some people develop unstable angina after previously having stable angina, while others experience unstable angina with no history of having angina before. Unstable angina should be regarded as a medical emergency, because it's a sign that the function of your heart has suddenly and rapidly deteriorated, increasing your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. Read more about diagnosing angina. Why angina happens Most cases of angina are caused by atherosclerosis, which is the hardening and narrowing of arteries as a result of a build-up of fatty substances known as plaques. This can restrict the blood supply to the heart and trigger the symptoms of angina. Advanced age, smoking, obesity and eating a diet high in saturated fats all increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis. Read more about the causes of angina. Treating angina Treatment for angina aims to relieve the symptoms during an angina attack, reduce the number of angina attacks that a person has, and reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke happening. A number of medications can be used to try to achieve this. Some of these are only taken when needed, while others are taken every day. Surgery to widen or bypass the narrowed arteries may be recommended if the symptoms don't respond to medication. Read more about treating angina. Complications A major concern for people with angina is that their atherosclerosis will continue to get worse. This can lead to the blood supply to their heart becoming blocked, which could trigger a heart attack. Similarly, a blockage of the blood supply to the brain could trigger a stroke. Each year it's estimated that 1 in every 100 people with stable angina will have a fatal heart attack or stroke, and as many as 1 in 40 people will have a non-fatal heart attack or stroke. You can considerably reduce your risk of developing these complications by making lifestyle changes. For example, if you're obese and you smoke, you can significantly reduce your risk by stopping smoking and maintaining a healthy weight. Read more about the complications of angina and preventing angina. Who's affected by angina Angina is a common condition among older adults. In England, it's estimated that 1 in every 12 men and 1 in every 30 women between 55 and 64 years of age have angina. This figure rises to 1 in every 7 men and 1 in every 12 women who are over 65 years of age. Angina is more common in men than women.  Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 29\/04\/2015 Next review due: 29\/04\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The symptoms of angioedema can affect any part of the body, but swelling usually affects the: eyes lips genitals hands feet Many people with angioedema also experience urticaria (hives). This is a raised, red and itchy rash that appears on the skin. Read more about the symptoms of angioedema. Why does angioedema happen? The cause of angioedema depends on the type you have. There are four main types of angioedema: allergic angioedema \u2013 the swelling is caused by an allergic reaction, such as a reaction to peanuts, and sometimes occurs in combination with anaphylaxis idiopathic angioedema \u2013 there is no known cause for the swelling (although certain factors, such as stress or infection, may trigger the symptoms) drug-induced angioedema \u2013 the swelling is a side effect of certain medications, most often angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors hereditary angioedema \u2013 the swelling is caused by \"faulty\" genes that are inherited from a person\u2019s parents Read more about the causes of angioedema. Who is affected Angioedema is a common condition, affecting about 10-20% of people during their life, although some types are more common than others. Hereditary angioedema is rare, only affecting between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 50,000 people worldwide. Diagnosis Your doctor can diagnose angioedema by examining the affected skin and discussing symptoms. However, further tests, such as blood tests or allergy tests, may be required to determine the type of angioedema. Idiopathic angioedema is only diagnosed if no cause can be found. Read more about diagnosing angioedema. How is angioedema treated? Although most cases of angioedema get better without treatment after a few days, medication is often used. For cases of allergic and idiopathic angioedema, antihistamines and oral steroids (steroid tablets) can be used to relieve the swelling. Drug-induced angioedema can usually be treated by using an alternative medication to treat whatever underlying condition you have. Although the condition cannot be cured, regular drug treatment can prevent attacks in people with hereditary angioedema. Read more about treating angioedema. Swollen lips are a common sign of angioedema  Anaphylaxis Angioedema can sometimes occur in combination with anaphylaxis \u2013 a severe, potentially life-threatening, allergic reaction. Signs of anaphylaxis include: narrowing of the airways, which can cause wheezing and breathing difficulties feeling dizzy or fainting Anaphylaxis should always be treated as a medical emergency.

The images created during an angiography are called angiograms. Blood vessels don't show up clearly on ordinary X-rays, so a substance called contrast medium is injected into the area being examined. This highlights the blood vessels as it moves through them. The medical name for this type of angiography is catheterisation. Less commonly, angiographies can also be carried out non-invasively using computerised tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the technique used will depend on a number of factors. Why angiograms are used The heart is one of the most common areas of the body that needs to be checked using angiography. During coronary angiography, the flow of blood to the heart muscle can be assessed. The procedure can also be used to help diagnose coronary heart disease. Other conditions that affect blood vessels and the flow of blood through them can also be detected using angiography \u2013 for example, aneurysm (where a section of a blood vessel wall bulges due to a weakness in the wall). Serious arterial disease in the body can cause problems such as strokes, heart attacks, gangrene and organ failure, so for certain people it's important that circulation problems are investigated. The images from coronary angiography can be used to help plan treatment for angina and heart attacks. Treatment options include medication or surgery, such as a coronary angioplasty or a coronary artery bypass graft. Other areas of the body that can be examined using angiography include the: brain (cerebral angiography) lungs (pulmonary angiography) kidneys (renal angiography) arms or legs (extremity angiography) Read more about what angiography is used for.  The angiography procedure Angiography is carried out in hospital. It takes between 30 minutes and two hours, depending on the complexity of the investigation. You'll usually be allowed to go home on the same day, although in some cases you may need to stay in hospital overnight. Most angiographies are planned procedures carried out under local anaesthetic, sometimes with sedation. However, general anaesthetic may be used for young children or if the procedure is particularly complex. A very thin flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into one of your arteries through a small cut. The artery is usually in your groin or wrist. A radiologist (doctor who specialises in imaging studies) or cardiologist (heart specialist) will guide the catheter into the area that needs to be examined. The contrast medium will be injected through the catheter and into the blood vessel. A series of X-ray images will be taken. Read more about what happens during an angiography. Safety Generally, angiography is a safe and painless procedure and the risk of serious complications is low. There can sometimes be minor bruising where the catheter is inserted. Some people may occasionally have an allergic reaction to the contrast dye, although this can usually be easily treated with medication. Read more about the complications of an angiography.

The term 'angioplasty' means using a balloon to stretch open a narrowed or blocked artery. However, most modern angioplasty procedures also involve inserting a short wire-mesh tube, called a stent, into the artery during the procedure. The stent is left in place permanently to allow blood to flow more freely. Coronary angioplasty is sometimes known as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The combination of coronary angioplasty with stenting is usually referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). When a coronary angioplasty is used Like all organs in the body, the heart needs a constant supply of blood. This is supplied by the coronary arteries. In older people, these arteries can become narrowed and hardened (known as atherosclerosis), which can cause coronary heart disease. If the flow of blood to the heart becomes restricted, it can lead to chest pain known as angina, which is usually triggered by physical activity or stress. While angina can often be treated with medication, a coronary angioplasty may be required to restore the blood supply to the heart in severe cases where medication is ineffective. Coronary angioplasties are also often used as an emergency treatment after a heart attack. What are the benefits of a coronary angioplasty? In most cases, the blood flow through the coronary arteries improves after an angioplasty. Many people find their symptoms get significantly better and they\u2019re able to do more than they could before the procedure. If you've had a heart attack, an angioplasty can increase your chances of surviving more than clot-busting medication (thrombolysis). The procedure can also reduce your chances of having another heart attack in the future. How a coronary angioplasty is performed A coronary angioplasty is performed using local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake while the procedure is carried out. A thin flexible tube called a catheter will be inserted into one of your arteries through an incision in your groin, wrist or arm. This is guided to the affected coronary artery using an X-ray video. When the catheter is in place, a thin wire is guided down the length of the affected coronary artery, delivering a small balloon to the affected section of artery. This is then inflated to widen the artery, squashing fatty deposits against the artery wall so blood can flow through it more freely when the deflated balloon is removed. If a stent is being used, this will be around the balloon before it's inserted. The stent will expand when the balloon is inflated and remains in place when the balloon is deflated and removed. A coronary angioplasty usually takes between 30 minutes and two hours. If you're being treated for angina, you'll normally be able to go home later the same day or the day after you have the procedure. You'll need to avoid heavy lifting, strenuous activities and driving for at least a week. If you've been admitted to hospital following a heart attack, you may need to stay in hospital for several days after the angioplasty procedure before going home. Read more about:  what happens during a coronary angioplasty  recovering from a coronary angioplasty How safe is a coronary angioplasty? A coronary angioplasty is one of the most common types of treatment for the heart. Around 75,000 procedures are performed in England each year. Coronary angioplasties are most commonly performed in people aged 65 or older, as they're more likely to have heart disease. As the procedure doesn't involve making major incisions in the body, it's usually carried out safely in most people. Doctors refer to this as a minimally invasive form of treatment. The risk of serious complications from a coronary angioplasty is generally small, but this depends on factors such as: your age your general health whether you've had a heart attack Serious problems that can occur as a result of the procedure include excessive bleeding, a heart attack and a stroke. Read more about the possible complications of a coronary angioplasty. Are there any alternatives? If many coronary arteries have become blocked and narrowed, or the structure of your arteries is abnormal, a coronary artery bypass graft may be considered. This is a type of invasive surgery where sections of healthy blood vessel are taken from other parts of the body and attached to the coronary arteries. Blood is diverted through these vessels, so it bypasses the narrowed or clogged parts of the arteries.

Always seek medical advice if you've been bitten by an animal or person and the bite has broken the skin. People and animals have a lot of bacteria in their mouths, which can cause an infection if a bite breaks the skin. These infections are rarely serious if treated quickly, but occasionally they can spread to the blood or other parts of the body. Serious infections such as tetanus and rabies are extremely rare in the UK, but it's important to get serious bites looked at as treatment to prevent these infections may be recommended. The following information is about bites by people and animals such as dogs and cats. There are separate pages on insect bites and snake bites. This page covers: What to do if you've been bitten When to get medical advice Signs that a bite may be infected Common causes of bites How to avoid animal bites What to do if you've been bitten If you've been bitten by an animal or another person: clean the wound immediately by running warm tap water over it for a couple of minutes \u2013 it's a good idea to do this even if the skin doesn't appear to be broken remove any objects from the bite, such as teeth, hair or dirt encourage the wound to bleed slightly by gently squeezing it, unless it's already bleeding freely if the wound is bleeding heavily, put a clean pad or sterile dressing over it and apply pressure dry the wound and cover it with a clean dressing or plaster take painkillers if you're in pain, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen \u2013 children under 16 years old shouldn't take aspirin seek medical advice, unless the wound is very minor If the bite has severed a body part like a finger or ear, wash it with tap water, wrap it in clean tissue, and store it in a plastic bag surrounded by ice so it can be transported to hospital. It may be possible to surgically reattach the body part later on. When to seek medical advice If the bite has broken the skin, you should seek immediate medical attention after cleaning the wound. Don't delay seeking help until symptoms of infection appear. Minor bites can be treated at your GP surgery, or by staff at your local walk-in centre or minor injuries unit. For particularly severe bites, visit your local accident and emergency (A&E) department. The healthcare professional treating you may: clean the wound and remove any damaged tissue prescribe a course of antibiotics to prevent infection recommend specific treatment to prevent infections such as tetanus if you're felt to be at risk close the wound with stitches if the risk of infection is thought to be low \u2013 high-risk wounds will usually be left open as this means they're easier to keep clean arrange blood tests to check for infection, or an X-ray to check for any damage to your bones and see if there's anything embedded in your wound, such as a tooth refer you for an assessment by a specialist if the bite penetrated a joint, or there's severe damage, such as damage to bones or nerves \u2013 surgery may be needed in these cases if you're bitten by a person with hepatitis or HIV, there's a tiny chance of the infection spreading if the bite is contaminated with blood, so you may be offered treatment to stop you becoming infected When you return home, watch out for signs of a possible infection. Signs a bite may be infected Symptoms that suggest a wound has become infected include: redness and swelling around the wound the wound feels warm and increasingly painful liquid or pus leaks from the wound a fever of 38C (100.4F) or above sweats and chills swollen glands under the chin or in the neck, armpits or groin red streaks extending along the skin from the wound Get medical help as soon as possible if you think your wound is infected. When do bites happen? Although you may be more worried about bites from wild and stray animals, any animal has the potential to bite. Many bites are actually caused by a person's own pet or an animal belonging to a friend or neighbour. Animals can act unpredictably and bites aren't always provoked. However, an animal is more likely to bite if it's been disturbed, feels threatened, or gets overexcited. Most human bites occur when one person punches another person in the mouth. They can also happen during contact sports, vigorous sex, domestic violence or sexual assault, and fits (seizures). How to avoid animal bites Most animal bites are caused by dogs. The advice below may help reduce the chances of being bitten: never leave a young child unsupervised with a dog \u2013 regardless of what type of dog it is and its previous behaviour treat dogs with respect \u2013 don't approach them suddenly, run around screaming in their presence, or interrupt them when they're eating or sleeping avoid stroking or petting unfamiliar dogs \u2013 when greeting a dog for the first time, let it sniff you before petting it It's also a good idea to avoid contact with any wild or stray animals, particularly while travelling abroad, as they can be aggressive and there's a chance they could carry serious infections, such as rabies.

How do I know if my ankle is broken? If you injure your ankle, the following can be signs of a fracture: pain and tenderness \u2013 particularly in the bones around the ankle being unable to walk or put any weight on the ankle swelling and significant bruising a 'crack' sound during the injury the ankle being a funny shape (dislocated) bone poking out of the skin (open or compound fracture) Because of the shock and pain of breaking your ankle, you may also feel faint, dizzy or sick. If the injury is not severe it can be difficult to tell if your ankle is broken or just sprained. An X-ray is needed to confirm whether the ankle is broken and help determine the most appropriate treatment. What you should do If you think you may have broken your ankle, go to your nearest accident & emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible. If it feels like only a minor fracture and it is not an emergency, it may be more appropriate to go to a minor injuries unit. Try to avoid putting any weight on the ankle. Ask a friend or relative to drive you to hospital and support your weight as you walk on your other foot. Raising the leg and applying an ice pack (try a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) can help reduce pain and swelling while you make your way to hospital. You can also take over-the-counter painkillers, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, to help relieve the pain. Call 999 for an ambulance if the ankle looks like it might be dislocated, or you can see bones poking through the skin. How a broken ankle is treated If your ankle is dislocated or the bones are badly misaligned (displaced) the doctor or paramedic may decide to manipulate them back into place (reduction). This is to avoid potential problems with the blood and nerve supply to the foot. A splint will then usually be applied to protect your ankle and keep the bones in the correct position while you are transferred to an accident and emergency department. You will be given strong painkillers or sedation to ensure your comfort during this procedure. At the hospital, your doctor will then decide whether you need surgery or if you just need a cast to support your ankle as it heals naturally. An X-ray is needed to confirm the fracture and to help decide on the appropriate treatment. Cast Most ankle fractures will need to be put in a plaster cast or splint for around six weeks. You'll usually be advised not to put any weight on the broken ankle for at least the first few weeks so you will need to use crutches to support yourself. This will depend on your fracture and in some cases you will be advised to walk on the ankle. Over the next few weeks, you'll normally be asked to attend follow-up appointments with an orthopaedic surgeon (a specialist in problems affecting the bones and joints) at a fracture clinic. Your doctor can advise you about things you can do to help your ankle heal and further X-rays may be carried out to make sure it's healing correctly. They may also replace your original plaster cast with a lighter one or a special removable boot as you recover. Surgery More severe fractures often require surgery to realign the bones and fix them in position. This is usually carried out under a general anaesthetic (where you are put to sleep). The surgeon makes cuts in the skin near the ankle and the bones are put back into position. A combination of plates, screws and wires may be used to hold the bones together, and the wound is closed using stitches. The metalwork is not normally removed later on unless it becomes a problem. Most people will stay in hospital for one or two days after surgery. A plaster cast will be placed over the ankle to protect it before you go home. Recovering It takes about six to 12 weeks for a broken ankle to heal, but it may take longer to regain full movement and return to all of your normal activities. Swelling can sometimes take a few years to improve. Ask friends or family to go shopping for you, as you won't be able to do this yourself. You will, however, be able to move around your home on crutches and manage stairs. How soon you can return to work depends on how badly you fractured your ankle and the type of work you do, but you will probably be off for at least four to six weeks. Follow your doctor or surgeon's advice on elevating, moving and resting the ankle, and make sure you attend all follow-up appointments after you have been discharged from hospital. If necessary, you may be referred to a physiotherapist who can show you exercises that may help speed up your recovery. Read more about caring for a plaster cast. When to see your GP Check the ankle regularly and see your GP if: the pain gets worse or is not relieved by ordinary painkillers \u2013 your GP may be able to prescribe a stronger painkiller you develop any other medical problems or want advice about returning to work you are planning on flying after ankle surgery \u2013 having recent surgery can increase your risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and your GP can advise you whether it's safe to fly When to go back to hospital Go back to your nearest A&E department if: you have pins and needles or numbness in your toes the skin around your ankle or foot has turned blue the ankle becomes very swollen you\u2019re having problems with your plaster cast there is a foul-smelling discharge from a surgical wound on your ankle These signs may indicate an infection or a problem with the nerves or blood supply to the ankle.

AS tends to first develop in teenagers and young adults. It is also around three times more common in men than in women. Symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis The symptoms of AS can vary, but usually involve: back pain and stiffness pain and swelling in other parts of the body \u2013 caused by inflammation of the joints (arthritis) and inflammation where a tendon joins a bone (enthesitis) extreme tiredness (fatigue) These symptoms tend to develop gradually, usually over several months or years, and may come and go over time. In some people the condition gets better with time, but for others it can get slowly worse. Read about symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis. When to seek medical advice You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of AS. If your GP thinks you may have the condition, they should refer you to a specialist in conditions affecting muscles and joints (rheumatologist) for further tests and any necessary treatment. Further tests may include blood tests and imaging tests. Read about diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis. Causes of ankylosing spondylitis In AS various areas of the spine and other joints become inflamed. As well as causing pain, stiffness and swelling, this inflammation can damage affected areas of the body over time. In some cases this can lead to some of the individual bones of the spine joining together (fusing), known as ankylosis. It's not known what causes the condition, but there's thought to be a link with a particular gene known as HLA-B27. Read about the causes of ankylosing spondylitis. Treating ankylosing spondylitis There's no cure for AS and it's not possible to reverse the damage caused by the condition. However, treatment is available to relieve the symptoms and help prevent or delay its progression. In most cases treatment involves a combination of: exercises carried out individually or in groups to reduce pain and stiffness physiotherapy \u2013 where physical methods, such as massage and manipulation, are used to improve comfort and spinal flexibility medication to help relieve pain and reduce inflammation \u2013 such as painkillers, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) medication and other forms of biological therapy Surgery is sometimes needed to repair significantly damaged joints or correct severe bends in the spine, but this is uncommon. Read about treating ankylosing spondylitis. Complications of ankylosing spondylitis The outlook for AS is highly variable. For some people the condition improves after an initial period of inflammation, whereas for others it can get progressively worse over time. Around 70-90% of people with AS remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long term. However, some people eventually become severely disabled as a result of the bones in their spine fusing in a fixed position and damage to other joints, such as the hips or knees. With modern treatments, AS doesn't normally affect life expectancy significantly, although the condition is associated with an increased risk of other potentially life-threatening problems. For example, AS can lead to: weakening of the bones (osteoporosis) spinal fractures cardiovascular disease \u2013 a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels chest infections rarely, kidney disease Read about the complications of ankylosing spondylitis. Information about you If you have AS, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the AS register.

People with anorexia usually do this by restricting the amount of food they eat, making themselves vomit, and exercising excessively.  The condition often develops out of an anxiety about body shape and weight that originates from a fear of being fat or a desire to be thin. Many people with anorexia have a distorted image of themselves, thinking they're fat when they're not. Anorexia most commonly affects girls and women, although it has become more common in boys and men in recent years. On average, the condition first develops at around the age of 16 to 17. Read more about the causes of anorexia. Signs and symptoms of anorexia People with anorexia often go to great lengths to hide their behaviour from family and friends by lying about what they've eaten or pretending to have eaten earlier. Signs someone may have anorexia or another eating disorder include: missing meals, eating very little, or avoiding eating any fatty foods obsessively counting calories in food  leaving the table immediately after eating so they can vomit taking appetite suppressants, laxatives, or diuretics (a type of medication that helps remove fluid from the body) repeatedly weighing themselves or checking their body in the mirror physical problems, such as feeling lightheaded or dizzy, hair loss, or dry skin Anorexia can also be associated with other psychological problems, such as depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, alcohol misuse, and self-harm. Read more about the symptoms of anorexia. Getting help People with anorexia often don't seek help, perhaps because they're afraid or don't recognise they have a problem. Many have hidden their condition for a long time \u2013 sometimes years. The most important first step is for someone with anorexia to realise they need help and want to get better. If you think someone you know has anorexia, try talking to them about your worries and encourage them to seek help. This can be a very difficult conversation because they may be defensive and refuse to accept they have a problem. However, it's important not to criticise or pressure them as this can make things worse. You may want to seek advice from an eating disorder support group such as Beat about the best way to raise the subject. If you think you may have anorexia, try to seek help as soon as possible. You could start by talking to a person you trust, such as a member of your family or a friend, and perhaps ask them to go with you to see your GP. Read more about supporting someone with an eating disorder and advice for parents of a child with an eating disorder. Treating anorexia Before anorexia can be treated, a physical, psychological and social needs assessment will need to be carried out by a GP or an eating disorders specialist. This will help them work out a suitable care plan. In most cases, treatment will involve a combination of psychological therapy and individually tailored advice on eating and nutrition to help gain weight safely. A range of different healthcare professionals will usually be involved in your care, such as GPs, psychiatrists, specialist nurses and dietitians. Most people are able to be treated on an outpatient basis, which means you can go home between appointments. More serious cases are treated in hospital or specialist eating disorder clinics. Read more about diagnosing anorexia and treating anorexia. Outlook It can take several years of treatment to fully recover from anorexia, and relapses are common. For example, a woman may relapse if she tries to lose weight gained during pregnancy. Around half of people with anorexia will continue to have some level of eating problem despite treatment. If anorexia remains unsuccessfully treated for a long time, a number of other serious problems can develop. These can include fragile bones (osteoporosis), infertility, an irregular heartbeat, and other heart problems. Despite being an uncommon condition, anorexia is one of the leading causes of mental health-related deaths. This can be because of the effects of malnutrition or as a result of suicide.

It's usually caused by a nasal condition or brain injury, but some people are born without a sense of smell (congenital anosmia). Losing your sense of smell can be very depressing and isolating. It means missing out on many experiences most of us take for granted, such as smelling fresh flowers, perfume or the scent of a loved one. Smell also plays an important role in how you taste things. Many people with anosmia lose interest in food, because 80% of the flavour of food comes from its smell. If you've suddenly lost your sense of smell and don't know why, see your GP. They may be able to diagnose an underlying cause (see below) and offer treatment to restore your sense of smell. Seeing your GP Your GP will want to take your full medical history, examine the inside of your nose and take a blood sample for testing in a laboratory. Your doctor may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist in hospital. Further tests, such as a CT scan, MRI scan or nasal endoscopy (where a thin tube with a camera is inserted up your nose), can be used to investigate the cause. What are the causes? There are several medical conditions and medications associated with a loss of smell. The possible causes include: a viral infection affecting the upper respiratory tract, such as a cold persistent (chronic) sinusitis, with or without nasal polyps a nose abnormality, such as a crooked nose or a nasal septum (wall dividing the nostrils) that isn't straight hay fever (rhinitis) that causes severe inflammation of the nasal passages certain medication, including antibiotics such as metronidazole recreational drug use such as cocaine or amphetamines diabetes long-term alcohol misuse an underactive thyroid Cushing's syndrome (high levels of the hormone cortisol in the blood) exposure to a chemical that burns the inside of the nose a head injury a brain tumour radiotherapy to the head and neck epilepsy Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease stroke liver or kidney disease vitamin B12 deficiency schizophrenia granulomatosis with polyangiitis \u2013 an uncommon disorder of the blood vessels sarcoidosis \u2013 a rare disease that causes body cells to form into clumps In general, anosmia is usually caused by either a problem with odours getting to the top of the nose (because of swelling or a blockage in the nose) or a problem with nerve signals from the nose to the brain. However, in around 20% of cases, the cause can't be found. This is known as idiopathic anosmia. Congenital anosmia An estimated 6,000 people in the UK are born without a sense of smell because of a genetic condition or faulty gene. This is known as congenital anosmia. It can occur alone (isolated congenital anosmia) or it can be a symptom of another genetic condition, such as Kallmann syndrome or Klinefelter syndrome. Can anosmia be cured? Whether or not anosmia can be cured depends on the underlying cause. People with congenital anosmia have a lifelong inability to smell and have no concept of what a smell even is. Currently, there's no known cure or treatment for congenital anosmia. However, other types of anosmia may be improved or cured when the underlying condition is treated. For example, if the cause is swelling in the nose or sinuses, steroids can usually clear this up and restore your sense of smell. Treatments that may help, depending on your condition, are: nasal washing (douching) a steroid nasal spray an antihistamine steroid tablets an operation to have nasal polyps removed an operation to straighten the nasal septum an operation to clear out the sinuses, called endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) (see below) These treatments may come with unpleasant side effects. Speak to your doctor about whether any of these treatments may be suitable for you and, if so, what side effects you may experience. ESS In bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), the surgeon opens all your sinuses and clears them out to reduce inflammation and allow nasal rinses and sprays to reach them. In some centres, this may involve the use of an image guidance system (IGS) to map out your sinuses. ESS also involves removing any polyps present at the same time. This treatment can bring back some sense of smell for many people with anosmia when medication alone has failed. However, if you don't keep taking your nasal medications afterwards, the anosmia is likely to return. If you've had surgery to remove nasal polyps, it's quite common for these to grow back, and many people find they need another operation. However, ESS may reduce the need for further surgery. A recent journal publication looked at how successful ESS with IGS was in treating patients with chronic frontal sinusitis, some of whom also had nasal polyps. Data from a five-year period showed that only four patients out of 141 (3%) needed to have further surgery after having ESS with IGS as their first operation. IGS is not available in all hospitals, but may be performed by specialist centres where possible. Safety If you have anosmia, you'll need to take special precautions because you won't be able to smell fires, poisonous fumes, leaking gas or food that has gone off. It's recommended that you: install smoke alarms in all areas of the home, especially in the kitchen and near the fireplace change from natural gas appliances to electric or consider installing a natural gas detector clearly mark expiry dates on food and mark leftovers with dates, so you know when to throw them away carefully read warning labels on products such as bathroom and kitchen cleaners, and insecticides, to be aware of potent chemicals Some people with anosmia also experience a loss of appetite, but it's important to maintain your nutrition levels. It may help to set reminders for mealtimes and weigh yourself regularly to ensure you stay healthy.

But occasionally they can become infected, cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or spread serious illnesses such as Lyme disease and malaria. Bugs that bite or sting include wasps, hornets, bees, horseflies, ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, spiders and midges. This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you've been bitten or stung When to get medical advice When to get emergency medical help Prevention Symptoms of insect bites and stings Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Some people have a mild allergic reaction and a larger area of skin around the bite or sting becomes swollen, red and painful. This should pass within a week. Occasionally, a severe allergic reaction can occur, causing symptoms such as breathing difficulties, dizziness and a swollen face or mouth. This requires immediate medical treatment (see below). Read more about the symptoms of common insect bites and stings. What to do if you've been bitten or stung To treat an insect bite or sting: Remove the sting or tick if it's still in the skin (see treating insect bites and stings for advice about how to do this safely). Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they're unlikely to help. The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. Ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments that can help, such as painkillers, creams for itching and antihistamines. Read more about treatments for insect bites and stings. When to get medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if: you're worried about a bite or sting your symptoms don't start to improve within a few days or are getting worse you've been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes a large area (around 10cm or more) around the bite becomes red and swollen you have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness you have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a fever, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms When to get emergency medical help Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe reaction, such as: wheezing or difficulty breathing a swollen face, mouth or throat nausea or vomiting a fast heart rate dizziness or feeling faint difficulty swallowing loss of consciousness Emergency treatment in hospital is needed in these cases. Prevent insect bites and stings There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin \u2013 repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants \u2013 these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. You may need to take extra precautions if you're travelling to part of the world where there's a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about how to prevent insect bites and stings.

They're available over the counter from pharmacies and are often used to treat the symptoms of heartburn and indigestion. How antacids work Antacids counteract (neutralise) the acid in your stomach that's used to aid digestion. This helps reduce the symptoms of heartburn and relieves pain. Some antacids also coat the surface of the oesophagus (gullet) with a protective barrier against stomach acid, or produce a gel on the stomach\u2019s surface which helps stop acid leaking into the oesophagus and causing acid reflux. Different types of antacids Antacids are available in liquid form or as chewable tablets. They're sold under various brand names but contain common ingredients, including: aluminium hydroxide magnesium carbonate magnesium trisilicate Extra ingredients are sometimes added to help treat other problems, such as simeticone to relieve flatulence (wind), and alginates to prevent acid flowing into your oesophagus. Who can't take antacids? Antacids aren't suitable for everyone. For example, many antacids aren't recommended for children under the age of 12 and people with certain health conditions, such as kidney disease. Antacids can also interfere with other medications, so you may not be able to take them while you're being treated for another condition. Antacids are generally considered safe to take during pregnancy, but you should discuss it with your GP or pharmacist beforehand. Read more about who can't take antacid medicines. Possible side effects of antacids Like all medicines, antacids can have side effects. Common side effects include: diarrhoea constipation flatulence stomach cramps feeling sick or vomiting If you have diarrhoea or constipation after taking antacids it may be possible to switch to an alternative medicine. Speak to your GP or pharmacist for advice. Any side effects you experience while taking antacids should pass once you stop taking the medication. Visit your GP if they continue. Missed or extra doses When taking antacid medicines, follow the instructions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine or the advice of your GP or pharmacist. If you miss a dose, it won't usually be necessary to alter your next dose. It's likely that you can carry on taking your normal dose. However, for specific advice about what to do, refer to the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. Taking extra doses could cause several unpleasant side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation. Contact your GP or pharmacist immediately if you think that you've taken more antacids than you should have. Alternatively, you can call NHS 111 for advice.

Telling your GP and\/or midwife promptly will help to make sure you receive maternity healthcare that takes into account all your health needs and preferences. Find maternity units in your area. You can read all the information on this page, or click on the links below to go straight to the relevant section: What is antenatal care? Starting your antenatal care How many appointments you'll have Your first visit and booking appointment Later visits Checking your baby's development and wellbeing Your maternity notes What is antenatal care? Antenatal care is the care you receive from healthcare professionals during your pregnancy. You'll be offered a series of appointments with a midwife, or sometimes with a doctor who specialises in pregnancy and birth (an obstetrician). They will check that you and your baby are well, give you useful information to help you have a healthy pregnancy (including healthy eating and exercise advice) and answer any questions you may have. You will also be offered antenatal classes, including breastfeeding workshops. You need to book antenatal classes in advance, so ask your midwife about when you should book classes in your area. Starting antenatal care You can book an appointment with your GP or directly with your midwife as soon as you know that you're pregnant. Your GP surgery or a Children\u2019s Centre can put you in touch with your nearest midwifery service.  It's best to see them as early as possible to obtain the information you need to have a healthy pregnancy, and because some tests, such as screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia should be done before you're 10 weeks' pregnant. If you have special health needs, your midwife, GP or obstetrician may take shared responsibility for your maternity care. This means they will all see you during your pregnancy. Let your midwife know if you have a disability that means you have special requirements for your antenatal appointments or for labour. If you don't speak English, let your midwife know and arrangements will be made. Antenatal appointments If you're expecting your first child, you'll have up to 10 antenatal appointments. If you've had a baby before, you'll have around seven antenatal appointments. Under certain circumstances, for example if you develop a medical condition, you may have more. Early in your pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will give you written information about how many appointments you're likely to have and when they'll happen. You should have a chance to discuss the schedule with them. If you can't keep an antenatal appointment, let the clinic or midwife know and make another appointment. Your appointments can take place at your home, in a Children's Centre, in your GP surgery or in hospital. You will usually go to the hospital for your scans. Your antenatal appointments should take place in a setting where you feel able to discuss sensitive issues that may affect you, such as domestic violence, sexual abuse, mental illness or drugs. To give you the best pregnancy care, your midwife will ask you many questions about your health, your family's health and your preferences. Your midwife will do some checks and tests, some of which will be done throughout your pregnancy. The results of these tests may affect your choices later in pregnancy, so it\u2019s important not to miss them. Your midwife will also ask about any other social care support you may have or need, such as support from social workers or family liaison officers. Your first visit Your first visit with your midwife or GP is the appointment when you tell them that you're pregnant. At this first visit, you will be given information about:  folic acid and vitamin D supplements nutrition, diet and food hygiene lifestyle factors that may affect your health or the health of your baby, such as smoking, recreational drug use and drinking alcohol  antenatal screening tests, including screening for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia, infectious diseases and screening for Down's syndrome. You should be offered screening for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia before 10 weeks. This is so you and your partner can find out about all your options and make an informed decision if your baby is at risk of inheriting one of these conditions. They will give you information on keeping healthy, and ask whether you have had any previous health or pregnancy issues, such as complications in pregnancy. It's important to tell your midwife or doctor if: you've had any complications or infections in a previous pregnancy or delivery, such as pre-eclampsia or premature birth  you're being treated for a chronic disease, such as diabetes or high blood pressure  you or anyone in your family have previously had a baby with an abnormality, such as spina bifida  there's a family history of an inherited disease, such as sickle cell or cystic fibrosis you know that you are a genetic carrier for an inherited condition such as sickle cell or thalassaemia. You should also tell the midwife if you know the baby's biological father is a genetic carrier for one of these conditions you have had fertility treatment and either a donor egg or donor sperm An important part of antenatal care is getting information that will help you to make informed choices about your pregnancy. Your midwife or doctor will give you information in writing or some other form that you can easily use and understand. They can provide you with information in an appropriate format if you:  have a physical, learning or sensory disability do not speak English The booking appointment Your next appointment should happen when you are 8-12 weeks pregnant. This is called the booking appointment. It will last for up to two hours, and could take place either at a hospital or in the community, for example in a clinic at a health centre, in a GP surgery or at home. You'll see a midwife and sometimes a doctor. You may also be offered an ultrasound scan. You will be given information about: how the baby develops during pregnancy (see the pregnancy development slideshow) nutrition and diet general exercise and pelvic floor exercises antenatal screening tests your antenatal care and antenatal classes breastfeeding workshops  maternity and paternity benefits  planning your labour and where to have your baby  The midwife or doctor will ask questions to build up a picture of you and your pregnancy. This is to make sure you're given the support you need, and so that any risks are spotted early. You will probably want to ask a lot of questions. It often helps to write down what you want to say in advance, as it\u2019s easy to forget once you're there. It\u2019s important to find out what you want to know and to talk about your own feelings and preferences. Several antenatal screening tests are performed on a sample of your blood which is usually taken at your booking appointment.  Questions you might be asked The midwife or doctor might ask about: the date of the first day of your last period  your health any previous illnesses and operations any previous pregnancies and miscarriages  ethnic origins of you and your partner, to find out whether your baby is at risk of certain inherited conditions, or other relevant factors, such as whether your family has a history of twins your job or your partner's job, and what kind of accommodation you live in to see whether your circumstances might affect your pregnancy how you're feeling and whether you've been feeling depressed Your booking appointment is an opportunity to tell your midwife or doctor if you're in a vulnerable situation or if you need extra support. This could be due to domestic abuse or violence, sexual abuse or female genital mutilation. Later antenatal visits From around 24 weeks, your antenatal appointments will usually become more frequent. However, if your pregnancy is uncomplicated and you are in good health, you may not be seen as often as someone who needs to be more closely monitored. Later visits are usually quite short. Your midwife or doctor will:  check your urine and blood pressure feel your abdomen (tummy) to check the baby's position measure your uterus (womb) to check your baby's growth listen to your baby's heartbeat if you want them to You can also ask questions or talk about anything that's worrying you. Talking about your feelings is as important as all the antenatal tests and examinations. You should be given information about: your birth plan  preparing for labour and birth how to tell if you're in active labour induction of labour if your baby is overdue (after your expected date of delivery)  the \"baby blues\" and postnatal depression feeding your baby vitamin K (which is given to prevent bleeding caused by vitamin K deficiency in your baby) screening tests for newborn babies looking after yourself and your new baby The NICE antenatal care guidelines (from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) give useful information on the timing of visits during pregnancy and a description of what will happen each time. Checking your baby's development and wellbeing At each antenatal appointment from 24 weeks of pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will check your baby's growth. To do this, they'll measure the distance from the top of your womb to your pubic bone. The measurement will be recorded in your notes. In the last weeks of pregnancy, you may also be asked to keep track of your baby's movements. If your baby's movements become less frequent, slow down or stop, contact your midwife or doctor immediately. You'll be offered an ultrasound scan if they have any concerns about how your baby is growing and developing. Your maternity notes At your booking appointment, your midwife will enter your details in a record book and will add to them at each visit. These are your maternity notes, sometimes called handheld notes. You\u2019ll be asked to keep your maternity notes at home and to bring them along to all your antenatal appointments. Take your notes with you wherever you go in case you need medical attention while you're away from home. Always ask your maternity team to explain anything in your notes that you don't understand. Waiting times in clinics can vary, and having to wait a long time for an appointment can be particularly difficult if you have young children with you. Planning ahead can make your visits easier, so here are some suggestions:  Write a list of any questions you want to ask and take it with you. Make sure you get answers to your questions or the opportunity to discuss any worries. If your partner is free, they may be able to go with you. This can make them feel more involved in the pregnancy. In some clinics you can buy refreshments. If not, take a snack with you if you're likely to get hungry. Find out about your schedule of antenatal appointments and what to expect at each one.

It involves removing and testing a small sample of cells from amniotic fluid, which surrounds the foetus in the womb (uterus). When amniocentesis is offered Amniocentesis isn't routinely offered to all pregnant women. It's only offered if there's a high risk your baby could have a genetic condition. This could be because: an earlier antenatal screening test has suggested there may be a problem, such as Down's syndrome, spina bifida or sickle cell anaemia you've had a previous pregnancy with these problems you have a family history of a genetic condition, such as cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy, and an abnormality is detected in your baby during a routine ultrasound scan It's important to remember that you don't have to have amniocentesis if it's offered. It's up to you to decide whether you want it. Your midwife or doctor will speak to you about what the test involves, and let you know what the possible benefits and risks are, to help you make a decision. Read more about why amniocentesis is offered and deciding whether to have it. How amniocentesis is performed Amniocentesis is usually carried out between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy, but may be performed later than this if necessary. Although it can be performed earlier, this may increase the risk of complications of amniocentesis and is usually avoided. During the test, a long, thin needle is inserted through your abdominal wall, guided by an ultrasound image. The needle is passed into the amniotic sac that surrounds the foetus and a small sample of amniotic fluid is removed for analysis. The test itself usually takes about 10 minutes, although the whole consultation may take about 30 minutes. Amniocentesis is usually described as being uncomfortable rather than painful. Some women describe experiencing a pain similar to period pain or feeling pressure when the needle is taken out. Read more about what happens during amniocentesis. Getting your results The first results of the test should be available within three working days and this will tell you whether Down's, Edward's or Patau's syndrome has been discovered. If rarer conditions are also being tested for, it can take two to three weeks or more for the results to come back. If your test shows that your baby has a serious inherited or genetic disorder, the implications will be fully discussed with you. There's no cure for most of the conditions amniocentesis finds, so you'll need to consider your options carefully. You may choose to continue with your pregnancy, while gathering information about the condition so you're fully prepared, or you may consider having a termination (abortion). Read more about the results of amniocentesis. What are the risks of amniocentesis? Before you decide to have amniocentesis, the risks and possible complications will be discussed with you. One of the main risks associated with amniocentesis is miscarriage, which is the loss of the pregnancy in the first 23 weeks. This is estimated to occur in 1% of women who have amniocentesis. There are also some other risks, such as infection or needing to have the procedure again because it wasn't possible to accurately test the first sample that was removed. The risk of amniocentesis causing complications is higher if it's carried out before the 15th week of pregnancy, which is why the test is only carried out after this point. Read more about the possible complications of amniocentesis. What are the alternatives? An alternative to amniocentesis is a test called chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This is where a small sample of cells from the placenta (the organ that links the mother's blood supply with her unborn baby's) are removed for testing. It's usually carried out between the 11th and 14th weeks of pregnancy, although it can be performed later than this if necessary. With CVS, the risk of miscarriage is about 1-2%, which is slightly higher than the risk of miscarriage for amniocentesis. However, as the test can be carried out earlier, you'll have more time to consider the results. If you're offered tests to look for a genetic disorder in your baby, a specialist involved in carrying out the test will be able to discuss the different options with you, and help you make a decision.

The CVS procedure is usually described as being uncomfortable rather than painful, although you may experience some cramps that are similar to period pains for a day or two afterwards.

It's usually carried out between the 15th and 18th week of pregnancy, although it can be performed later than this if necessary. This test may have a slightly smaller risk of causing a miscarriage, but your pregnancy will be at a more advanced stage before you can get the results, so you'll have a bit less time to consider your options. If you're offered tests to look for a genetic disorder in your baby, a specialist involved in carrying out the test will be able to discuss the different options with you, and help you make a decision.

They work by killing bacteria or preventing them from reproducing and spreading. Antibiotics aren't effective against viral infections, such as the common cold, flu, most coughs and sore throats. Many mild bacterial infections can also be cleared by your immune system without using antibiotics, so they aren't routinely prescribed. It's important that antibiotics are prescribed and taken correctly to help prevent the progression of antibiotic resistance. This is when a strain of bacteria no longer responds to treatment with one or more types of antibiotics. When antibiotics are used Antibiotics may be used to treat bacterial infections that: are unlikely to clear up without antibiotics could infect others unless treated could take too long to clear without treatment carry a risk of more serious complications People at a high risk of infection may also be given antibiotics as a precaution, known as antibiotic prophylaxis. Read more about when antibiotics are used. How do I take antibiotics? Take antibiotics as directed on the packet or the patient information leaflet that comes with the medication, or as instructed by your GP or pharmacist. Doses of antibiotics can be provided in several ways: oral antibiotics \u2013 tablets, capsules or a liquid that you drink, which can be used to treat most types of mild to moderate infections in the body topical antibiotics \u2013 creams, lotions, sprays or drops, which are often used to treat skin infections injections of antibiotics \u2013 these can be given as an injection or infusion through a drip directly into the blood or muscle, and are usually reserved for more serious infections It's essential to finish taking a prescribed course of antibiotics, even if you feel better, unless a healthcare professional tells you otherwise. If you stop taking an antibiotic part way through a course, the bacteria can become resistant to the antibiotic. Missing a dose of antibiotics If you forget to take a dose of your antibiotics, take that dose as soon as you remember and then continue to take your course of antibiotics as normal. But if it's almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one. There's an increased risk of side effects if you take two doses closer together than recommended. Accidentally taking an extra dose Accidentally taking one extra dose of your antibiotic is unlikely to cause you any serious harm. But it will increase your chances of experiencing side effects, such as pain in your stomach, diarrhoea, and feeling or being sick. If you accidentally take more than one extra dose of your antibiotic, are worried or experiencing severe side effects, speak to your GP or call NHS 111 as soon as possible. Side effects of antibiotics As with any medication, antibiotics can cause side effects. Most antibiotics don't cause problems if they're used properly and serious side effects are rare. The most common side effects include: being sick feeling sick bloating and indigestion diarrhoea Some people may have an allergic reaction to antibiotics, especially penicillin and a type called cephalosporins. In very rare cases, this can lead to a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which is a medical emergency. Read more about the side effects of antibiotics. Considerations and interactions Some antibiotics aren't suitable for people with certain medical conditions, or women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. You should only ever take antibiotics prescribed for you \u2013 never \"borrow\" them from a friend or family member. Some antibiotics can also react unpredictably with other medications, such as the oral contraceptive pill and alcohol. It's important to read the information leaflet that comes with your medication carefully and discuss any concerns with your pharmacist or GP. Read more about: things to consider before taking antibiotics how antibiotics interact with other medicines Types of antibiotics There are hundreds of different types of antibiotics, but most of them can be broadly classified into six groups. These are outlined below. penicillins (such as penicillin and amoxicillin) \u2013 widely used to treat a variety of infections, including skin infections, chest infections and urinary tract infections cephalosporins (such as cephalexin) \u2013 used to treat a wide range of infections, but some are also effective for treating more serious infections, such as septicaemia and meningitis aminoglycosides (such as gentamicin and tobramycin) \u2013 tend to only be used in hospital to treat very serious illnesses such as septicaemia, as they can cause serious side effects, including hearing loss and kidney damage; they're usually given by injection, but may be given as drops for some ear or eye infections tetracyclines (such as tetracycline and doxycycline)\u2013 can be used to treat a wide range of infections, but are commonly used to treat moderate to severe acne and rosacea macrolides (such as erythromycin and clarithromycin) \u2013 can be particularly useful for treating lung and chest infections, or an alternative for people with a penicillin allergy, or to treat penicillin-resistant strains of bacteria fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) \u2013 broad-spectrum antibiotics that can be used to treat a wide range of infections Antibiotic resistance Both the NHS and health organisations across the world are trying to reduce the use of antibiotics, especially for conditions that aren't serious. The overuse of antibiotics in recent years means they're becoming less effective and has led to the emergence of \"superbugs\". These are strains of bacteria that have developed resistance to many different types of antibiotics, including: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)  Clostridium difficile (C. diff) the bacteria that cause multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) These types of infections can be serious and challenging to treat, and are becoming an increasing cause of disability and death across the world. The biggest worry is that new strains of bacteria may emerge that can't be effectively treated by any existing antibiotics.

They're given to people at a high risk of getting clots, to reduce their chances of developing serious conditions such as strokes and heart attacks. A blood clot is a seal created by the blood to stop bleeding from wounds. While they're useful in stopping bleeding, they can block blood vessels and stop blood flowing to organs such as the brain, heart or lungs if they form in the wrong place. Anticoagulants work by interrupting the process involved in the formation of blood clots. They're sometimes called \"blood-thinning\" medicines, although they don't actually make the blood thinner. Although they're used for similar purposes, anticoagulants are different to antiplatelet medicines, such as low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel. Types of anticoagulants The most commonly prescribed anticoagulant is warfarin. Newer types of anticoagulants are also available and are becoming increasingly common. These include: apixaban (Eliquis)  dabigatran (Pradaxa)  rivaroxaban (Xarelto)  Warfarin and the newer alternatives are taken as tablets or capsules. There's also an anticoagulant called heparin that can be given by injection. When anticoagulants are used If a blood clot blocks the flow of blood through a blood vessel, the affected part of the body will become starved of oxygen and will stop working properly. Depending on where the clot forms, this can lead to serious problems such as: strokes or transient ischaemic attacks (\"mini-strokes\") heart attacks deep vein thrombosis (DVT) pulmonary embolism Treatment with anticoagulants may be recommended if your doctor feels you're at an increased risk of developing one of these problems. This may be because you've had blood clots in the past or you've been diagnosed with a condition such as atrial fibrillation that can cause blood clots to form. You may also be prescribed an anticoagulant if you've recently had surgery, as the period of rest and inactivity you need during your recovery can increase your risk of developing a blood clot. Read more about when anticoagulants are used. How to take anticoagulants Your doctor or nurse should tell you how much of your anticoagulant medicine to take and when to take it.  Most people need to take their tablets or capsules once or twice a day with water or food. The length of time you need to keep taking your medicine for depends on why it's been prescribed. In many cases, treatment will be lifelong. If you're unsure how to take your medicine, or are worried that you missed a dose or have taken too much, check the patient information leaflet that comes with it or ask your GP, anticoagulant clinic or pharmacist what to do. You can also call NHS 111 for advice. Read more about anticoagulant doses. Things to consider when taking anticoagulants There are several things you need to be aware of when taking anticoagulant medicines. If you're going to have surgery or a test such as an endoscopy, make sure your doctor or surgeon is aware that you're taking anticoagulants, as you may have to stop taking them for a short time. Speak to your GP, anticoagulant clinic or pharmacist before taking any other medications, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, as some medications can affect how your anticoagulant works. If you're taking warfarin, you'll also need to avoid making significant changes to what you normally eat and drink, as this can affect your medication. Most anticoagulant medicines aren't suitable for pregnant women. Speak to your GP or anticoagulant clinic if you become pregnant or are planning to try for a baby while taking anticoagulants. Read more about things to consider when taking anticoagulants. Side effects of anticoagulants Like all medicines, there's a risk of experiencing side effects while taking anticoagulants. The main side effect is that you can bleed too easily, which can cause problems such as: passing blood in your urine passing blood when you poo or having black poo severe bruising prolonged nosebleeds bleeding gums vomiting blood or coughing up blood heavy periods in women For most people, the benefits of taking anticoagulants will outweigh the risk of excessive bleeding.

Oral means it's taken by mouth. An anticoagulant is a medicine that stops blood clotting. Clotting (thickening) is a complex process involving a number of substances called clotting factors. Clotting factors are produced by the liver and help control bleeding. They work with cells that trigger the clotting process (platelets) to ensure blood clots effectively. To produce some of the clotting factors, the liver needs a good supply of vitamin K. Warfarin blocks one of the enzymes (proteins) that uses vitamin K to produce clotting factors. This disrupts the clotting process, making it take longer for the blood to clot. This page covers: When warfarin is prescribed Taking warfarin Side effects of warfarin Interactions Other useful information When warfarin is prescribed Anticoagulant medicines, such as warfarin, are often prescribed for people who've had a condition caused by a blood clot, such as: a stroke a heart attack deep vein thrombosis \u2013 a blood clot within a deep vein in the body, usually in a leg pulmonary embolism \u2013 a blood clot in the lungs Warfarin may also be prescribed for people at an increased risk of developing harmful blood clots, such as those with: a replacement or mechanical (prosthetic) heart valve an irregular heart rhythm, known as atrial fibrillation a blood clotting disorder, such as thrombophilia an increased risk of blood clots following surgery Taking warfarin It's very important that you take warfarin exactly as directed. Don't increase your prescribed dose unless the doctor in charge of your care advises you to. Warfarin is taken once a day, usually in the evening. It's important to take your dose at the same time each day, before, during or after a meal. The aim of warfarin therapy is to decrease the blood's tendency to clot, but not stop it clotting completely. This means the dose of warfarin you're taking must be carefully monitored and, if necessary, adjusted. You'll have regular blood tests at your GP surgery or local anticoagulant clinic to make sure your dose is correct. The international normalised ratio (INR) is a measure of how long it takes your blood to clot.  The longer it takes your blood to clot, the higher your INR. Your INR will be used to determine the dose of warfarin you need to take. Although there are now three new anticoagulants that don't require regular monitoring \u2013 rivaroxaban, apixaban and dabigatran \u2013 most people who need an anticoagulant will be prescribed warfarin. When you start taking warfarin, you may be given a yellow booklet about anticoagulants, which explains your treatment. How long you'll need to take warfarin for will depend on the condition for which it's been prescribed. Ask the healthcare professional responsible for your care if you're not sure. Missed doses If you usually take warfarin in the morning and forget to take it at your normal time, take it as soon as you remember and continue as normal. However, if it's time to take your next dose, don't take a double dose to catch up, unless your GP has specifically advised you to. If you forget to take your dose of warfarin in the evening but remember before midnight on the same day, take the missed dose. If midnight has passed, leave that dose and take your normal dose the next day at the usual time. Ask your GP or staff at your local anticoagulant clinic if you're not sure what to do about a missed dose of warfarin. You can also call NHS 111 for advice. Who shouldn't take warfarin The following people shouldn't take warfarin: pregnant women \u2013 it can affect the development of the baby people with uncontrolled high blood pressure (severe hypertension) people with a high risk of internal bleeding \u2013 for example, those with a stomach ulcer people with a bleeding disorder \u2013 such as haemophilia Side effects of warfarin Bleeding is the main side effect associated with warfarin, as it slows down the blood's normal clotting ability. You're at greatest risk of bleeding in the first few weeks of starting treatment with warfarin and when you're unwell. You should therefore seek medical attention if you: pass blood in your urine or faeces pass black faeces have severe bruising have long nosebleeds \u2013 lasting more than 10 minutes have bleeding gums cough up blood or have blood in your vomit experience unusual headaches have heavy or increased bleeding during your period, or any other bleeding from your vagina (in women) Take extra care to avoid cutting yourself while taking anticoagulant medication because of the risk of excessive bleeding. For example, you should: take care when shaving and brushing your teeth wear protective clothing when gardening, sewing or playing contact sports use insect repellent to avoid insect bites or stings Seek urgent medical attention if you're taking warfarin and you: have a fall or accident experience a significant blow to your head are unable to stop any bleeding have signs of bleeding, such as bruising Skin rashes and hair loss are also common side effects of warfarin. Contact your GP or the healthcare specialist responsible for your care if you experience any persistent side effects while taking warfarin. Interactions Medicines Warfarin can interact with many other medicines. The patient information leaflet that comes with a medicine should tell you if it's safe to take with warfarin. Ask your GP or pharmacist if you're unsure. When taking warfarin: don't take aspirin, or treatments containing aspirin, unless it's prescribed by a healthcare professional as it could cause bleeding  don't take ibuprofen unless it's prescribed by a healthcare professional you can take paracetamol, but don't take more than the recommended dose Herbal medicines and supplements can also interact with warfarin. You should therefore avoid taking them without first checking with your GP, pharmacist, or staff at your local anticoagulant clinic. Food and drink Some food and drink can interfere with the effect of warfarin if consumed in large amounts, including foods that are rich in vitamin K. Foods containing large amounts of vitamin K include: green leafy vegetables, such as broccoli and spinach vegetable oils cereal grains Small amounts of vitamin K can also be found in meat and dairy foods. When your first dose of warfarin is prescribed, it doesn't matter how much vitamin K you're eating because the dosage will be based on your current blood clotting levels. However, if you make significant changes to your diet, such as increasing your vitamin K intake or cutting out foods that contain vitamin K, it could interfere with how warfarin works. Consult the healthcare professional responsible for your care before making any significant changes to your diet while taking warfarin. They'll also be able to give you more information about foods to avoid or limit. Alcohol Getting drunk or binge drinking is dangerous while taking warfarin. It may increase the effect of the drug, increasing the risk of bleeding. The latest guidelines on drinking alcohol state that regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week (for both men and women) risks damaging your health. Fourteen units is equivalent to six pints of average-strength beer or 10 small glasses of low-strength wine. Read more about units of alcohol. Heavy drinkers or people with liver disease who are taking warfarin shouldn't drink alcohol. Other useful information Surgery and dental work Because of the risk of bleeding, your dose of warfarin may need to be lowered or stopped a few days before having an operation or dental work. Tell the surgeon or dentist that you're taking warfarin. You should also tell anyone else involved with your care, such as an anticoagulant nurse, if you need an operation so they can make arrangements. Having vaccinations You can have vaccinations while taking warfarin, but all injections must: be given under the skin not be given into the muscle as it may cause bruising  have firm pressure applied to the site for 10 minutes afterwards  Playing sports You can play sports while taking warfarin, but because of the risk of bleeding: contact sports that could lead to a head injury, such as football, rugby, cricket and hockey, are best avoided if played competitively martial arts and kickboxing must be avoided You can continue to take part in non-contact sports, such as running, athletics, cycling and racquet sports. However, make sure you wear protective clothing, such as a cycle helmet. Going on holiday Tell your GP or anticoagulant nurse if you're going on holiday, in this country or abroad, and arrange to have your INR checked before you go. If you're going to be away longer than a month, you may need to arrange to have your INR checked while you're away. Make sure you have enough warfarin tablets to last for the duration of your trip. Body piercings Body piercings aren't recommended while taking warfarin because of the increased risk of bleeding and risk of infection.

They can also be used to treat a number of other conditions, including: obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) generalised anxiety disorder  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)  Antidepressants are also sometimes used to treat people with long-term (chronic) pain. Read more about when antidepressants are used. How antidepressants work It's thought that antidepressants work by increasing levels of a group of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. Certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and noradrenaline, can improve mood and emotion, although this process isn't fully understood. Increasing levels of neurotransmitters can also disrupt pain signals sent by nerves, which may explain why some antidepressants can help relieve long-term pain. While antidepressants can treat the symptoms of depression, they don't always address its causes. This is why they're usually used in combination with therapy to treat more severe depression or other mental health conditions caused by emotional distress. How effective are antidepressants? Most people benefit from taking antidepressants to some degree, but research suggests antidepressants may not be as effective as previously thought in cases of mild depression. However, they're the most effective treatment in relieving symptoms quickly, particularly in cases of severe depression. The Royal College of Psychiatrists estimates that 50-65% of people treated with an antidepressant for depression will see an improvement, compared to 25-30% of those taking inactive \"dummy\" pills (placebo). This means that most people do benefit from antidepressants, even if it's sometimes a result of the placebo effect. Doses and duration of treatment Antidepressants are usually taken in tablet form. When they're prescribed, you'll start on the lowest possible dose thought necessary to improve your symptoms. Antidepressants usually need to be taken for around seven days (without missing a dose) before the benefit is felt. It's important not to stop taking them if you get some mild side effects early on, as these effects usually wear off quickly. If you take an antidepressant for four weeks without feeling any benefit, speak to your GP or mental health specialist. They may recommend increasing your dose or trying an alternative medication. A course of treatment usually lasts for six months, although a two-year course may be recommended for people with a previous history of depression. Some people with recurrent depression may be advised to take them indefinitely. Read more about antidepressant doses. Side effects Different antidepressants can have a range of different side effects. Always check the information leaflet that comes with your medication to see what the possible side effects are. In general, the most common side effects of antidepressants are usually mild. Side effects should improve within a few days or weeks of treatment, as the body gets used to the medication. Read more information about: possible side effects of antidepressants cautions and interactions of antidepressants Different types of antidepressants There are different types of antidepressants. Some of the most widely used types are discussed below. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) SSRIs are the most widely prescribed type of antidepressants. They're usually preferred over other antidepressants, as they cause fewer side effects. An overdose is also less likely to be serious. Fluoxetine is probably the best known SSRI (sold under the brand name Prozac). Other SSRIs include citalopram (Cipramil), paroxetine (Seroxat) and sertraline (Lustral). Serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) SNRIs are similar to SSRIs. They were designed to be a more effective antidepressant than SSRIs. However, the evidence that SNRIs are more effective in treating depression is uncertain. It seems that some people respond better to SSRIs, while others respond better to SNRIs. Examples of SNRIs include duloxetine (Cymbalta and Yentreve) and venlafaxine (Efexor). Noradrenaline and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NASSAs) NASSAs may be effective for some people who are unable to take SSRIs. The side effects of NASSAs are similar to those of SSRIs, but they're thought to cause fewer sexual problems. However, they may also cause more drowsiness at first. The main NASSA prescribed in the UK is mirtazapine (Zispin). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) TCAs are an older type of antidepressant. They're no longer usually recommended as a first-line treatment for depression because they can be more dangerous if an overdose is taken. They also cause more unpleasant side effects than SSRIs and SNRIs. Exceptions are sometimes made for people with severe depression that fail to respond to other treatments. TCAs may also be recommended for other mental health conditions, such as OCD and bipolar disorder. Examples of TCAs include amitriptyline (Tryptizol), clomipramine (Anafranil), imipramine (Tofranil), lofepramine (Gamanil) and nortriptyline (Allegron). Some types of TCAs, such as amitriptyline, can also be used to treat chronic nerve pain. Alternatives to antidepressants Alternative treatments for depression include talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Increasingly, people with moderate to severe depression are treated using a combination of antidepressants and CBT. Antidepressants work quickly in reducing symptoms, whereas CBT takes time to deal with causes of depression and ways of overcoming it. Regular exercise has also been shown to be useful for those with mild depression. Read more about alternatives to antidepressants. Yellow Card Scheme The Yellow Card Scheme allows you to report suspected side effects from any type of medicine you're taking. It's run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). See the Yellow Card Scheme website for more information.

They're mainly prescribed to treat depression, particularly persistent or severe cases, and are often used in combination with a talking therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). SSRIs are usually the first choice medication for depression because they generally have fewer side effects than most other types of antidepressant. As well as depression, SSRIs can be used to treat a number of other mental health conditions, including: generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) panic disorder severe phobias, such as agoraphobia and social phobia bulimia post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) SSRIs can sometimes be used to treat other conditions, such as premature ejaculation, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Occasionally, they may also be prescribed to treat pain. How SSRIs work It's thought that SSRIs work by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter (a messenger chemical that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain). It's thought to have a good influence on mood, emotion and sleep. After carrying a message, serotonin is usually reabsorbed by the nerve cells (known as \"reuptake\"). SSRIs work by blocking (\"inhibiting\") reuptake, meaning more serotonin is available to pass further messages between nearby nerve cells. It would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, but a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms and make people more responsive to other types of treatment, such as CBT. Doses and duration of treatment SSRIs are usually taken in tablet form. When they're prescribed, you'll start on the lowest possible dose thought necessary to improve your symptoms. SSRIs usually need to be taken for two to four weeks before the benefit is felt. You may experience mild side effects early on, but it's important that you don't stop taking the medication. These effects will usually wear off quickly. If you take an SSRI for four to six weeks without feeling any benefit, speak to your GP or mental health specialist. They may recommend increasing your dose or trying an alternative antidepressant. A course of treatment usually lasts for at least six months, although longer courses are sometimes recommended and some people with recurrent problems may be advised to take them indefinitely. Read more about SSRI doses. Things to consider SSRIs aren't suitable for everyone. They're not usually recommended if you're pregnant, breastfeeding or under 18, because there's an increased risk of serious side effects. However, exceptions can be made if the benefits of treatment are thought to outweigh the risks. SSRIs also need to be used with caution if you have certain underlying health problems, including diabetes, epilepsy and kidney disease. Some SSRIs can react unpredictably with other medicines, including some over-the-counter painkillers and herbal remedies, such as St John\u2019s wort. Always read the information leaflet that comes with your SSRI medication to check if there are any medicines you need to avoid. Read more about the cautions and interactions of SSRIs. Side effects Most people will only experience a few mild side effects when taking SSRIs. These can be troublesome at first, but they'll generally improve with time. Common side effects of SSRIs can include: feeling agitated, shaky or anxious feeling or being sick dizziness blurred vision low sex drive difficulty achieving orgasm during sex or masturbation in men, difficulty obtaining or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) You'll usually need to see your doctor every few weeks when you first start taking SSRIs to discuss how well the medication is working. You can also contact your doctor at any point if you experience any troublesome or persistent side effects. Read more about the side effects of SSRIs. Types of SSRIs There are currently seven SSRIs prescribed in the UK: citalopram (Cipramil) dapoxetine (Priligy) escitalopram (Cipralex) fluoxetine (Prozac or Oxactin) fluvoxamine (Faverin) paroxetine (Seroxat) sertraline (Lustral) You can find more information and advice about these SSRIs on the Medicines Complete website.

You may be given an antifungal medicine to treat common fungal infections, such as: ringworm \u2013 a ring-like red rash on the skin of the body or scalp athlete's foot \u2013 which affects the skin on the feet, causing it to become red, flaky and itchy fungal nail infection \u2013 which causes the toenails or fingernails to become thickened, discoloured and sometimes brittle, with pieces of nail breaking off vaginal thrush \u2013 which causes irritation and swelling of the vagina and vulva (the female external sexual organs) some kinds of severe dandruff \u2013 which causes flakes of skin to peel on the head Invasive fungal infections Invasive fungal infections are less common but more serious. They are infections that occur deep inside the body's tissue or in one of the internal organs. Invasive fungal infections can affect the: lungs \u2013 for example, aspergillosis, where a fungus called aspergillus infects the lining of the lungs brain \u2013 for example, fungal meningitis, where a fungus infects the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord People with a weakened immune system (the body's natural defence system) are particularly vulnerable to invasive fungal infections. Those at risk include: people with HIV and AIDS people having high-dose chemotherapy to treat cancer people who are taking medicines to suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids; in particular, people who have had an organ transplant will be taking immunosuppressants, making them more vulnerable to fungal infections How antifungal medicines work Antifungal medicines work by either: killing the fungal cells \u2013 for example, by affecting a substance in the cell walls, causing the contents of the fungal cells to leak out and the cells to die preventing the fungal cells from growing and reproducing Types of antifungal medicines Antifungal medicines are used in several ways, depending on your specific fungal infection. The main types of antifungal medicines include: topical antifungals \u2013 applied directly to the skin, hair or nails oral antifungals \u2013 which are swallowed in capsule, pill or liquid form intravenous antifungals \u2013 which are injected into your bloodstream intravaginal antifungal pessaries \u2013 small, soft tablets inserted into the vagina to treat conditions such as vaginal thrush Commonly used antifungal medicines There are many different types of antifungal medicines, and you may be familiar with some of the advertised brand names. Many of these brands will contain the same generic antifungal ingredients (alone or in combination). Some of the most common include: clotrimazole econazole miconazole terbinafine fluconazole ketoconazole  amphotericin The packaging should say which antifungal medicine the product contains. It should also say how strong the antifungal medicine is, usually shown as a percentage of the product or in milligrams \u2013 for example, \"cream containing 1% clotrimazole\" or \"capsules containing 50mg of fluconazole\". Getting the right dose of antifungal treatment Your GP or pharmacist should advise on how to take or use your antifungal medicine. The patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine will also contain advice on using your medicine. Speak to your GP or pharmacist if you take too much of your antifungal medicine. You may be advised to visit your nearest hospital's accident and emergency (A&E) department. If you are advised to go to hospital, take the medicine's packaging with you so the healthcare professionals who treat you know what you have taken. Antifungal medicines for children Some antifungal medicines can be used on children and babies. For example, miconazole oral gel can be used to treat oral thrush in babies. Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it's suitable for children, or ask your pharmacy. Different doses are usually needed for children of different ages. Taking antifungal drugs Before taking antifungal medicines, you should consider: any existing conditions or allergies that may affect your treatment for fungal infection the possible side effects of antifungal medicines how an antifungal medicine may interact with other medicines you may be taking (known as drug interactions) You can discuss allergies, side effects and your existing health problems with the pharmacist dispensing your medicine or, if applicable, the doctor who prescribed it. A white blood cell destroying a thrush fungus. Antifungal medicines are used to treat fungal infections such as thrush  Why do we get fungal infections? Fungi are small organisms that feed by breaking down living or dead tissue. The fungi that most commonly cause infections in humans are particularly attracted to a tough, waterproof type of tissue called keratin, which is present in skin, hair and nails. They are known as dermatophytes. Antifungal medicines for children Some antifungal medicines can be used on children and babies \u2013 for example, miconazole can be used to treat oral thrush in babies.

Although antihistamines can't cure these conditions, they often provide relief from symptoms. For example, antihistamines may be used to treat: hay fever  allergic rhinitis \u2013 inflammation of the nose caused by an allergic reaction to substances such as dust mites allergic skin conditions, such as eczema or urticaria (hives) allergic conjunctivitis \u2013 inflammation of the eyes allergic reactions caused by insect bites or stings mild or moderate allergic reactions caused by food allergies \u2013 more severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) usually require emergency treatment with adrenaline Antihistamines also have a number of other uses, such as treating stomach ulcers, insomnia (problems falling asleep) and motion sickness. Antihistamines are available as tablet or capsules (oral antihistamines) creams, lotions and gels (topical antihistamines) a nasal spray Many antihistamines are available over the counter at a pharmacy, although some require a prescription. How antihistamines work Antihistamines work by altering the way cells are affected by a substance called histamine. Histamine is a chemical the immune system uses to help protect the body's cells against infection. Usually histamine is a useful substance, but if you're having an allergic reaction it's sometimes necessary to block its effects. Allergic reactions occur when your immune system mistakes a harmless substance, such as pollen, for a threat. Read more about how antihistamines work. Types of antihistamine and their effects Antihistamine medicines are classified in three groups. These are: first-generation antihistamines \u2013 which cause drowsiness in most people and include diphenhydramine and chlorphenamine  second- or third-generation antihistamines \u2013 which are less likely to cause drowsiness and include loratadine and cetirizine Second- or third-generation antihistamines are usually recommended. Don't underestimate the levels of drowsiness caused by first-generation antihistamines \u2013 their effects can continue into the next day if you take them at night. An exception to this is sometimes made if the drowsiness caused by first-generation antihistamines can be beneficial, for example in cases where itchy skin may be causing sleep problems. Read more about the side effects of antihistamines. Safety Even though most antihistamines are available without a prescription, you shouldn't assume they're safe for everyone to take. Antihistamines may have dangerous and unpredictable effects if taken by people with certain conditions or if combined with certain other substances, such as alcohol or certain antidepressants. It's also important to only take antihistamines as directed. Overdoses are possible and overuse can lead to you becoming reliant on the sedating effects. Before taking antihistamines, always read the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine to check the safety information.

They're often used to relieve symptoms of headaches, painful periods, sprains and strains, colds and flu, arthritis, and other causes of long-term pain. Although NSAIDs are commonly used, they're not suitable for everyone and can sometimes cause troublesome side effects. This information is a general overview of NSAIDs. For information about a specific medicine, you can look up your medication on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) website. This page covers: Types of NSAIDs Who can take NSAIDs Side effects of NSAIDs Interactions with other medicines Food and alcohol Overdoses of NSAIDs Alternatives to NSAIDs Types of NSAIDs NSAIDs are available as tablets, capsules, suppositories (capsules inserted into the bottom), creams, gels and injections. Some can be bought over the counter from pharmacies, while others need a prescription. The main types of NSAIDs include: ibuprofen naproxen diclofenac celecoxib mefenamic acid etoricoxib indometacin high-dose aspirin \u2013 low-dose aspirin isn't normally considered an NSAID NSAIDs may be sold under these names or a brand name. They're all similarly effective, although you may find a particular one works best for you. Who can take NSAIDs? Most people can take NSAIDs, but some people need to be careful about taking them. It's a good idea to ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice before taking an NSAID if you: are over 65 years of age are pregnant or trying for a baby are breastfeeding have asthma have had an allergic reaction to NSAIDs in the past have had stomach ulcers in the past have any problems with your heart, liver, kidneys, blood pressure, circulation, or bowels are taking other medications \u2013 see interactions with other medicines are looking for medication for a child under 16 \u2013 any medication that contains aspirin should not be given to children under 16 NSAIDs might not necessarily need to be avoided in these cases, but they should only be used on the advice of a healthcare professional as there may be a higher risk of side effects. If NSAIDs aren't suitable, your pharmacist or doctor may suggest alternatives to NSAIDs, such as paracetamol. Side effects of NSAIDs Like all medications, there's a risk of side effects from NSAIDs. These tend to be more common if you're taking high doses for a long time, or you're elderly or in poor general health. Over-the-counter NSAIDs generally have fewer side effects than stronger prescription medicines. Possible side effects of NSAIDs include: indigestion \u2013 including stomach aches, feeling sick and diarrhoea stomach ulcers \u2013 these can cause internal bleeding and anaemia; extra medication, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), may be prescribed to help reduce this risk a hole forming in the wall of your stomach or bowel headaches drowsiness dizziness allergic reactions in rare cases, problems with your liver, kidneys, or heart and circulation, such as heart failure, heart attacks and strokes If you experience any troublesome side effects, stop taking your medicine and tell your doctor. Interactions with other medicines Some NSAIDs can react unpredictably with other medications. This can affect how well either medicine works and increase the risk of side effects. It's particularly important to get medical advice before taking an NSAID if you're already taking: another NSAID low-dose aspirin or warfarin \u2013 medicines used to prevent blood clots ciclosporin \u2013 a medicine used to treat autoimmune conditions such as arthritis or ulcerative colitis diuretics \u2013 medicines sometimes used to treat high blood pressure lithium \u2013 a medicine used to treat bipolar disorder and severe depression methotrexate \u2013 a medicine used to treat rheumatoid arthritis a type of antidepressant medicine called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) If you're not sure whether a medication you're taking can be taken at the same time as an NSAID, check the leaflet that comes with it, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice. Food and alcohol The leaflet that comes with your medicine should say whether you need to avoid any particular foods or drinks. Ask your pharmacist or doctor if you're not sure. For information about a specific medicine, check the A-Z of medicine leaflets on the MHRA website. Generally, you don't need to avoid any specific foods while taking NSAIDs. Tablets or capsules should normally be swallowed with water or food to stop them upsetting your stomach. It's usually safe to drink alcohol while taking NSAIDs, but drinking alcohol excessively during treatment may irritate your stomach. Overdoses of NSAIDs Taking too much of an NSAID can be dangerous. This is known as taking an overdose. Contact your GP or NHS 111 for advice immediately if you take too much of your medicine and you experience problems such as feeling or being sick, an upset stomach, or drowsiness. Call 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else experiences serious effects of an overdose, such as fits (seizures), breathing difficulties, or loss of consciousness. Alternatives to NSAIDs As NSAIDs can cause troublesome side effects, alternatives are often recommended first. The main alternative for pain relief is paracetamol, which is available over the counter and is safe for most people to take. NSAID creams and gels that you rub into your skin may be worth trying first if you have muscle or joint pain in a particular part of your body, as they tend to have fewer side effects than tablets or capsules. Your doctor may also be able to recommend different medicines and therapies depending on the condition you have. For example, physiotherapy may help some people with muscle or joint pain.

This means people with APS are at greater risk of developing conditions such as: deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot that usually develops in the leg arterial thrombosis (a clot in an artery), which can cause a stroke or heart attack blood clots in the brain, leading to problems with balance, mobility, vision, speech and memory Pregnant women with APS also have an increased risk of having a miscarriage, although the exact reasons for this are uncertain. APS doesn't always cause noticeable problems, but some people have general symptoms that can be similar to those of multiple sclerosis (a common condition affecting the central nervous system). Read more about the signs and symptoms of APS. What causes antiphospholipid syndrome? APS is an autoimmune condition. This means the immune system, which usually protects the body from infection and illness, attacks healthy tissue by mistake. In APS, the immune system produces abnormal antibodies called antiphospholipid antibodies. These target proteins attached to fat molecules (phospholipids), which makes the blood more likely to clot. It's not known what causes the immune system to produce abnormal antibodies. As with other autoimmune conditions, genetic, hormonal and environmental factors are thought to play a part. Read more about the causes of APS. Who's affected APS can affect people of all ages, including children and babies. However, most people with APS are aged between 20 and 50, and it affects three to five times as many women as men. It's not clear how many people in the UK have the condition. Diagnosing APS Diagnosing APS can sometimes be tricky, as some of the symptoms are similar to multiple sclerosis. Therefore, blood tests to identify the antibodies responsible for APS are essential in diagnosing the condition. Read more about diagnosing APS. How antiphospholipid syndrome is treated Although there's no cure for APS, the risk of developing blood clots can be greatly reduced if it's correctly diagnosed. An anticoagulant medicine such as warfarin or an antiplatelet such as low-dose aspirin is usually prescribed. These reduce the likelihood of unnecessary blood clots forming but still allow clots to form when you cut yourself. Treatment with these medications can also improve a pregnant woman's chance of having a successful pregnancy. With treatment, it's estimated there's about an 80% chance of having a successful pregnancy. Most people respond well to treatment and can lead normal, healthy lives. However, a small number of people with APS continue to experience blood clots despite extensive treatment. Read more about treating APS. Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome In very rare cases, blood clots can suddenly form throughout the body, resulting in multiple organ failure. This is known as catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). CAPS requires immediate emergency treatment in hospital with high-dose anticoagulants. Read more about catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). Information about you If you have APS, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

This means it reduces the risk of blood clots forming. Normally, when there is a cut or break in a small blood vessel, a blood clot forms to plug the hole until the blood vessel heals. Small cells in the blood called platelets cause the blood to clot. When a platelet detects a damaged area of a blood vessel, it produces a chemical that attracts other platelets and makes them stick together to form a blood clot. Clopidogrel reduces the ability of the platelets to stick together and reduces the risk of clots forming. This protects you from having a stroke or heart attack. When is clopidogrel used? You may be given clopidogrel if you have had: a heart attack acute coronary syndrome (minor heart attack or unstable angina) a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) a coronary stent (a device to open up a blocked artery to the heart) an open heart operation peripheral arterial disease a vascular operation Clopidogrel and low-dose aspirin Sometimes, you may be given both low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel. Taken together, they are very effective, but there is a higher risk of bleeding, usually in the gut. This risk increases with age. The key question for your doctor is whether the benefits outweigh the extra risk. This combination treatment is prescribed for a limited period of time, usually up to a maximum of 12 months. After this period, your specialist will usually advise you to stop one of the two antiplatelet medications. Things to consider If you have certain health conditions such as a peptic ulcer or bleeding disorder you should not take clopidogrel, unless advised by a specialist. You should use clopidogrel with caution if you have liver or kidney problems. Clopidogrel must not be given to anyone under 16 years old, unless under specialist advice. It's also not recommended if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Read more about things to consider before taking clopidogrel. Side effects Although serious reactions are rare, clopidogrel can cause side effects including indigestion and nausea. Read more about the side effects of clopidogrel. Clopidogrel can also interact with other medicines. Always read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine to check it is safe to take with clopidogrel. If you are unsure, ask your pharmacist or GP. Read more about how clopidogrel interacts with other medication. Missed or extra doses If you forget to take your dose of clopidogrel, take that dose as soon as you remember, then continue to take your course of clopidogrel as normal. However, if it's almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. If you have to take two doses closer together than normal, there is an increased risk of side effects. The patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine should also give you advice about what to do. If you accidentally take an extra dose or doses of clopidogrel, contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice. Heart attack Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

Antisocial personality disorder is a particularly challenging type of personality disorder, characterised by impulsive, irresponsible and often criminal behaviour. Someone with antisocial personality disorder will typically be manipulative, deceitful and reckless, and won't care for other people's feelings. Like other types of personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder is on a spectrum, which means it can range in severity from occasional bad behaviour to repeatedly breaking the law and committing serious crimes. Psychopaths are considered to have a severe form of antisocial personality disorder. Signs of antisocial personality disorder A person with antisocial personality disorder may: exploit, manipulate or violate the rights of others lack concern, regret or remorse about other people's distress behave irresponsibly and show disregard for normal social behaviour have difficulty sustaining long-term relationships be unable to control their anger lack guilt, or not learn from their mistakes blame others for problems in their lives repeatedly break the law A person with antisocial personality disorder will have a history of conduct disorder during childhood, such as truancy (not going to school), delinquency \u2013 for example, committing crimes or substance misuse \u2013 and other disruptive and aggressive behaviours. Who develops antisocial personality disorder? Antisocial personality disorder affects more men than women. It's not known why some people develop antisocial personality disorder, but both genetics and traumatic childhood experiences, such as child abuse or neglect, are thought to play a role. A person with antisocial personality disorder will have often grown up in difficult family circumstances. One or both parents may misuse alcohol, and parental conflict and harsh, inconsistent parenting are common. As a result of these problems, social services may become involved with the child's care. These types of difficulties in childhood will often lead to behavioural problems during adolescence and adulthood. Effects of antisocial personality disorder Criminal behaviour is a key feature of antisocial personality disorder, and there's a high risk that someone with the disorder will commit crimes and be imprisoned at some point in their life. Men with antisocial personality disorder have been found to be three to five times more likely to misuse alcohol and drugs than those without the disorder, and have an increased risk of dying prematurely as a result of reckless behaviour or attempting suicide. People with antisocial personality disorder are also more likely to have relationship problems during adulthood and be unemployed and homeless. Diagnosing antisocial personality disorder To be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, a person must have a history of conduct disorder before the age of 15. Antisocial personality disorder is diagnosed after rigorous psychological assessment. A diagnosis can only be made if the person is aged 18 years or older and at least three of the following criteria apply: repeatedly breaking the law repeatedly being deceitful being impulsive or incapable of planning ahead being irritable and aggressive having a reckless disregard for their safety or the safety of others being consistently irresponsible lack of remorse These signs must not be part of a schizophrenic or manic episode \u2013 they must be part of the person's everyday personality. This behaviour usually becomes most extreme and challenging during the late teens and early 20s. It may improve by the time the person reaches their 40s. Treating antisocial personality disorder In the past, antisocial personality disorder was thought to be a lifelong disorder, but that's not always the case and it can sometimes be managed and treated. Evidence suggests that behaviour can improve over time with therapy, even if core characteristics such as lack of empathy remain.  However, antisocial personality disorder is one of the most difficult types of personality disorders to treat. A person with antisocial personality disorder may also be reluctant to seek treatment and may only start therapy when ordered to do so by a court. The recommended treatment for someone with antisocial personality disorder will depend on their circumstances, taking into account factors such as age, offending history and whether there are any associated problems, such as alcohol or drug misuse. The person's family and friends will often play an active role in making decisions about their treatment and care. In some cases, substance misuse services and social care may also need to be involved. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published guidelines about the management and prevention of antisocial personality disorder. Talking therapies Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is sometimes used to treat antisocial personality disorder. It's a talking therapy that aims to help a person manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave. Mentalisation-based therapy (MBT) is another type of talking therapy that's becoming more popular in the treatment of antisocial personality disorder. The therapist will encourage the person to consider the way they think and how their mental state affects their behaviour. Democratic therapeutic communities (DTC) Evidence suggests community-based programmes can be an effective long-term treatment method for people with antisocial personality disorder, and is becoming increasingly popular in prisons. DTC is a type of social therapy that aims to address the person's risk of offending, as well as their emotional and psychological needs. It's based around large and small therapy groups and focuses on community issues, creating an environment where both staff and prisoners contribute to the decisions of the community. There may also be opportunities for educational and vocational work. The recommended length of treatment is 18 months as there needs to be enough time for a person to make changes and put new skills into practice. Self-motivation is another important factor for acceptance on to this type of scheme. For example, the person must be willing to work as part of a community, participate in groups and be subject to the democratic process. The Ministry of Justice has more information about DTC in their guide Working with personality disordered offenders (PDF, 969kb). Medication There's little evidence to support the use of medication for treating antisocial personality disorder, although certain antipsychotic and antidepressant medications may be helpful in some instances. Carbamazepine and lithium may help control symptoms such as aggression and impulsive behaviour, and a class of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may improve anger and general personality disorder symptoms. About personality disorders Personality disorders affect how someone thinks, perceives, feels or relates to others. They range from mild to severe. The signs typically emerge in adolescence and persist into adulthood. People with personality disorders often have other mental health problems, particularly depression and substance misuse. Personality disorders may be associated with genetic and family factors, and experiences of distress or fear during childhood, such as neglect or abuse, are common. Although personality disorders may run in families, psychopathy is thought to have a higher genetic component. Treatment for personality disorders usually involves a course of psychological therapy.

But for some people, health worries become overwhelming and a problem in itself. Hypochondria (health anxiety) is excessive worrying about your health, to the point where it causes great distress and affects your everyday life. Some people with health anxiety have a medical condition, which they worry about excessively. Others have medically unexplained symptoms, such as chest pain or headaches, which they are concerned may be a sign of a serious illness, despite the doctor's reassurance. Others may be permanently anxious about their future health, worrying about things like: \"What if I get cancer or heart disease?\" What causes health anxiety? There are many reasons why someone worries too much about their health. You may be going through a particularly stressful period of your life. There may have been illness or death in your family, or another family member may have worried a lot about your health when you were young. Personality can be a factor. You may be vulnerable to health anxiety because you are a worrier generally. You may find it difficult to handle emotions and conflict, and tend to \"catastrophise\" when faced with problems in your life. Sometimes, health anxiety can be a symptom of a mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety disorder, which needs recognising and treating in its own right (see below). Types of health anxiety People with health anxiety can fall into one of two extremes: Constantly seeking information and reassurance \u2013 for example, obsessively researching illnesses from the internet, booking frequent GP appointments, and having frequent tests that don't find any problems. Avoidant behaviour \u2013 avoiding medical TV programmes, GP appointments and anything else that might trigger the anxiety, and avoiding activities such as exercise that are perceived to make the condition worse. Neither of these behaviours are helpful, and need addressing if you are to break the vicious circle of health anxiety. Health anxiety can be a vicious circle If you constantly check your body for signs of illness, such as a rash or bump, you will eventually find something. It often won't be anything serious \u2013 it could be a natural body change, or you could be misinterpreting signs of anxiety (such as increased heart rate and sweating) as signs of a serious condition. However, the discovery tends to cause great anxiety and make you self-check even more. You may find yourself needing more reassurance from doctors, friends and family. The comfort you get from this reassurance may be short-lived, or you may stop believing it, which only means you need more of it to feel better. Seeking reassurance just keeps the symptoms in your head, and usually makes you feel worse. When physical symptoms are triggered or made worse by worrying, it causes even more anxiety, which just worsens the symptoms. Excessive worrying can also lead to panic attacks or even depression. Have I got health anxiety? If you can answer \"yes\" to most of the following questions, it's likely that you are affected by health anxiety and might benefit from talking to your GP. During the past six months: Have you been preoccupied with having a serious illness because of body symptoms, which has lasted at least six months? Have you felt distressed due to this preoccupation? Have you found that this preoccupation impacts negatively on all areas of life, including family life, social life and work? Have you needed to carry out constant self-examination and self-diagnosis? Have you experienced disbelief over a diagnosis from a doctor, or felt you are unconvinced by your doctor's reassurances that you are fine? Do you constantly need reassurance from doctors, family and friends that you are fine, even if you don't really believe what you are being told? How your GP can help Once your GP has established that you do suffer from health anxiety, and there is no serious underlying physical cause for any symptoms you might have, they should investigate whether you might have a problem, such as depression or anxiety disorder, that may be causing or worsening your symptoms.  If this is the case, you may be referred for psychological therapy and you may benefit from antidepressants (see below). If this is not the case, the aim should still be to help you become less worried about your health. You may find that your GP's advice and self-help resources (see below) are all you need to start feeling better, or you may still benefit from a referral for psychological therapy. Psychological therapy Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for many people with health anxiety. It involves working with a trained CBT therapist to identify the thoughts and emotions you experience and the things you do to cope with them, with the aim of changing unhealthy thoughts and behaviours that maintain health anxiety. CBT looks at how to challenge the way you interpret symptoms, to encourage a more balanced and realistic view. It should help you to: learn what seems to make the symptoms worse develop methods of coping with the symptoms keep yourself more active, even if you still have symptoms However, CBT is not the best treatment for everyone with health anxiety. Some people may benefit more from a different psychological therapy, such as trauma-focused therapy or a psychotherapy that will help a particular psychological condition. Accurate assessment is needed to select the right treatment for you and for your problem, so, if necessary, you may be referred to a mental health specialist for this next step.  Medication Antidepressants may be helpful if you have a mental health condition such as depression. For some people, these may work better than CBT. Your GP can directly prescribe antidepressants or refer you to a mental health specialist for treatment. However, treating your symptoms with medication is not always the answer and the possible benefits of medication always need to be weighed against the potential negative effects. Helping yourself There's lots you can do to help yourself. A good first step would be to read the NHS Health Anxiety leaflet, which can be downloaded from the Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS website. This is just one of many self-help guides available. It provides advice and exercises you can try yourself, such as keeping a diary of your preoccupations and symptoms, and counteracting them with realistic and rational thinking.

Anxiety is a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear \u2013 it's an understandable reaction in children to change or a stressful event. But for some children, anxiety affects their behaviour and thoughts on a daily basis, interfering with their school, home and social life. This is when you may need professional help to tackle it before it becomes a more serious issue. So how do you know when your child's anxiety has reached this stage? Read on to find out: What are the signs of anxiety in children?  What types of anxiety do children and teenagers experience?  When is anxiety a disorder that needs treating? How serious can it be?  Where should I go for help? How can an anxiety disorder be treated? What can I do to help my child? Why are some children affected and others not? How common are anxiety disorders in children? Where can I go for further information and support? What are the signs of anxiety in children? Anxiety can make a child feel scared, panicky, embarrassed or ashamed. Some of the signs to look out for in your child are: finding it hard to concentrate not sleeping, or waking in the night with bad dreams not eating properly quickly getting angry or irritable, and being out of control during outbursts constantly worrying or having negative thoughts feeling tense and fidgety, or using the toilet often always crying being clingy all the time (when other children are ok) complaining of tummy aches and feeling unwell Your child may not be old enough to recognise why they're feeling this way. The reason for the anxiety (if there is one) will differ depending on the age of the child. Separation anxiety is common in younger children, whereas older children and teenagers tend to worry more about school performance, relationships or health. What types of anxiety do children and teenagers experience? Common types of anxiety in children and teenagers are described below. A fear or phobia about something specific Children are commonly afraid of things like monsters, dogs or water. This is a perfectly normal part of growing up, but has the potential to become a phobia (a type of anxiety disorder) when the fear becomes overwhelming and affects your child's day-to-day life. Read about phobias.  Feeling anxious for most of the time for no apparent reason While it's normal for children to frequently have fears and worries, some anxious children may grow up to develop a long-term condition called generalised anxiety disorder when they become a teenager or young adult. Generalised anxiety disorder causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event. People affected by it feel anxious most days and often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed. Read more about generalised anxiety disorder. Separation anxiety  Separation anxiety means a child worrying about not being with their parent or regular carer. It is common in young children, and normally develops at about six months of age. It can make settling into nursery or school or with a child minder very difficult. Separation anxiety in older children may be a sign that they\u2019re feeling insecure about something \u2013 they could be reacting to changes at home, for example. Social anxiety Social anxiety is not wanting to go out in public, see friends or take part in activities. Social 'shyness' is perfectly normal for some children and teenagers, but it becomes a problem \u2013 'social anxiety disorder' \u2013 when everyday activities like shopping or speaking on the phone cause intense, overwhelming fear. Children affected by it tend to fear doing or saying something they think will be humiliating. Social anxiety disorder tends to affect older children who have gone through puberty. Read more about social anxiety disorder. School-based anxiety Some children become anxious about going to school, schoolwork, friendships or bullying, especially if they're changing school or moving up a level. They may not always share these worries with you, and instead complain of tummy aches or feeling sick. One of the signs is crying or seeming tired in the morning.  This may be a problem that needs tackling if it is significantly affecting their daily life (see below). Less common anxiety disorders Post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder are other anxiety disorders that can occasionally affect children, but are usually seen in adults. It's rare for children to have panic attacks. When is anxiety a disorder that needs treating? It is probably time to get professional help for your child's anxiety if: you feel it is not getting better or is getting worse, and efforts to tackle it yourself have not worked you think it's slowing down their development or having a significant effect on their schooling or relationships  it happens very frequently How serious can it be? Long-term anxiety can severely interfere with a child's personal development, family life and schooling. Anxiety disorders that start in childhood often persist into the teenage years and early adulthood. Teenagers with an anxiety disorder are more likely to develop clinical depression, misuse drugs and feel suicidal. This is why you should get help as soon as you realise it's a problem. Where should I go for help? Seeing your GP You can talk to your GP on your own or with your child, or your child might be able to have an appointment without you. The doctor should listen to your concerns and offer some advice about what to do next. Your child may be referred to the local child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS), where the workers are trained to help young people with a wide range of problems. Professionals who work in CAMHS services include psychologists, psychiatrists and psychotherapists. They should offer help and support to parents and carers as well as the child. Learn more about CAMHS. Youth counselling services  If your child doesn't want to see a doctor, they may be able to get help from a local youth counselling service. Youth counselling services are specially set up for young people to talk about what\u2019s worrying them, and get advice. For more information, visit Youth Access, the largest provider of young people's advice and counselling services in the UK. Telephone or online help Telephone helplines or online services can be helpful for children and young people, who may feel it's easier to talk to someone who doesn\u2019t know them. See Where can I go for further information and support? How can an anxiety disorder be treated? The type of treatment offered will depend on what is causing your child's anxiety. Counselling It can be helpful for your child to talk in confidence about what is worrying them to a trained person, especially as it's someone they don't know. If your child is being seen at CAMHS, they might see a child and adolescent psychotherapist or a clinical psychologist. If they are at a youth counselling service, it will be a trained youth counsellor or psychotherapist. These sessions can help them work out what is making them anxious and how they can work through the situation. Cognitive behavioural therapy Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help your child manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave. It has been proven to help with anxiety that isn't severe, and is commonly offered to young people who are anxious. Your child will work with the therapist to find ways to change the way they think and find strategies for coping in situations that make them anxious. They'll usually have 9-20 sessions. It's not clear whether CBT is effective for children younger than six years of age. Learn more about CBT. Medication If your child's anxiety problem has not got better, your doctor may talk to you about trying medication. A type of antidepressant, called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), may help your child feel calmer and differently about things. Antidepressants usually take around two to four weeks to work properly, so you or your child may not notice the difference immediately. It's natural to be concerned about side effects. Your child should be aware of any possible adverse effects and should tell you or their doctor if they happen. Read more about SSRIs. What can I do to help my child? If a child is experiencing anxiety, there is plenty parents and carers can do to help. First, it's important to talk to your child about their anxiety or worries. Read our advice on How to help your anxious child. Why are some children affected and others not? Genes and personality Some children are simply born more nervous and anxious and less able to cope with stress than other children. A child's anxious personality may be partly determined by the genes they've inherited from their parents. Parents of anxious children may recognise the signs and remember feeling and behaving the same when they were younger. Stressful environment Children can pick up anxious behaviour from being around anxious people. If you're worried that your child might be influenced by our own behaviour, you might want to listen to these podcasts offering advice about anxiety and worry and explaining how you can take control of your anxiety. Some children can also develop anxiety after a series of stressful events. They may be able to cope with one of these events, but several difficult events together may be too much for them to cope with. Examples are: Frequently moving house and school \u2013 it can be hard to settle when you're always expecting change Divorce or separation of parents, especially when there are new step parents and siblings (although many children will adapt to this and settle in time) Parents fighting or arguing Death of a close relative or friend Becoming seriously ill or injured in an accident Having someone in the family who is ill or disabled School-related issues such as homework or exams, or bullying or friendship problems Becoming involved in crime Being abused or neglected Medical conditions Children with certain conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autistic spectrum disorders may experience anxiety as part of the symptoms of their condition, because of differences in the way their brain functions. How common are anxiety disorders in children? Nearly 300,000 young people in Britain have an anxiety disorder.  In the UK, anxiety disorders are estimated to affect 5-19% of all children and adolescents, and about 2-5% of children younger than 12. Separation anxiety is the most common anxiety disorder in children younger than 12. Where can I go for further information and support?

But if your child\u2019s anxiety is starting to affect their wellbeing, they may need some help to overcome it. What makes children anxious? Children tend to feel anxious about different things at different ages. Many of these worries are a normal part of growing up. From about eight months to three years, for example, it\u2019s very common for young children to have something called separation anxiety. They may become clingy and cry when separated from their parents or carers. This is a normal stage in children\u2019s development and tends to ease off at around age two to three. It\u2019s also common for pre-school children to develop specific fears or phobias. Common fears in early childhood include animals, insects, storms, heights, water, blood, and the dark. These fears usually go away gradually on their own. Throughout a child\u2019s life there will be other times when they feel anxiety. Lots of children feel anxious when going to a new school, for example, or before tests and exams. Some children feel shy in social situations and may need support with this. When is anxiety a problem for children? Anxiety becomes a problem for children when it starts to get in the way of their day-to-day life. \u201CWe all get anxious at times, but some children seem to live a life of anxiety, where it\u2019s not short-term and it\u2019s not just an occasional thing,\u201D says Paul Stallard, Professor of Child and Family Mental Health at the University of Bath. \u201CIf you go into any school at exam time all the kids will be anxious but some may be so anxious that they don\u2019t get into school that morning,\u201D says Professor Stallard. \u201CSome will sit in an exam and their mind freezes and they can\u2019t get anything down on paper. This is when anxiety starts to interfere with what children need to do or would like to do in everyday life.\u201D Severe anxiety like this can harm children\u2019s mental and emotional wellbeing, affecting their self-esteem and confidence. They may become withdrawn and go to great lengths to avoid things or situations that make them feel anxious. What are the signs of anxiety in children? When young children feel anxious, they cannot always understand or express what they are feeling. You may notice that they become irritable, tearful, clingy or have difficulty sleeping. They may wake in the night, start wetting the bed or have bad dreams. In older children you may notice that they: lack the confidence to try new things or seem unable to face simple, everyday challenges find it hard to concentrate have problems with sleeping or eating are prone to angry outbursts have negative thoughts going round and round their head, or keep thinking that bad things are going to happen start avoiding everyday activities, such as seeing friends, going out in public or attending school See more about the physical symptoms of anxiety. Why is my child anxious? Some children are more prone to worries and anxiety than others. Children often find change difficult and may become anxious following a house move or when starting a new school. Children who have had a distressing or traumatic experience, such as a car accident or house fire, may suffer with anxiety afterwards. Family arguments and conflict can also leave children feeling insecure and anxious. Teenagers are more likely to suffer with social anxiety than other age groups, avoiding social gatherings or making excuses to get out of them. \u201CAt this age, the good opinion of your peer group is essential,\u201D says Professor Stallard. \u201CThe fear is that, if you don\u2019t like the same music or clothes, you will stand out as different and might be ridiculed or not accepted.\u201D Read more about social anxiety. How to help your anxious child If a child is experiencing anxiety, there is plenty parents and carers can do to help. First and foremost, it\u2019s important to talk to your child about their anxiety or worries. Reassure them and show them you understand how they feel. If your child is old enough, it may help to explain what anxiety is and the physical effects it has on our bodies. It may be helpful to describe anxiety as being like a wave that builds up and then ebbs away again. As well as talking to your child about their worries and anxieties, it\u2019s important to help them find solutions, says Professor Stallard. \u201CNo one likes to see their child anxious and the tendency is to say, if you\u2019re worried about that sleepover, don\u2019t go. But what you\u2019re doing is saying, if you get anxious about something, it means you can\u2019t do it. \u201CIt\u2019s more helpful to say,\u2019 I hear that you\u2019re worried about this. What can you do that\u2019s going to help?\u2019,\u201D says Professor Stallard. \u201CFocus on exploring solutions with your child, instead of just rehearsing their worries and talking about all the things that could go wrong. Acknowledge your child\u2019s worries, but then help them plan ways to cope with them.\u201D With younger children you can work together to develop these skills and strategies. \u201CFor example, you could say, \u2018I\u2019ll take you to the party, knock on the door and talk to the mum or dad, then you can give your friend their present\u2019,\u201D says Professor Stallard. \u201CBut as children get older they have to learn these skills and strategies themselves. People can\u2019t be there to sort them out all the time.\u201D Other ways to ease anxiety in children Teach your child to recognise signs of anxiety in themselves and to ask for help when it strikes. Children of all ages find regular routines reassuring so, if your child is feeling anxious, try to stick to regular daily routines where possible. If your child is anxious because of distressing events, such as a bereavement or separation, see if you can find books or films that will help them understand their feelings. If you know a change, such as a house move is coming up, prepare your child by talking to them about what is going to happen and why. Try not to become anxious yourself or overprotective \u2013 rather than doing things for your child or helping them to avoid anxiety provoking situations, encourage your child to find ways to manage them. Practice simple relaxation techniques with your child, such as taking three deep, slow breaths, breathing in for a count of three and out for three. You\u2019ll find more relaxation techniques for children on the Moodcafe website. Distraction can be helpful for young children. For example, if they are anxious about going to nursery, play games on the way there, such as seeing who can spot the most red cars. \u201CThis is a way of focusing attention away from internal anxiety cues and worries to external, more neutral anxiety-reducing things,\u201D says Professor Stallard. Turn an old tissue box into a \u2018worry\u2019 box. Get your child to write down or draw their worries and post them into the box. Then you can sort through the box together at the end of the day or week. When should we get help?  If your child\u2019s anxiety is severe, persists and interferes with their everyday life, it\u2019s a good idea to get some help. Some children do grow out of anxiety but, if it\u2019s not addressed in childhood, it can continue into adulthood. A visit to your GP is a good place to start. If your child\u2019s anxiety is affecting their school life, it\u2019s a good idea to talk to their school as well. Parents and carers can get help and advice around children\u2019s mental health from Young Minds' free parent helpline on 0808 802 5544 (Monday to Friday, 9.30am-4pm).

Everyone has feelings of anxiety at some point in their life \u2013 for example, you may feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam, or having a medical test or job interview. During times like these, feeling anxious can be perfectly normal. However, some people find it hard to control their worries. Their feelings of anxiety are more constant and can often affect their daily lives. Anxiety is the main symptom of several conditions, including: panic disorder phobias \u2013 such as agoraphobia or claustrophobia  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) social anxiety disorder (social phobia) However, the information in this section is about a specific condition called generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is a long-term condition that causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event.  People with GAD feel anxious most days and often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed. As soon as one anxious thought is resolved, another may appear about a different issue. GAD can cause both psychological (mental) and physical symptoms. These vary from person to person, but can include: feeling restless or worried having trouble concentrating or sleeping dizziness or heart palpitations Read about the symptoms of GAD. When to see your GP Although feelings of anxiety at certain times are completely normal, see your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or causing you distress. Your GP will ask about your symptoms and your worries, fears and emotions to find out if you could have GAD. Read more about diagnosing GAD. What causes GAD? The exact cause of GAD isn't fully understood, although it's likely that a combination of several factors plays a role. Research has suggested that these may include: overactivity in areas of the brain involved in emotions and behaviour an imbalance of the brain chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline, which are involved in the control and regulation of mood the genes you inherit from your parents \u2013 you're estimated to be five times more likely to develop GAD if you have a close relative with the condition having a history of stressful or traumatic experiences, such as domestic violence, child abuse or bullying having a painful long-term health condition, such as arthritis having a history of drug or alcohol misuse However, many people develop GAD for no apparent reason. Who is affected? GAD is a common condition, estimated to affect up to 5% of the UK population. Slightly more women are affected than men, and the condition is more common in people from the ages of 35 to 59. How GAD is treated GAD can have a significant effect on your daily life, but several different treatments are available that can ease your symptoms. These include: psychological therapy \u2013 such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) medication \u2013 such as a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) There are also many things you can do yourself to help reduce your anxiety, such as:  going on a self-help course exercising regularly stopping smoking cutting down on the amount of alcohol and caffeine you drink Read how stopping smoking can improve your anxiety. With treatment, many people are able to control their anxiety levels. However, some treatments may need to be continued for a long time and there may be periods when your symptoms worsen.

The aortic valve controls the flow of blood out from the heart to the rest of the body. An aortic valve replacement involves removing a faulty or damaged valve and replacing it with a new one made from synthetic materials or animal tissue. It's a major operation that isn't suitable for everyone and can take a long time to recover from. When is it necessary to replace the aortic valve? The aortic valve may need to be replaced for two reasons: the valve has become narrowed (aortic stenosis) \u2013 the opening of the valve becomes smaller, obstructing the flow of blood out of the heart the valve is leaky (aortic regurgitation) \u2013 the valve allows blood to flow back through into the heart The problems can get worse over time and in severe cases can lead to life-threatening problems such as heart failure, if left untreated. There are no medicines to treat aortic valve problems, so replacing the valve will be recommended if you're at risk of serious complications, but are otherwise well enough to have surgery.  Read more about why aortic valve replacements are carried out. How is an aortic valve replacement carried out? An aortic valve replacement is carried out under general anaesthetic. This means you'll be asleep during the operation and won't feel any pain while it's carried out. During the procedure: a large cut (incision) about 25cm long is made in your chest to access your heart \u2013 although sometimes a smaller cut may be made your heart is stopped and a heart-lung (bypass) machine is used to take over the job of your heart during the operation the damaged or faulty valve is removed and replaced with the new one your heart is restarted and the opening in your chest is closed The operation usually takes a few hours. You'll have a discussion with your doctor or surgeon before the procedure to decide whether a synthetic or animal tissue replacement valve is most suitable for you. Read more about what happens during an aortic valve replacement. Recovering from an aortic valve replacement You'll usually need to stay in hospital for about a week after an aortic valve replacement, although it may be two to three months before you fully recover. You should take things easy when you first get home, but you can start to gradually return to your normal activities over the next few weeks. You'll be given specific advice about any side effects you can expect while you recover and any activities you should avoid.

Risks of an aortic valve replacement An aortic valve replacement is a big operation and, like any type of surgery, carries a risk of complications. Some of the main risks of an aortic valve replacement include: wound, lung, bladder or heart valve infections blood clots strokes a temporarily irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) reduced kidney function for a few days The risk of dying from an aortic valve replacement is around 1-3%, although this risk is much smaller than that of leaving severe aortic valve problems untreated. Most people who survive surgery have a life-expectancy close to normal. Read more about the risks of aortic valve replacement. Alternatives to an aortic valve replacement An aortic valve replacement is the most effective treatment for aortic valve conditions. Alternative procedures are usually only used if open heart surgery is too risky. Possible alternatives include: transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) \u2013 the replacement valve is guided into place through the blood vessels, rather than through a large incision in the chest aortic valve balloon valvuloplasty \u2013 the valve is widened using a balloon sutureless aortic valve replacement \u2013 the valve is not secured using stitches (sutures), to minimise the time spent on a heart-lung machine Read more about the alternatives to an aortic valve replacement.

People with aphasia make mistakes in the words they use, sometimes using the wrong sounds in a word, choosing the wrong word, or putting words together incorrectly. Aphasia also affects speaking and writing in the same way. Many people with the condition find it difficult to understand words and sentences they hear or read. Why does aphasia happen? Aphasia is caused by damage to parts of the brain responsible for understanding and using language. Common causes include: stroke, thought to be the most common cause, around one in three people experience some degree of aphasia after having a stroke severe head injury brain tumour progressive neurological conditions (conditions that over time cause progressive brain and nervous system damage) Read more about the causes of aphasia. Types of aphasia Aphasia is often classified as 'expressive' or 'receptive' aphasia, depending on whether there are difficulties with understanding or expressing language, or both. Symptoms can range from getting a few words mixed up to having difficulty with all forms of communication, such as reading, writing, naming objects and understanding speech. Some people are unaware their speech makes no sense and get frustrated when others don't understand. Read more about the symptoms of aphasia. How is aphasia treated?  A speech and language therapist (SLT) usually diagnoses the condition by testing your language capabilities. They can also help arrange treatment. Speech and language therapy is the main type of treatment for people with aphasia. This aims to help restore some of your ability to communicate and also help you develop alternative ways of communicating, if necessary. You may receive speech and language therapy on an individual basis, or in a group, depending on your needs and the service provided. An increasing number of computer-based applications are available to support people with aphasia. However, it's important to start using these with the assistance of a speech and language therapist. How successful treatment is differs from person to person, but most people with aphasia make some degree of recovery, and some recover fully. Even if aphasia persists, it does not mean a person is unable to live an independent and meaningful life. However, the chances of recovery for people with aphasia related to progressive neurological conditions is poor. This is because there is no way of repairing or preventing the ongoing injury to the brain. When aphasia is caused by a progressive condition, treatment focuses on making the most of what people can still do, and on developing other ways of communicating, to prepare for a time when speaking will be more difficult. Read more about diagnosing aphasia and treating aphasia. Complications The challenges of living with aphasia can impact on how a person feels and interacts with others. In some cases it can led to: isolation anxiety depression If you're concerned about someone with aphasia, encourage them to discuss any problems with their GP or a member of their care team to access the relevant support. If the person is unable to do this themselves, they may require someone to communicate on their behalf. Who is affected? Aphasia is one of the most common communication disorders to affect the brain. Although there are no official figures, the Stroke Association estimates more than 376,000 stroke survivors in the UK are living with aphasia. Aphasia can affect people of all ages, including children. It's most common in people over 65 years old as stroke and common progressive neurological conditions tend to affect older adults. Information about you If you have aphasia, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

The appendix is a small, thin pouch about 5-10cm (2-4 inches) long. It's connected to the large intestine, where stools (faeces) are formed. Nobody knows exactly why we have an appendix, but removing it isn't harmful. Appendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go. Within hours, the pain travels to the lower right-hand side, where the appendix usually lies, and becomes constant and severe. Pressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse. You may lose your appetite, feel sick, and occasionally experience diarrhoea. Read more about the symptoms of appendicitis. When to get medical help If you're experiencing abdominal pain that's gradually getting worse, contact your GP or local out-of-hours service immediately. If these options aren't available, call NHS 111 for advice. You should call 999 for an ambulance if you have sudden pain that continues to get worse and spreads across your abdomen. These are signs your appendix may have burst, which can lead to potentially life-threatening complications. Read more about:  diagnosing appendicitis  complications of appendicitis How appendicitis is treated In most cases of appendicitis, the appendix needs to be surgically removed as soon as possible. Removal of the appendix, known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy, is one of the most common operations in the UK and its success rate is excellent. The operation is most commonly performed as keyhole surgery (laparoscopy), which involves making several small cuts in your abdomen, through which special surgical instruments are inserted. Open surgery, where a larger, single cut is made in the abdomen, is usually carried out if the appendix has burst or access is more difficult. Most people make a full recovery from an appendectomy in a couple of weeks, although strenuous activities may need to be avoided for up to six weeks after open surgery.  Read more about treating appendicitis. What causes appendicitis? It's not exactly clear what the causes of appendicitis are. Most cases are thought to occur when something blocks the entrance of the appendix. For example, a blockage may be formed by a small piece of faeces or an upper respiratory tract infection could lead to a swollen lymph node within the wall of the bowel. This obstruction leads to the development of inflammation and swelling. The pressure caused by the swelling can then lead to the appendix bursting. As the causes aren't fully understood, there's no guaranteed way of preventing appendicitis. Who's affected? Appendicitis is a common condition. Around 40,000 people are admitted to hospital with appendicitis each year in England. It's estimated around 1 in every 13 people develop it at some point in their life. Appendicitis can develop at any age, but it's most common in young people aged from 10 to 20 years old.

There are several stages of severity and a range of associated symptoms. ARLD doesn't usually cause any symptoms until the liver has been severely damaged. When this happens, symptoms can include: feeling sick weight loss loss of appetite yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) swelling in the ankles and tummy confusion or drowsiness vomiting blood or passing blood in your stools This means ARLD is frequently diagnosed during tests for other conditions, or at a stage of advanced liver damage. If you regularly drink alcohol to excess, tell your GP so they can check if your liver is damaged. Read more about: symptoms of ARLD diagnosing ARLD Alcohol and the liver With the exception of the brain, the liver is the most complex organ in the body. Its functions include: filtering toxins from the blood aiding digestion of food regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels helping fight infection and disease The liver is very resilient and capable of regenerating itself. Each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die. The liver can develop new cells, but prolonged alcohol misuse (drinking too much) over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. This can result in serious and permanent damage to your liver. ARLD is very common in the UK \u2013 the number of people with the condition has been increasing over the last few decades as a result of increasing levels of alcohol misuse. Read more about the causes of ARLD. Stages of ARLD There are three main stages of ARLD, although there's often an overlap between each stage. These stages are explained below. Alcoholic fatty liver disease Drinking a large amount of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver. This is called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of ARLD. Fatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, but it's an important warning sign that you're drinking at a harmful level. Fatty liver disease is reversible. If you stop drinking alcohol for two weeks, your liver should return to normal. Alcoholic hepatitis Alcoholic hepatitis \u2013 which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis \u2013 is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. When this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they're damaging their liver through alcohol. Less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drinking). The liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently. Severe alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious and life-threatening illness. Many people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage. Cirrhosis Cirrhosis is a stage of ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred. Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms. It's generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy. A person who has alcohol-related cirrhosis and doesn't stop drinking has a less than 50% chance of living for at least five more years. How ARLD is treated There's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life. This reduces the risk of further damage to your liver and gives it the best chance of recovering. If a person is dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult. However, support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol support services. A liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and doesn't improve when you stop drinking alcohol. You'll only be considered for a liver transplant if you've developed complications of cirrhosis, despite having stopped drinking. All liver transplant units require a person to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of their life. Read more about treating ARLD. Complications Death rates linked to ARLD have risen considerably over the last few decades. Alcohol is now one of the most common causes of death in the UK, along with smoking and high blood pressure. Life-threatening complications of ARLD include: internal (variceal) bleeding build-up of toxins in the brain (encephalopathy) fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) with associated kidney failure liver cancer Read more about the complications of ARLD. Preventing ARLD The most effective way to prevent ARLD is to stop drinking alcohol or stick to the recommended limits: men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over three days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week A unit of alcohol is equal to about half a pint of normal-strength lager or a pub measure (25ml) of spirits. Even if you've been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping your alcohol intake will have important short- and long-term benefits for your liver and overall health.

It can often be managed with rest and over-the-counter painkillers. If your arm has suddenly started hurting but you don't think the cause is serious, try caring for it at home by: holding an ice pack (a pack of frozen peas in a tea towel works well) to your arm for 15-20 minutes every few hours for the first couple of days taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to relieve the pain and any inflammation resting the arm and keeping it raised for as long as possible (try resting it on cushions) to help reduce any swelling and pain See your GP if your arm pain doesn't improve after several days, or if there's increasing redness, swelling or pain. When to get immediate medical help See your GP immediately if: your arm pain is brought on by exercise and relieved with rest; it may be a sign of angina (restricted blood supply to the heart) you think you may have a broken arm (but aren't sure) your arm becomes red, hot and swollen over a period of a few hours, and you start to feel generally unwell and develop a high temperature; you may have an infection   Call 999 for an ambulance if: the pain has come on suddenly and your chest feels like it's being squeezed (you may be having a heart attack or stroke) you have obviously broken your arm (it looks the wrong shape) Read on to get a better idea of what might be wrong with your arm, but don't use this information to diagnose yourself \u2013 always see your GP for a proper diagnosis. Shoulder pain is covered separately. Common causes of arm pain The most common causes of arm pain are: a simple sprain tennis elbow or golfer's elbow bursitis a squashed or trapped nerve angina  repetitive strain injury (RSI) These are discussed below. Simple sprain If you think your pain has been caused by doing more activity than you're used to, you may have just sprained your arm. This means the arm tissues have been stretched, twisted or torn, but aren't permanently damaged. Read about sprains and strains. Avoid exercising the arm and care for it at home using painkillers and an ice pack (see the advice above) until the pain goes away. Tennis elbow or golfer's elbow Tennis elbow and golfer's elbow are conditions that cause pain around the outside or inside of the elbow. They often occur after strenuous overuse of the muscles and tendons near the elbow joint (for example, after playing tennis or golf). The pain caused by tennis elbow or golfer's elbow can last for several weeks or months, but will eventually get better. Bursitis Repetitive movement of the arm can cause a build-up of fluid over the elbow joint, known as olecranon bursitis (the olecranon is the bony tip of the elbow). This results in pain and swelling. Most cases of bursitis can be successfully treated with painkillers at home, but some cases will be complicated by infections and may need antibiotics (this is more common after sustaining a scratch or penetrating injury to the arm). The pain will usually improve within a few weeks, although the swelling may take longer to completely disappear. Squashed or trapped nerve Sometimes, the general \"wear and tear\" that occurs in the joints and bones of the spine as a person gets older can cause the nerves in the spinal cord to become squashed or trapped. This can cause pain that radiates from the neck to the arms, and sometimes also pins and needles. This type of wear and tear is known as spinal arthritis or cervical spondylosis. Arm pain caused by cervical spondylosis varies from person to person, but it's typical to have good days and bad days. In most cases, symptoms can be controlled using over-the-counter medication, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, and exercise.  Read more about treating cervical spondylosis. A trapped nerve can also occur in the arm itself. This can sometimes occur in the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome) or in the elbow (cubital tunnel syndrome). Pain and tingling in your arm and hand that isn't associated with neck pain may be caused by these conditions. Angina Angina is a heart condition caused when the blood supply to the muscles of the heart is restricted. It usually occurs when the arteries supplying the heart become hardened and narrowed. Angina usually causes a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest that can sometimes spread to the left arm, neck, jaw or back. The pain is usually triggered by physical activity or stress and often only lasts for a few minutes. However, sometimes angina may only be felt as pain in the arm. This is why it's important to see your GP as soon as possible if your arm pain comes on after exercise and is relieved with rest. Angina is a serious warning sign that you have an increased risk of more serious conditions, such as a heart attack or stroke. Learn more about the symptoms of angina. Repetitive strain injury Repetitive strain injury may be diagnosed if your arm or elbow pain seems to be caused by a repetitive task and then fades when the task is stopped. It often occurs in people who work with computers or carry out repetitive manual work. Sometimes, the pain is caused by an underlying problem, such as bursitis or tendonitis. Read more about repetitive strain injury. Less common causes of arm pain Less commonly, arm pain may be caused by one of the following conditions or injuries: de Quervain's tenosynovitis \u2013 inflammation of the tendons on the inside of the wrist (read about tendonitis and tenosynovitis) cervical rib \u2013 where you have an extra rib above your normal top rib, which may cause pain, tingling or numbness in the arm inflammation of the nerves in the arm (known as 'brachial and ulnar neuritis') \u2013 this may occur after shingles damage to the nerves connecting the spine and the arm (a 'brachial plexus injury') \u2013 this can be caused by over-stretching the arm or shoulder and most often occurs during contact sports or a motor vehicle accident arthritis of the elbow \u2013 which can cause the elbow joint to become inflamed (swollen, warm and painful) and feel stiff a broken arm, usually caused by a fall onto an outstretched arm Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 18\/09\/2015 Next review due: 18\/09\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Doctors refer to all breaks or cracks in bones as fractures. Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if you think you or your child has broken a bone. If the injury is severe, dial 999 for an ambulance. If it feels like only a minor fracture and it is not an emergency, it may be more appropriate to go to a minor injuries unit. How can I tell if the arm or wrist is broken? A broken arm or wrist bone will be extremely painful and there may also be: swelling or tenderness around the injured area bleeding, if the bone has damaged the tissue and skin These symptoms may also occur if your arm or wrist is sprained rather than broken (read about sprains and strains). An X-ray in hospital is the only way to confirm whether or not the bone is broken. If it's a clean break, you may have heard a snap or a grinding noise during the accident. The bone can break straight across, diagonally, or in a spiral pattern. In severe cases, the bone may break into many pieces (comminuted), stick out at an angle or poke through the skin (open or compound fracture). What you can do It's important not to eat or drink anything if you think you've broken your arm because you may need a general anaesthetic so that the bone can be realigned. Before reaching hospital, a sling may help stabilise the arm (this goes under the arm and around the neck). Avoid trying to straighten the arm. Applying an ice pack, such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel, to the injured area can help reduce pain and swelling. If your child has injured their arm or wrist, try to get someone else to drive so you can support and comfort them. How a broken arm or wrist is treated A broken arm or wrist is usually treated in a hospital accident and emergency department. The treatment differs depending on the severity of the injury. A doctor will give you or your child painkillers and fix a splint to the arm to secure it in position and prevent further damage. An X-ray of the arm will then be taken to see what kind of fracture it is. Even hairline fractures show faintly on X-ray. A simple fracture, where the bone remains aligned, can be treated by applying a plaster cast. This holds the broken ends together so they can heal. You'll be given painkillers to take home and be told how to look after your cast. An appointment will be made to attend a fracture clinic so specialist orthopaedic doctors can take over the care of your fracture. With more severe arm or wrist fractures, the bones can become misaligned (displaced). If the bone isn't realigned (reduced), the bones won't heal well. Doctors use a technique called \"closed reduction\" to pull the bones back into position. Local or regional anaesthetic will be used to numb the arm (this is rarely used in children), or you'll be put to sleep using a general anaesthetic. If doctors are happy with the bones' new position, a plaster cast will be applied and you'll have regular follow-up appointments and X-rays. Certain fractures are best treated with surgery to realign and fix the broken bones. This includes displaced fractures, fractures involving a joint, and open fractures. Surgeons can fix bones with wires, plates, screws or rods. This is called open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Any metalwork isn't usually removed unless it becomes a problem. In rare cases, an external frame, known as an external fixator, is used to hold the broken bones in place. After most types of surgery, a plaster cast is applied to protect the repair. A sling may also be provided for comfort. You'll usually be able to go home within a day or two of having surgery. Recovering from a broken arm or wrist The plaster cast will need to stay on until the bone has healed. The length of time it will take to heal will depend on the type of fracture, whether it's damaged the surrounding tissues, and the person's age. For example, a young child who's cracked their wrist will need to wear a cast or removable splint for just two to three weeks. However, in older people, a wrist injury can take much longer to heal and stiffness is very common. A useful rule of thumb is that the time taken for the bone to regain full strength is usually the same as the time it takes for the fracture to heal. That is, if you\u2019ve been in plaster for six weeks, it will take six weeks to regain full strength. It's important not to get a plaster cast wet. Read more about how should I care for my plaster cast? for further information and advice. The orthopaedic doctors will decide when you can take the cast off and when you can return to work and normal activities. Your arm may be stiff and weak after being in a cast. Physiotherapy can help build strength in the arm muscles and restore full movement. However, it's rarely needed for children. The risk of re-breaking or cracking the bone after the plaster cast is removed is increased, particularly in children. Children should avoid using trampolines, bouncy castles, soft play areas and playing contact sports for a further two to three weeks to minimise this risk. Adults shouldn't drive while their arm is in a cast. Ask your doctor for advice about when you can drive again.

There are four main types, but type 1, called Chiari I, is the most common. In someone with Chiari I, the lowest part of the back of the brain extends into the spinal canal. This can put pressure on the brainstem, spinal cord, and obstruct the flow of fluid. This page focuses on Chiari I malformations. Is it serious? Symptoms Treatments Causes Are Chiari I malformations serious? The severity of Chiari malformations can vary from person to person, but generally: Chiari I malformations aren't considered life-threatening some people experience painful headaches, movement problems and other unpleasant symptoms (see below), but many people won't have any symptoms  there's a chance of developing syringomyelia (where a fluid-filled cavity called a syrinx develops in the spinal cord), which can damage the spinal cord if not treated promptly surgery can usually stop the symptoms getting worse and can sometimes improve them, although some problems may remain Talk to your doctor about what the condition means, what the implications may be for your health and what treatment you may need. Symptoms of Chiari I malformations Many people with a Chiari I malformation will not have any symptoms. Sometimes they're only found after an (MRI) scan of the brain is carried out for another reason. If symptoms do develop, they can include: headaches \u2013 these are usually felt at the back of the head and may be brought on or made worse by coughing, straining, sneezing or bending over neck pain dizziness and balance problems muscle weakness numbness or tingling in the arms or legs blurred vision, double vision and sensitivity to light swallowing problems hearing loss and tinnitus feeling and being sick difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and depression If you develop syringomyelia, you may also experience problems using your hands, difficulty walking, pain, and problems with bladder or bowel control. If you've been diagnosed with a Chiari malformation, you should contact your doctor for advice if you develop any new symptoms or your symptoms worsen. Treatments for Chiari I malformations Treatment for Chiari I malformation depends on whether you have any symptoms and how severe they are. You might not need any treatment if you don't have any symptoms. Painkillers can help relieve any headaches and neck pain. If your headaches are severe or you have problems caused by the pressure on your spinal cord (such as movement difficulties), surgery may be recommended. Surgery The main operation for Chiari malformation is called decompression surgery. Under general anaesthetic a cut is made at the back of your head and the surgeon removes a small piece of bone from the base of your skull. They may also remove a small piece of bone from the top of your spine. This will help reduce the pressure on your brain and allow the fluid in and around your brain and spinal cord to flow normally. Read an NHS leaflet about decompression for Chiari malformation (PDF, 111kb). Other procedures that may be necessary include: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) \u2013 a small hole is made in the wall of one of the cavities of the brain, releasing trapped fluid. See treating hydrocephalus for more information. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting \u2013 a small hole is drilled into the skull and a thin tube called a catheter is passed into the brain cavity to drain trapped fluid and relieve the pressure. See treating hydrocephalus for more information. Untethering \u2013 some children with a type 1 Chiari malformation have a tethered spinal cord, which means it is abnormally attached within the spine. Untethering involves separating the spinal cord and releasing tension in the spine. Read an NHS leaflet on tethered spinal cord (PDF, 193kb). Spinal fixation \u2013 some people with Chiari I will have a hypermobility syndrome, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and may require surgery to stabilise their spine. The aim of surgery is to stop existing symptoms getting any worse. Some people also experience an improvement in their symptoms, particularly their headaches. However, surgery sometimes results in no improvement or symptoms getting worse. There's also a small risk of serious complications, such as paralysis or a stroke. Talk to your surgeon about the different surgical options and what the benefits and risks of each are. Causes of Chiari I malformations The exact cause of Chiari I malformations is unknown. It tends to be present from birth, but is normally only found in adulthood when symptoms develop or when an MRI scan is done. Many cases are thought to be the result of part of the skull not being large enough for the brain. Chiari I malformations can also develop in people with a tethered spinal cord, a build-up of fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus), and some types of brain tumour. Chiari malformations can sometimes run in families. It's possible that some children born with it may have inherited a faulty gene that caused problems with their skull development. But the risk of passing a Chiari malformation on to your child is very small. And remember: even if your children do inherit it, they may not experience symptoms. Information about you If you have been affected by a Chiari malformation, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Most people with an abnormal heart rhythm can lead a normal life if it is properly diagnosed. The main types of arrhythmia are: atrial fibrillation (AF) \u2013 this is the most common type, where the heart beats irregularly and faster than normal supraventricular tachycardia \u2013 episodes of abnormally fast heart rate at rest bradycardia \u2013 the heart beats more slowly than normal heart block \u2013 the heart beats more slowly than normal and can cause people to collapse ventricular fibrillation \u2013 a rare, rapid and disorganised rhythm of heartbeats that rapidly leads to loss of consciousness and sudden death if not treated immediately Arrhythmias can affect all age groups, but atrial fibrillation is more common in older people. Drinking alcohol in excess or being overweight increases your likelihood of developing atrial fibrillation. You may also be at risk of developing an arrhythmia if your heart tissue is damaged because of an illness \u2013 for example, if you have had a heart attack or have heart failure. Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of stroke. Having atrial fibrillation means your risk of stroke is five times higher than for someone whose heart rhythm is normal. Certain types of arrhythmia occur in people with severe heart conditions, and can cause sudden cardiac death. This kills 100,000 people in the UK every year. Some of these deaths could be avoided if the arrhythmias were diagnosed earlier. Common triggers for an arrhythmia are viral illnesses, alcohol, tobacco, changes in posture, exercise, drinks containing caffeine, and certain over-the-counter, prescribed and illegal recreational drugs. How do you lower your risk of an arrhythmia? It is not always possible to prevent an arrhythmia developing, although a healthy lifestyle can lower your risk of developing a heart condition. Treatment aims to prevent future episodes. You can also make lifestyle changes so you avoid some of the triggers for your heart rhythm problem. Your heart's electrical system The heart's rhythm is controlled by electrical signals. An arrhythmia is an abnormality of the heart's rhythm. It may beat too slowly, too quickly, or irregularly. These abnormalities range from a minor inconvenience or discomfort to a potentially fatal problem. Could you have an arrhythmia? Symptoms of arrhythmias include palpitations, feeling dizzy, fainting and being short of breath, although having these symptoms does not always mean you have a heart rhythm problem. Arrhythmia Alliance's heart rhythm checklist can help you gather information to discuss with your GP if you have any of these symptoms. Diagnosing arrhythmias If your symptoms persist or there's a history of unexplained sudden death in your family, it's important for your GP to refer you to a heart specialist (a cardiologist or electrophysiologist who specialises in heart rhythm disorders). The most effective way to diagnose an arrhythmia is with an electrical recording of your heart rhythm called an electrocardiogram (ECG). If the ECG doesn't find a problem, you may need further monitoring of your heart. This may involve wearing a small portable ECG recording device for 24 hours or longer. This is called a Holter monitor or ambulatory ECG monitoring. If your symptoms seem to be triggered by exercise, an exercise ECG may be needed to record your heart rhythm while you are using a treadmill or exercise bike. You should request a copy of your ECG. Take it with you to see the cardiologist or heart rhythm specialist and always keep a copy for future use. Other tests used in diagnosing arrhythmias include: cardiac event recorder \u2013 a device to record occasional symptoms over a period of time whenever you have them electrophysiological (EP) study \u2013 a test to locate problems with the electrical signals in your heart by passing soft wires up a vein in your leg and into your heart while you are sedated echocardiogram (echo) \u2013 an ultrasound scan of your heart Treatment for arrhythmias How your arrhythmia will be treated will depend on whether it is a fast or slow arrhythmia or heart block. Any underlying causes of your arrhythmia, such as heart failure, will need to be treated as well. The treatments used for arrhythmias include: medication \u2013 to stop or prevent an arrhythmia or control the rate of an arrhythmia cardioversion \u2013 a treatment that uses electricity to shock the heart back into a normal rhythm while you are anaesthetised or sedated catheter ablation \u2013 a keyhole treatment under local or general anaesthetic that carefully destroys the diseased tissue in your heart that causes the arrhythmia pacemaker \u2013 a small device containing its own battery that is implanted in your chest under local anaesthetic; it produces electrical signals to do the work of the natural pacemaker in your heart to help it beat at a normal rate ICD \u2013 a device similar to a pacemaker that monitors your heart rhythm and shocks your heart back into a normal rhythm whenever this is needed Staying safe with an arrhythmia If you have an arrhythmia that affects your driving, you must tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). If your job involves working at height or with machinery that could be dangerous, you will need to stop work at least until your arrhythmia is diagnosed or you get treatment for your underlying condition.

This affects the heart's ability to pump blood around the body. Some types of cardiomyopathy are inherited and are seen in children and younger people. This page explains the main types of cardiomyopathy: dilated cardiomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy takotsubo cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome' It then explains:  diagnosing cardiomyopathy treating cardiomyopathy information about you Dilated cardiomyopathy In dilated cardiomyopathy the muscle walls of the heart have become stretched and thin, so they can't contract (squeeze) properly to pump blood around the body. How serious is it? If you have dilated cardiomyopathy, you're at greater risk of heart failure, where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure. Heart failure typically causes shortness of breath, extreme tiredness and ankle swelling. Learn more about the symptoms of heart failure. There's also a risk of heart valve problems, an irregular heartbeat and blood clots. You'll need to have regular appointments with your GP so the disease can be monitored. Who's affected? Dilated cardiomyopathy can affect both children and adults.  The heart muscle can become stretched if you have an unhealthy lifestyle or an underlying medical condition, or both. The following can all play a role in the disease: uncontrolled high blood pressure an unhealthy lifestyle \u2013 such as a lack of vitamins and minerals in the diet, heavy drinking and recreational drug use a viral infection that causes inflammation of the heart muscle   a heart valve problem a disease of the body tissues or vessels \u2013 such as Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, lupus, polyarteritis nodosa, vasculitis or muscular dystrophy inheriting a mutated (changed) gene that makes you more vulnerable to the disease pregnancy \u2013 cardiomyopathy can sometimes develop as a complication of pregnancy But for many people, the cause is unknown. More information Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on living with dilated cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle cells have enlarged and the walls of the heart chambers thicken. The chambers are reduced in size so they can't hold much blood, and the walls can't relax properly and may stiffen. How serious is it? Most people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will be able to live a full, normal life. Some people don't even have symptoms and don't need treatment. But that doesn't mean the condition can't be serious. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden unexpected death in childhood and in young athletes. The main heart chambers can become stiff, leading to back pressure on the smaller collecting chambers. This can sometimes worsen the symptoms of heart failure and lead to abnormal heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation). Blood flow from the heart may become reduced or restricted (known as obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Also, the mitral heart valve can become leaky, causing blood to leak backwards. Read more about mitral regurgitation. These heart changes can cause dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath and temporary loss of consciousness. You'll also be at greater risk of developing endocarditis (a heart infection). If you have severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, you'll need to see your doctor regularly so your condition can be monitored. Your doctor will advise about the level and amount of exercise you can do and sensible lifestyle changes to make.  Who's affected? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is thought to affect 1 in 500 people in the UK. Most people inherit the disease from their parents. Read more about how genetic conditions are inherited.   More information Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on living with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy is rare and mostly affects older adults. The walls of the main heart chambers become stiffened and rigid and can't relax properly after contracting. This means the heart can't fill up properly with blood. It results in reduced blood flow from the heart and can lead to symptoms of heart failure, such as breathlessness, tiredness and ankle swelling, as well as heart rhythm problems. In many cases the cause is unknown, although sometimes it can be inherited. More information Read the American Heart Association's leaflet on restrictive cardiomyopathy (PDF, 102kb). Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy In arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), the proteins that normally hold the heart muscle cells together are abnormal. Muscle cells can die and the dead muscle tissue is replaced with fatty and fibrous tissue. The walls of the main heart chambers become thin and stretched, and can't pump blood around the body properly. People with ARVC typically have heart rhythm problems. Reduced blood flow from the heart can also lead to symptoms of heart failure. ARVC is an uncommon inherited condition caused by a mutation (change) in one or more genes. It can affect teenagers or young adults and has been the reason for some sudden unexplained deaths in young athletes. There's increasing evidence that prolonged, strenuous exercise worsens the symptoms of ARVC. It's important that people with or at risk of ARVC have a careful discussion about this with their cardiologist. More information Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on ARVC. Diagnosing cardiomyopathy Some cases of cardiomyopathy can be diagnosed after various heart scans and tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an echocardiogram. Cardiomyopathy that runs in the family can be diagnosed after a genetic test. If you've been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, you may be advised to have a genetic test to identify the mutation (faulty gene) that caused this. Your relatives can then be tested for the same mutation and, if they have it, their condition can be monitored and managed early. Treating cardiomyopathy  There's no cure for cardiomyopathy, but the treatments described below are usually effective at controlling symptoms and preventing complications. Not everyone with cardiomyopathy will need treatment. Some people only have a mild form of the disease that they can control after making a few lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes If the cause of your cardiomyopathy isn't genetic, it should generally help to: follow a healthy diet and take gentle exercise quit smoking (if you smoke) lose weight (if you're overweight) avoid or reduce your intake of alcohol  get plenty of sleep manage stress make sure any underlying condition, such as diabetes, is well controlled  Medication Medication may be needed to control blood pressure, correct an abnormal heart rhythm, remove excess fluid or prevent blood clots.  Read about: medication for high blood pressure beta-blockers to treat an irregular heartbeat or heart failure diuretics to remove excess fluid from your body if this has caused swelling anticoagulants such as warfarin to prevent blood clots medication to treat heart failure Hospital procedures In some people with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the septum (the wall dividing the left and right side of the heart) is thickened and bulges into the main heart chamber. They may need to have either: an injection of alcohol into their heart \u2013 this is to reduce part of the muscle in the septum a septal myectomy \u2013 heart surgery to remove part of the thickened septum (the mitral valve may be repaired at the same time, if necessary) Those with heart rhythm problems may need to have a pacemaker, or a similar device, implanted to control their abnormal heart rhythm. Read more about having a pacemaker fitted. As a last resort, a heart transplant may be necessary. Information about you If you have cardiomyopathy, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. GOV.UK has more information about the register. Broken heart syndrome Some people who sustain significant emotional or physical stress, such as bereavement or major surgery, go on to experience a temporary heart problem. The heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or \"stunned\", causing the left ventricle (one of the heart's main chambers) to change shape. It may be caused by a surge of hormones, particularly adrenaline, during this period of stress. The main symptoms are chest pain and breathlessness, similar to those of a heart attack \u2013 always call 999 if you or someone else experiences these. The condition \u2013 known medically as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or acute stress cardiomyopathy \u2013 is temporary and reversible. It's unusual for it to happen again.

It's very dangerous, because it can obstruct the flow of blood to major organs. Depending on where the clot forms, arterial thrombosis can cause several serious conditions, including: heart attack \u2013 when blood flow to the heart is suddenly blocked  stroke \u2013 when blood flow to the brain is cut off  peripheral arterial disease (PAD), also known as peripheral vascular disease (PVD) \u2013 when a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries restricts the blood supply to leg muscles Heart attack and stroke are two of the leading causes of death in the UK. Who's at risk? Most cases of arterial thrombosis are caused when an artery is damaged by atherosclerosis. This is where fatty deposits called plaque build up on the walls of the arteries, causing them to harden and narrow. If the plaque ruptures (bursts), a blood clot may develop. Your risk of developing an arterial blood clot is increased if you: eat a high-fat diet smoke drink more units of alcohol than the recommended amount (men shouldn't regularly drink more than 3-4 units a day and women shouldn't regularly drink more than 2-3 units a day) are obese don't do regular exercise have diabetes (either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes) have high blood pressure (hypertension) have high cholesterol The risk of arterial thrombosis also increases with age, so older people are more commonly affected. Treating arterial thrombosis It's sometimes possible to treat arterial thrombosis with medication or surgery. Medication In some cases, a type of medication called a thrombolytic can be used to dissolve blood clots and restore the blood flow in an artery. Examples of thrombolytic medicines include alteplase and reteplase. These medicines are most effective if they're used as soon as possible after a heart attack or stroke starts. Surgery Surgery for arterial thrombosis involves unblocking the affected artery or re-routing the flow of blood around the blockage. The type of surgery used will depend on the location and severity of your condition. For example, you may need heart surgery if the blood clot is in an artery that supplies blood to your heart. Operations used to treat this include: coronary stent placement \u2013 where a balloon is inflated in a blocked artery (angioplasty) to allow a hollow metal tube called a stent to be used to widen the artery and stop it from becoming blocked again coronary artery bypass graft \u2013 where a blood vessel taken from another part of the body is used to bypass the point of the blockage If you have a blood clot in your neck, you may have a type of surgery called carotid endarterectomy. During this operation, the surgeon makes a cut in your neck to open up the artery and remove the fatty deposits. Reducing your risk It isn't possible to entirely prevent blood clots from forming, but there are numerous ways you can minimise your risk. Medication If you've previously had a blood clot, you may need to take medicines to reduce the risk of it happening again. These include: statins to lower your blood cholesterol levels  anticoagulant medicines \u2013 such as warfarin, sinthrone, dabigatran, apixiban, rivaroxaban, or antiplatelet medicines, such as low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel, to thin the blood and reduce the risk of clotting antihypertensive medicines to reduce high blood pressure \u2013 such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors Lifestyle You can also reduce your risk of developing arterial thrombosis and heart disease by: not smoking reducing the amount of salt you eat cutting down on fat (particularly saturated fat) eating at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day doing a minimum of 150 minutes (2 hours 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity exercise a week, such as fast walking, cycling or water aerobics (read more about the physical activity guidelines for adults) Other types of blood clot As well as arterial thrombosis, there are several other types of blood clot, including: venous thromboembolism (VTE) \u2013 a blood clot that develops in a vein deep vein thrombosis (DVT) \u2013 a blood clot in one of the deep veins in the body, usually in the leg embolism \u2013 a condition where the blood flow in an artery is blocked by a foreign body, such as a blood clot or an air bubble pulmonary embolism \u2013 a blood clot in the pulmonary artery, which is the blood vessel that transports blood from the heart to the lungs Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 18\/02\/2015 Next review due: 18\/02\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The images created during an angiography are called angiograms. Blood vessels don't show up clearly on ordinary X-rays, so a substance called contrast medium is injected into the area being examined. This highlights the blood vessels as it moves through them. The medical name for this type of angiography is catheterisation. Less commonly, angiographies can also be carried out non-invasively using computerised tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the technique used will depend on a number of factors. Why angiograms are used The heart is one of the most common areas of the body that needs to be checked using angiography. During coronary angiography, the flow of blood to the heart muscle can be assessed. The procedure can also be used to help diagnose coronary heart disease. Other conditions that affect blood vessels and the flow of blood through them can also be detected using angiography \u2013 for example, aneurysm (where a section of a blood vessel wall bulges due to a weakness in the wall). Serious arterial disease in the body can cause problems such as strokes, heart attacks, gangrene and organ failure, so for certain people it's important that circulation problems are investigated. The images from coronary angiography can be used to help plan treatment for angina and heart attacks. Treatment options include medication or surgery, such as a coronary angioplasty or a coronary artery bypass graft. Other areas of the body that can be examined using angiography include the: brain (cerebral angiography) lungs (pulmonary angiography) kidneys (renal angiography) arms or legs (extremity angiography) Read more about what angiography is used for.  The angiography procedure Angiography is carried out in hospital. It takes between 30 minutes and two hours, depending on the complexity of the investigation. You'll usually be allowed to go home on the same day, although in some cases you may need to stay in hospital overnight. Most angiographies are planned procedures carried out under local anaesthetic, sometimes with sedation. However, general anaesthetic may be used for young children or if the procedure is particularly complex. A very thin flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into one of your arteries through a small cut. The artery is usually in your groin or wrist. A radiologist (doctor who specialises in imaging studies) or cardiologist (heart specialist) will guide the catheter into the area that needs to be examined. The contrast medium will be injected through the catheter and into the blood vessel. A series of X-ray images will be taken. Read more about what happens during an angiography. Safety Generally, angiography is a safe and painless procedure and the risk of serious complications is low. There can sometimes be minor bruising where the catheter is inserted. Some people may occasionally have an allergic reaction to the contrast dye, although this can usually be easily treated with medication. Read more about the complications of an angiography.

These plaques cause the arteries to harden and narrow, restricting the blood flow and oxygen supply to vital organs, and increasing the risk of blood clots that could potentially block the flow of blood to the heart or brain. Atherosclerosis doesn't tend to have any symptoms at first, and many people may be unaware they have it, but it can eventually cause life-threatening problems such as heart attacks and strokes if it gets worse. However, the condition is largely preventable with a healthy lifestyle, and treatment can help reduce the risk of serious problems occurring. This page covers: Health risks Who's at risk Tests and diagnosis Reduce your risk Treatments Health risks of atherosclerosis If left to get worse, atherosclerosis can potentially lead to a number of serious conditions known as cardiovascular disease (CVD). There won't usually be any symptoms until CVD develops. Types of CVD include: coronary heart disease \u2013 the main arteries that supply your heart (the coronary arteries) become clogged with plaques angina \u2013 short periods of tight, dull or heavy chest pain caused by coronary heart disease, which may precede a heart attack heart attacks \u2013 where the blood supply to your heart is blocked, causing sudden crushing or indigestion-like chest pain that can radiate to nearby areas, as well as shortness of breath and dizziness strokes \u2013 where the blood supply to your brain is interrupted, causing the face to droop to one side, weakness on one side of the body, and slurred speech transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) \u2013 where there are temporary symptoms of a stroke peripheral arterial disease \u2013 where the blood supply to your legs is blocked, causing leg pain when walking Click on the links above for more information about these conditions, including what the main symptoms and risks are. Who's at risk of atherosclerosis? Exactly why and how arteries become clogged is unclear. It can happen to anyone, although the following things can increase your risk: increasing age smoking an unhealthy, high-fat diet lack of exercise being overweight or obese regularly drinking excessive amounts of alcohol other conditions, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes a family history of atherosclerosis and CVD being of south Asian, African or African-Caribbean descent You can't do anything about some of these factors, but by tackling things such as an unhealthy diet and a lack of exercise, you can help reduce your risk of atherosclerosis and CVD. Read more about the risk factors for CVD. Testing for atherosclerosis Speak to your GP if you're worried you may be at a high risk of atherosclerosis. If you're between the ages of 40 and 74, you should have an NHS Health Check every five years, which will include tests to find out if you're at risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

In the UK, around 10 million people have arthritis. It affects people of all ages, including children (see below). Types of arthritis The two most common types of arthritis are: osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK, affecting around 8 million people. It most often develops in adults who are in their late 40s or older. It's also more common in women and people with a family history of the condition. However, it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with other joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness. Once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder. This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs, called osteophytes. Severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position. The most commonly affected joints are those in the: hands spine knees hips Rheumatoid arthritis In the UK, rheumatoid arthritis affects more than 400,000 people. It often starts when a person is between 40 and 50 years old. Women are three times more likely to be affected than men. Rheumatoid and osteoarthritis are two different conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the body's immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling.  The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected. This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. This may cause the bone and cartilage to break down. People with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body.  Other types of arthritis and related conditions Ankylosing spondylitis \u2013 a long-term inflammatory condition that mainly affects the bones, muscles and ligaments of the spine, leading to stiffness and joints fusing together. Other problems can include the swelling of tendons, eyes and large joints. Cervical spondylosis \u2013 also known as degenerative osteoarthritis, cervical spondylitis affects the joints and bones in the neck, which can lead to pain and stiffness. Fibromyalgia \u2013 causes pain in the body's muscles, ligaments and tendons. Lupus \u2013 an autoimmune condition that can affect many different organs and the body's tissues. Gout \u2013 a type of arthritis caused by too much uric acid in the body. This can be left in joints (usually affecting the big toe) but can develop in any joint. It causes intense pain, redness and swelling. Psoriatic arthritis \u2013 an inflammatory joint condition that can affect people with psoriasis. Enteropathic arthritis \u2013 a form of chronic, inflammatory arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the two best-known types being ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. About one in five people with Crohn's or ulcerative colitis will develop enteropathic arthritis. The most common areas affected by inflammation are the peripheral (limb) joints and the spine. Reactive arthritis \u2013 this can cause inflammation of the joints, eyes and urethra (the tube that urine passes through). It develops shortly after an infection of the bowel, genital tract or, less frequently, after a throat infection. Secondary arthritis \u2013 a type of arthritis that can develop after a joint injury and sometimes occurs many years afterwards. Polymyalgia rheumatica \u2013 a condition that almost always affects people over 50 years of age, where the immune system causes muscle pain and stiffness, usually across the shoulders and tops of the legs. It can also cause joint inflammation. Symptoms of arthritis The symptoms of arthritis you experience will vary depending on the type you have. This is why it's important to have an accurate diagnosis if you have: joint pain, tenderness and stiffness inflammation in and around the joints restricted movement of the joints warm, red skin over the affected joint weakness and muscle wasting Arthritis and children Arthritis is often associated with older people, but it can also affect children. In the UK, about 15,000 children and young people are affected by arthritis. Most types of childhood arthritis are known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA causes pain and inflammation in one or more joints for at least six weeks. Although the exact cause of JIA is unknown, the symptoms often improve as a child gets older, meaning they can lead a normal life. The main types of JIA are discussed below. Arthritis Research UK has more information about the different types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Oligo-articular JIA Oligo-articular JIA is the most common type of JIA. It affects fewer than five joints in the body \u2013 most commonly in the knees, ankles and wrists. Oligo-articular JIA has good recovery rates and long-term effects are rare. However, there's a risk that children with the condition may develop eye problems, so regular eye tests with an ophthalmologist (eye care specialist) are recommended. Polyarticular JIA (polyarthritis) Polyarticular JIA, or polyarthritis, affects five or more joints. It can develop at any age during childhood. The symptoms of polyarticular JIA are similar to the symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis. The condition is often accompanied by a rash and a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above. Systemic onset JIA Systemic onset JIA begins with symptoms such as a fever, rash, lethargy (a lack of energy) and enlarged glands. Later on, joints can become swollen and inflamed. Like polyarticular JIA, systemic onset JIA can affect children of any age. Enthesitis-related arthritis Enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of juvenile arthritis that affects older boys or teenagers. It can cause pain in the soles of the feet and around the knee and hip joints, where the ligaments attach to the bone. Treating arthritis There's no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help slow down the condition. For osteoarthritis, medications are often prescribed, including: painkillers non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) corticosteroids In severe cases, the following surgical procedures may be recommended: arthroplasty (joint replacement) arthodesis (joint fusion) osteotomy (where a bone is cut and re-aligned) Read more about how osteoarthritis is treated. Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis aims to slow down the condition's progress and minimise joint inflammation or swelling. This is to try and prevent damage to the joints. Recommended treatments include: analgesics (painkillers) disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) \u2013 a combination of treatments is often recommended physiotherapy  regular exercise  Read more about how rheumatoid arthritis is treated.

It causes sudden attacks of severe pain and swelling. It's estimated that between one and two in every 100 people in the UK are affected by gout. The condition mainly affects men over 30 and women after the menopause. Overall, gout is more common in men than women. Gout can be extremely painful and debilitating, but treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms and prevent further attacks. Signs and symptoms of gout Any joint can be affected by gout, but it usually affects joints towards the ends of the limbs, such as the toes, ankles, knees and fingers. Signs and symptoms of gout include: severe pain in one or more joints the joint feeling hot and very tender swelling in and around the affected joint red, shiny skin over the affected joint   Symptoms develop rapidly over a few hours and typically last three to 10 days. After this time the pain should pass and the joint should return to normal. Almost everyone with gout will experience further attacks at some point, usually within a year. Read more about the symptoms of gout. When to see your GP See your GP if you suspect you have gout and it hasn't been previously diagnosed, particularly if the pain keeps getting worse and you also have a high temperature (fever). It's important that a diagnosis is confirmed because other conditions that require urgent treatment, such as an infected joint, can sometimes cause similar symptoms. If you've already been diagnosed with gout and you have an attack, see your GP if any medication you've been prescribed (see below) doesn't start working within a couple of days. Read more about diagnosing gout. What causes gout? Gout is caused by a build-up of a substance called uric acid in the blood. If you produce too much uric acid or your kidneys don't filter enough out, it can build up and cause tiny sharp crystals to form in and around joints. These crystals can cause the joint to become inflamed (red and swollen) and painful. Things that may increase your chances of getting gout include: obesity, high blood pressure and\/or diabetes having a close relative with gout kidney problems eating foods that cause a build-up of uric acid, such as red meat, offal and seafood drinking too much beer or spirits Read more about the causes of gout. Treatments for gout If you have gout, treatment is available from your GP to: relieve symptoms during an attack \u2013 this can be done using ice packs and by taking medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine or corticosteroids prevent further attacks \u2013 through a combination of lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or changing your diet, and taking medication that lowers uric acid levels, such as allopurinol  With treatment, many people are able to reduce their uric acid levels sufficiently to dissolve the crystals that cause gout \u2013 and as a result have no further attacks. However, lifelong treatment is usually required. Read more about treating gout. Can gout cause further problems? Sometimes gout can lead to further problems, particularly if it's left untreated. These can include: kidney stones small firm lumps of uric acid crystals under the skin called tophi permanent joint damage Read more about the complications of gout. What's pseudogout? Pseudogout is a similar condition to gout, but usually affects the knee joint first. It's a form of arthritis that causes pain, stiffness, tenderness, redness, warmth and swelling in one or more of your joints - commonly the knee or wrist.  Page last reviewed: 24\/09\/2015 Next review due: 24\/09\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

This topic covers: Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Living with osteoarthritis Prevention Symptoms of osteoarthritis The main symptoms of osteoarthritis are joint pain and stiffness. Some people also experience swelling, tenderness and a grating or crackling sound when moving the affected joints. The severity of osteoarthritis symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, and between different affected joints. For some people, the symptoms can be mild and may come and go. Other people can experience more continuous and severe problems which make it difficult to carry out everyday activities. Almost any joint can be affected by osteoarthritis, but the condition most often causes problems in the knees, hips and small joints of the hands. You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of osteoarthritis so they can confirm the diagnosis and prescribe any necessary treatment. Read more about the symptoms of osteoarthritis. Causes of osteoarthritis As part of normal life, your joints are exposed to a constant low level of damage. In most cases, your body repairs the damage itself and you don't experience any symptoms. But in osteoarthritis, the protective cartilage on the ends of your bones breaks down, causing pain, swelling and problems moving the joint. Bony growths can develop, and the area can become inflamed (red and swollen). The exact cause isn't known, but several things are thought to increase your risk of developing osteoarthritis, including: joint injury \u2013 overusing your joint when it hasn't had enough time to heal after an injury or operation other conditions (secondary arthritis) \u2013 osteoarthritis can occur in joints severely damaged by a previous or existing condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout age \u2013 your risk of developing the condition increases as you get older family history \u2013 osteoarthritis may run in families, although studies haven't identified a single gene responsible obesity \u2013 being obese puts excess strain on your joints, particularly those that bear most of your weight, such as your knees and hips Diagnosing osteoarthritis To help determine whether you have osteoarthritis, your GP will first ask you about your symptoms and examine your joints. Your GP may suspect osteoarthritis if: you're aged 50 or older you have joint pain that gets worse the more you use your joints you have stiffness in your joints in the morning that lasts less than 30 minutes, or no stiffness at all If your symptoms are slightly different from those listed above, this may indicate another joint condition. For example, prolonged joint stiffness in the morning can be a sign of rheumatoid arthritis. Further tests \u2013 such as X-rays or blood tests \u2013 aren't usually necessary, but may be used to rule out other possible causes, such as rheumatoid arthritis or a fractured bone. Treating osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis is a long-term condition and can't be cured, but it doesn't necessarily get any worse over time and it can sometimes gradually improve. A number of treatments are also available to reduce the symptoms. Mild symptoms can sometimes be managed with simple measures including: regular exercise losing weight if you're overweight wearing suitable footwear using special devices to reduce the strain on your joints during your everyday activities If your symptoms are more severe, you may need additional treatments such as painkilling medication and a structured exercise plan carried out under the supervision of a physiotherapist. In a small number of cases, where the above treatments haven't helped or the damage to the joints is particularly severe, surgery may be carried out to repair, strengthen or replace a damaged joint. Read more about treating osteoarthritis. Living with osteoarthritis As osteoarthritis is a long-term condition, it's important you receive support to help you cope with any issues such as reduced mobility, and advice on any necessary financial support. Some people may find it helpful to talk to their GP or others who are living with osteoarthritis, as there may be questions or worries you want to share. Read about living with osteoarthritis. Preventing osteoarthritis It's not possible to prevent osteoarthritis altogether. However, you may be able to minimise your risk of developing the condition by avoiding injury and staying as healthy as possible. Exercise Avoid exercise that puts strain on your joints and forces them to bear an excessive load, such as running and weight training. Instead, try exercises such as swimming and cycling, where your joints are better supported and the strain on your joints is more controlled. Try to do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (such as cycling or fast walking) every week to build up your muscle strength and keep yourself generally healthy. Read about health and fitness \u2013 including tips on simple exercises you can do at home. Posture It can also help to maintain good posture at all times and avoid staying in the same position for too long. If you work at a desk, make sure your chair is at the correct height, and take regular breaks to move around. Read about common posture mistakes and fixes. Losing weight Being overweight or obese can increase the strain on your joints and increase your risk of developing osteoarthritis. If you're overweight, losing weight may help lower your chances of developing the condition. To find out whether you're overweight or obese, use the healthy weight calculator.

It typically causes affected joints to become inflamed (swollen), stiff and painful. Between one and two in every five people with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis. It usually develops within 10 years of psoriasis being diagnosed, although some people may experience problems with their joints before they notice any symptoms affecting their skin. Like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is thought to occur as a result of the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue, but it's not clear why some people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis and others don't. Signs and symptoms The pain, swelling and stiffness associated with psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint in the body, but the condition often affects joints including the hands, feet, knees, neck, spine and elbows. The severity of the condition can vary considerably from person to person. Some people may have severe problems affecting many joints, whereas others may only notice mild symptoms in one or two joints. There may be times when your symptoms improve (known as remission) and periods when they get worse (known as flare-ups or relapses). Relapses can be very difficult to predict, but can often be managed with medication when they do occur. When to seek medical advice You should speak to your GP if you experience persistent pain, swelling or stiffness in your joints \u2013 even if you haven't been diagnosed with psoriasis. If you have been diagnosed with psoriasis, you should have check-ups at least once a year to monitor your condition. Make sure you let your doctor know if you are experiencing any problems with your joints. Diagnosing psoriatic arthritis If your doctor thinks you may have arthritis, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in joint conditions) for an assessment. A rheumatologist will usually be able to diagnose psoriatic arthritis if you have psoriasis and problems with your joints, and other types of arthritis \u2013 such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis \u2013 have been ruled out. A number of tests may be carried out to help confirm a diagnosis, including blood tests to check for signs of inflammation in your body and the presence of certain antibodies found in other types of arthritis, as well as X-rays or scans of your joints. Treating psoriatic arthritis The main aims of treatment will be to relieve your symptoms, slow the progression of the condition and improve your quality of life. For most people, this will involve trying a number of different medications, some of which can also treat the psoriasis. Ideally, you should take one medication to treat both your psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis whenever possible. The main medications used to treat psoriatic arthritis are summarised below. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Your GP may first prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to see if they help relieve pain and reduce inflammation. There are two types of NSAIDs and they work in slightly different ways: traditional NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, naproxen or diclofenac COX-2 inhibitors (often called coxibs), such as celecoxib or etoricoxib Like all medications, NSAIDs can have side effects, but your doctor will take precautions to reduce the risk of these, such as prescribing the lowest dose necessary to control your symptoms for the shortest time possible. If side effects do occur, they usually affect the stomach and intestines, and can include indigestion and stomach ulcers. A medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that helps protect your stomach by reducing the amount of acid it produces will therefore often be prescribed alongside NSAIDs. Read more about the side effects of NSAIDs. If NSAIDs alone are not helpful, some of the medications below may be recommended. Steroid medication (corticosteroids) Like NSAIDs, corticosteroids can help reduce pain and swelling.  If you have a single inflamed or swollen joint, your doctor may inject the medication directly into the joint. This can offer rapid relief with minimal side effects, and the effect can last from a few weeks to several months. Corticosteroids can also be taken as a tablet, or as an injection into the muscle, to help lots of joints. However, doctors are generally cautious about this because the medication can cause significant side effects if used in the long term, and psoriasis can flare up when you stop using it. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are medications that work by tackling the underlying causes of the inflammation in your joints. They can help to ease your symptoms and slow the progression of psoriatic arthritis. The earlier you start taking a DMARD, the more effective it will be. Leflunomide is often the first drug given for psoriatic arthritis. Sulfasalazine or methotrexate may be considered as alternatives. You can click on the above links for more information on these medications, including the side effects. It can take several weeks or months to notice a DMARD working. Therefore, it is important to keep taking the medication, even if it doesn't seem to be working at first. Biological treatments Biological treatments are a newer form of treatment for psoriatic arthritis. You may be offered one of these treatments if: your psoriatic arthritis has not responded to at least two different types of DMARD you are not able to be treated with at least two different types of DMARD Biological drugs work by stopping particular chemicals in the blood from activating your immune system to attack the lining of your joints. Some of the biological medicines you may be offered are adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, infliximab and golimumab injections. See our page on treating psoriasis for more information about these medications. The most common side effect of biological treatments is a reaction in the area of skin where the medication is injected, such as redness, swelling or pain, although these reactions aren\u2019t usually serious. However, biological treatments can sometimes cause other side effects, including problems with your liver, kidneys or blood count, so you will usually need to have regular blood or urine tests to check for these. Biological treatments can also make you more likely to develop infections, so you should tell your doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of an infection, such as a sore throat, a high temperature (fever), or diarrhoea. Biological medication will usually be recommended for three months at first, to see if it helps. If it is effective, the medication can be continued. Otherwise, your doctor may suggest stopping the medication or swapping to an alternative biological treatment. Complementary therapies There is not enough scientific research evidence to say that complementary therapies, such as balneotherapy (bathing in water containing minerals), works in treating psoriatic arthritis. There is also not enough evidence to support taking any kind of food supplement as treatment. Complementary therapies can sometimes react with other treatments, so you should talk to your GP, specialist or pharmacist if you are thinking of using any. Managing related conditions As with psoriasis and other types of inflammatory arthritis, you may be more likely to get some other conditions \u2013 such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) \u2013 if you have psoriatic arthritis. CVD is the term for conditions of the heart or blood vessels, such as heart disease and stroke. Your doctor should carry out tests each year (such as blood pressure and cholesterol tests) so they can check whether you have CVD and offer additional treatment, if necessary. You can also help yourself by: having a good balance between rest and regular physical activity losing weight, if you are overweight not smoking only drinking moderate amounts of alcohol Read more about living with psoriasis and preventing CVD. Your care team As well as your GP and a rheumatologist, you may also be cared for by: a specialist nurse \u2013 who will often be your first point of contact with your specialist care team a dermatologist (skin specialist) \u2013 who will be responsible for treating your psoriasis symptoms a physiotherapist \u2013 who can devise an exercise plan to keep your joints mobile an occupational therapist \u2013 who can identify any problems you have in everyday activities and find ways to overcome or manage these a psychologist \u2013 who can offer psychological support if you need it Outlook Like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is a long-term condition that can get progressively worse. In severe cases, there is a risk of the joints becoming permanently damaged or deformed, which may require surgical treatment. However, with an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, it is possible to slow down the progression of the condition and minimise or prevent permanent damage to the joints. Psoriatic arthritis often affects the joints in the hands  Joint pain Joint pain is a very common problem with many possible causes, but it's usually the result of injury or arthritis Page last reviewed: 10\/09\/2014 Next review due: 10\/09\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It is also known as infectious or bacterial arthritis. The condition is most commonly caused by staphylococcal or streptococcal bacteria. These bacteria may have entered a wound and travelled through your bloodstream to the affected joint, or may have infected your joint directly following an injury or during surgery. Any joint can be affected by septic arthritis \u2013 and more than one joint can be affected at a time \u2013 but the condition is most common in the knees and hips. You should see your GP or visit your local accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible if you think you or your child may have septic arthritis. The sooner the infection is picked up and treated, the better the outlook. If the condition is left untreated, it can become life-threatening and can lead to permanent joint damage. Signs and symptoms Septic arthritis typically causes severe pain, swelling, redness and heat in affected joints. These symptoms tend to develop quickly over a few hours or days. You may also have difficulty moving the affected joint and some people have a high temperature (fever). Young children with septic arthritis will generally be irritable and may cry whenever the infected joint is moved (for example, during nappy changing). They may also try to avoid using or putting any weight on affected joints. Who's at risk? Septic arthritis can be seen at any age, including in babies and infants, although it is less common in older children, teenagers and young adults. The following factors can increase your risk of septic arthritis: having an artificial joint implant, such as a knee replacement or hip replacement having a bacterial infection somewhere else in your body having a long-term condition such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis using injected drugs taking medication that suppresses your immune system recently injuring a joint recently having joint surgery or injections into your joints Diagnosis septic arthritis If your symptoms suggest septic arthritis, your GP will refer you to your nearest A&E department immediately for an assessment. You may have a blood test and a sample of fluid removed from your affected joint with a needle to look for signs of inflammation and infection, and to identify any bacteria. If you have septic arthritis, there may be high numbers of white blood cells (a sign of infection) in your blood and joint fluid. However, in many cases these tests come back normal, so they cannot be relied upon to rule out the infection. Treating septic arthritis Septic arthritis is treated with antibiotics. You will normally need to stay in hospital for at least two weeks to have antibiotics given to you intravenously (directly into a vein). You may need to rest in bed for a few days to take pressure off the affected joint and you will be given medication to relieve the pain. You might also have the fluid drained from your infected joint using a needle and syringe, or during a procedure called an arthroscopy (where a fine, metal tube is inserted through a small incision near the affected joint). This will normally be done by the orthopaedic surgeon. After you finish the course of intravenous antibiotics, you'll probably need to take antibiotic tablets at home for at least another four weeks. You should completely recover after antibiotic treatment, although some people still experience persistent limited movement in the affected joint. Septic arthritis commonly affects the knees  Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 06\/11\/2014 Next review due: 06\/11\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Connective tissues provide support in skin, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, internal organs and bones. There are several different types of EDS that may share some symptoms, including: an increased range of joint movement (joint hypermobility) stretchy skin fragile skin that breaks or bruises easily The different types of EDS are caused by faults in certain genes that make connective tissue weaker. Depending on the type of EDS, the faulty gene may have been inherited from one parent, or both parents. Sometimes the faulty gene isn\u2019t inherited, but occurs in the person for the first time. EDS can affect people in different ways. For some the condition is relatively mild, while for others their symptoms can be disabling. Some of the rare severe types can be life-threatening. This pages covers: Main types of EDS Getting medical advice Living with EDS How EDS is inherited Information about you Links to more information Main types of EDS EDS-hypermobile type is the most common type of EDS. Rarer types include classical EDS, vascular EDS and kyphoscoliotic EDS. EDS-hypermobile type EDS-hypermobile type (EDS-HT), also known as hypermobile EDS or EDS type III, is often thought to be the same as or very similar to another condition called joint hypermobility syndrome. People with EDS-HT may have: joint hypermobility loose, unstable joints that dislocate easily joint pain and clicking joints extreme tiredness (fatigue) skin that bruises easily digestive problems, such as heartburn and constipation dizziness and an increased heart rate after standing up problems with internal organs, such as mitral valve prolapse or organ prolapse problems with bladder control (stress incontinence) Currently, there are no tests to confirm whether someone has EDS-HT. The diagnosis is made based on a person's medical history and a physical examination. Classical EDS Classical EDS (previously EDS types I and II) is less common than hypermobile EDS and tends to affect the skin more. People with classical EDS may have: joint hypermobility loose, unstable joints that dislocate easily stretchy skin fragile skin that can split easily \u2013 especially over the forehead, knees, shins and elbows smooth, velvety skin that bruises easily wounds that are slow to heal and leave wide scars hernias and organ prolapse Vascular EDS Vascular EDS (previously EDS type IV) is a rare type of EDS and is often considered to be the most serious. It affects the blood vessels and internal organs, which can cause them to split open and lead to life-threatening bleeding. People with vascular EDS may have: skin that bruises very easily thin skin with visible small blood vessels, particularly on the upper chest and legs  fragile blood vessels that can bulge or tear, resulting in serious internal bleeding a risk of organ problems, such as the bowel tearing, the womb tearing (in late pregnancy) and partial collapse of the lung hypermobile fingers and toes, unusual facial features, (such as a thin nose and lips, large eyes and small earlobes), varicose veins and delayed wound healing Kyphoscoliotic EDS Kyphoscoliotic EDS (previously EDS type VI) is rare. People with kyphoscoliotic EDS may have: curvature of the spine \u2013 this starts in early childhood and often gets worse in the teenage years joint hypermobility loose, unstable joints that dislocate easily weak muscle tone from childhood (hypotonia) \u2013 this may cause a delay in sitting and walking, or difficulty walking if symptoms get worse fragile eyes that can easily be damaged soft, velvety skin that is stretchy, bruises easily and scars Getting medical advice See your GP if you have several troublesome symptoms of EDS. You don't usually need to worry if you only have a few symptoms and they're not causing any problems. Joint hypermobility, for example, is common in healthy people and is unlikely to be caused by EDS if you don't have any other symptoms. Your GP may refer you to a joint specialist (rheumatologist) if you have problems with your joints and they suspect EDS. If there's a possibility you may have one of the rare types of EDS, your GP can refer you to your local genetics service for an assessment. The local genetics specialist will ask about your medical history, family history, assess your symptoms and may carry out a genetic blood test to confirm the diagnosis. If further investigation is needed, your hospital doctor can refer you to a  specialist EDS diagnostic service based in Sheffield and London. Living with EDS There's no specific treatment for EDS, but with support and advice it's possible to manage many of the symptoms. Adapting your activities It's important to be careful about activities that put a lot of strain on your joints or put you at risk of injury. However, it's important not to be overprotective and avoid living an otherwise normal life. Advice will depend on which type of EDS you have and how it affects you. you may be advised to avoid some activities entirely, such as heavy lifting and contact sports for some activities, you may need to wear appropriate protection and be taught how to reduce the strain on your joints lower-risk activities, such as swimming or pilates, may be recommended to help you stay fit and healthy if fatigue is a problem, you can be taught ways to conserve your energy and pace your activities For more tips and advice on joint care, you can read about living with EDS on the Ehlers-Danlos Support UK website. Specialist support People with EDS may also benefit from support from a number of different healthcare professionals. For example: a physiotherapist can teach you exercises to help strengthen your joints, avoid injuries and manage pain an occupational therapist can help you manage daily activities and give advice on equipment that may help you counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be useful if you're struggling to cope with long-term pain for certain types of EDS, regular scans carried out in hospital can detect problems with internal organs genetic counselling can help you learn more about the cause of your condition, how it's inherited, and what the risks of passing it on to your children are (see below) Your GP or consultant can refer you to these services. How EDS is inherited EDS can be inherited, but in some cases it occurs by chance in someone without a family history of the condition. The two main ways that EDS is inherited are: autosomal dominant inheritance (hypermobile, classical and vascular EDS) \u2013 the faulty gene that causes EDS is passed on by one parent and there's a 50% risk of each of their children developing the condition autosomal recessive inheritance (kyphoscoliotic EDS) \u2013 the faulty gene is inherited from both parents and there's a 25% risk of each of their children developing the condition A person with EDS can only pass on the same type of EDS to their children. For example, the children of someone with hypermobile EDS can't inherit vascular EDS. The severity of the condition can vary within the same family. Information about you If you have EDS, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

It's most commonly used on the knees, ankles, shoulders, elbows, wrists and hips. An arthroscopy involves the use of a device called an arthroscope to examine the joints. This is a thin, metal tube about the length and width of a drinking straw that contains a light source and a camera. Images are sent from the arthroscope to a video screen or an eyepiece, so the surgeon is able to see inside the joint. It's also possible for tiny surgical instruments to be used alongside an arthroscope to allow the surgeon to treat certain joint conditions. As the equipment used during an arthroscopy is so small, only minor cuts need to be made in the skin. This means the procedure has some potential advantages over traditional, \"open\" surgery, including: less pain after the operation  faster healing time lower risk of infection you can often go home the same day you may be able to return to normal activities more quickly Why it's used An arthroscopy might be recommended if you have problems such as persistent joint pain, swelling or stiffness, and scans have not been able to identify the cause. An arthroscopy can also be used to treat a range of joint problems and conditions. For example, it can be used to: repair damaged cartilage remove fragments of loose bone or cartilage drain away any excess fluid treat conditions such as arthritis, frozen shoulder or carpal tunnel syndrome Read more about when an arthroscopy may be used. What happens during an arthroscopy? The arthroscope is inserted through a small cut in the skin made next to the joint. Further small incisions may also be made to allow an examining probe or surgical instruments to be inserted. Your surgeon will then examine the inside of the joint using the arthroscope and, if necessary, remove or repair any problem areas. This will usually be done under general anaesthetic, although sometimes a spinal or local anaesthetic is used. The procedure is usually performed as a day case, which means you'll normally be able to go home on the same day as the surgery. Read more about how an arthroscopy is performed. Recovering from an arthroscopy The time it takes to recover from an arthroscopy can vary, depending on the joint involved and the specific procedure you had. It's often possible to return to work and light, physical activities within a few weeks, but more demanding physical activities such as lifting and sport may not be possible for several months. Your surgeon or care team will advise you how long it's likely to take to fully recover and what activities you should avoid until you're feeling better. While you're recovering, you should contact your surgical team or GP for advice if you think you may have developed one of the complications mentioned below. Read more about recovering from an arthroscopy. What are the risks? An arthroscopy is generally considered to be a safe procedure, but like all types of surgery it does carry some risks. It's normal to experience short-lived problems such as swelling, bruising, stiffness and discomfort after an arthroscopy. These will usually improve during the days or weeks following the procedure. More serious problems are much less common, occurring in less than 1 in 100 cases. They include: a blood clot that develops in one of the limbs \u2013 this is known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and it can cause pain and swelling in the affected limb infection inside the joint \u2013 this is known as septic arthritis and it can cause a high temperature (fever), pain and swelling in the joint bleeding inside the joint \u2013 which often causes severe pain and swelling accidental damage to the nerves that are near the joint \u2013 this can lead to numbness and some loss of sensation, which may be temporary or permanent Speak to your surgeon about the possible risks before agreeing to have an arthroscopy.

It's also known as intrauterine insemination (IUI). Artificial insemination on the NHS The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that up to six cycles of IUI treatment on the NHS may be offered if: you're unable (or would find it very difficult) to have vaginal sex \u2013 for example, because of a physical disability or psychosexual problem you have a condition (such as a viral infection that can be sexually transmitted) that means you need specific help to conceive you're in a same-sex relationship If six cycles don't work, you may sometimes be able to have a further six cycles before in vitro fertilisation (IVF) is considered. Previously, IUI treatment on the NHS was offered if a man had mild fertility problems, a woman had mild endometriosis, or a couple had unexplained infertility. However, guidelines now state that IUI shouldn't be offered in these circumstances. Instead, you should be advised to keep trying to conceive through regular unprotected sex for a total of two years. After this time has elapsed, you may be offered IVF. Availability The availability of artificial insemination on the NHS varies throughout the UK. In some areas, the waiting list for treatment can be very long. The criteria that must be met to be eligible for treatment can also vary. IUI is also available from some private fertility clinics. Costs vary, but usually range from around £500 to £1,000 for each cycle of treatment. What happens Assessment Before IUI is carried out, a couple\u2019s fertility may need to be assessed to find out why they are having difficulty conceiving and to determine whether artificial insemination is suitable. Read more about diagnosing infertility. For a woman to have IUI, her fallopian tubes (the tubes connecting the ovaries to the womb) must be open and healthy, because this is where the sperm will fertilise the egg and how the resulting embryo moves down into the womb. The fallopian tubes can be assessed using one of three methods: a laparoscopy \u2013 where a thin, tubular microscope inserted through a small cut in the tummy is used to look closely at the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries hysterosalpingogram \u2013 an X-ray of the womb and fallopian tubes taken after a special dye has been injected hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy) \u2013 which involves carrying out a vaginal ultrasound scan to check the fallopian tubes for blockages Timing of treatment To maximise the chances of success, a cycle of IUI should be carried out just after ovulation. It's difficult to predict exactly when this will occur, but in most women it usually happens between 12 and 16 days after they have their period. You may be given an ovulation prediction kit (OPK) to work out the date of ovulation with greater accuracy. An OPK device can detect hormones released during ovulation in urine or saliva. Alternatively, blood tests may be used to find out when you are about to ovulate. Occasionally, fertility medication is used to stimulate ovulation. In these cases, vaginal ultrasound scans are used to track the development of your eggs. As soon as an egg is mature, you will be given a hormone injection to stimulate its release. IUI using a partner\u2019s sperm If a couple decides to have IUI using their own sperm, the man will be asked to provide a sperm sample at the fertility clinic by masturbating into a specimen cup, usually on the same day that IUI treatment takes place. The sperm sample will be \"washed\" and filtered using special equipment to remove any dead sperm and impurities. The faster-moving sperm will be kept and any slow-moving sperm will be removed. This produces a concentrated sample of healthy sperm. An instrument called a speculum is inserted into the woman's vagina to keep it open. A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is then placed inside the vagina and guided into the womb. This process is mostly painless, although some women experience mild, short-lived cramping. The sperm sample will then be passed through the catheter and into the womb. The process usually takes no more than 10 minutes, and the couple should be able to go home shortly after the procedure is finished. IUI using a donor\u2019s sperm If a male partner cannot produce healthy sperm, or a same-sex couple are having IUI, frozen sperm from a donor is used. This can be from someone the couple knows, although sperm is usually obtained from a registered or licensed sperm bank.  Choosing to use donated sperm can be a difficult decision, and a couple will often have counselling before a decision is made by the clinic to proceed. Read more about using a sperm donor. If a couple decides to have IUI using the sperm of a donor, the same procedure is used. However, a sample of frozen sperm from a donor will be thawed out before being \"washed\" and inserted into the woman's womb. All donated sperm is carefully checked for: infections, such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C genetic and hereditary disorders, such as sickle-cell anaemia and cystic fibrosis The sperm bank can provide information about the physical characteristics of available donors, such as their ethnicity, physical build, and hair and eye colour. This will enable a couple to try to match a potential donor\u2019s characteristics with their own. Chances of success Figures from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) suggest that each cycle of IUI with donor sperm has a success rate of: 15.8% for women under 35  11.0% for women aged 35-39  4.7% for women aged 40-42  1.2% for women aged 43-44  0% for women over 44  As well as the woman's age, the changes of success can also be affected by the sperm count and sperm quality (using fresh sperm is associated with higher conception rates than frozen and thawed sperm) and technical aspects of IUI, such as working out the time of ovulation correctly. Overall, more than half of the women who have IUI will become pregnant during the first six treatment cycles. If IUI fails after several attempts, your doctor may suggest trying another treatment, such as IVF. Are there any risks? Risks involved with IUI are minimal, although some women experience mild cramps similar to period pains. In cases where medication is used to stimulate ovulation, there is a small risk of a reaction to the medication and a chance of an unintended multiple pregnancy (such as twins or triplets). You\u2019ll be monitored with ultrasound scans to check for a potential multiple pregnancy and the treatment cycle can be abandoned if necessary to avoid this.

Around one in seven couples may have difficulty conceiving. This is approximately 3.5 million people in the UK. About 84% of couples will conceive naturally within one year if they have regular unprotected sex. For every 100 couples trying to conceive naturally: 84 will conceive within one year 92 will conceive within two years  93 will conceive within three years For couples who have been trying to conceive for more than three years without success, the likelihood of pregnancy occurring within the next year is 25% or less. Deciding to seek help Some women get pregnant quickly, but for others it can take longer. It is a good idea for a couple to visit their GP if they have not conceived after one year of trying. Women aged 36 and over, and anyone who is already aware they may have fertility problems, should see their GP sooner. The GP can check for common causes of fertility problems, and suggest treatments that could help. A couple will only be diagnosed as being infertile if they have not managed to have a baby after one year of trying. There are two types of infertility: primary infertility \u2013 where someone who has never conceived a child in the past has difficulty conceiving secondary infertility \u2013 where a person has had one or more pregnancies in the past, but is having difficulty conceiving again Read more information about how infertility is diagnosed. What causes infertility? There are many potential causes of infertility, and fertility problems can affect either the man or the woman. However, it is not always possible to identify the cause. Common causes of infertility in women include lack of regular ovulation (the monthly release of an egg), blockage of the fallopian tubes and endometriosis. However, for 25% of couples, the cause is unexplained. In men, the most common cause is poor quality of semen (the fluid containing sperm that is ejaculated during sex). For some people, leading a healthy lifestyle and staying up to date with regular health checks and tests may help to prevent infertility. What treatment is available? Types of fertility treatment available include: medical treatment for lack of regular ovulation surgical procedures \u2013 such as treatment for endometriosis assisted conception \u2013 which may be intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) The treatment offered will depend on what is causing your fertility problems and what is available from your local CCG. You may wish to consider private treatment. This can be expensive, and there is no guarantee it will be successful. It is important to choose a private clinic carefully. You can ask your GP for advice, and you should make sure you choose a clinic that is licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Read more about how infertility is treated. Some types of infertility treatment can cause complications, including: side effects of medication increased risk of ectopic pregnancy multiple pregnancy stress Read more about complications associated with infertility treatments.

Asbestos is a general term for a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres. In the past, it was widely used in construction. Asbestos can be very dangerous. It does not present a health risk if it is undisturbed, but if material containing asbestos is chipped, drilled, broken or allowed to deteriorate, it can release a fine dust that contains asbestos fibres. When the dust is breathed in, the asbestos fibres enter the lungs and can gradually damage them over time. For asbestosis to develop, prolonged exposure to relatively high numbers of the fibres is necessary. However, it is not the only factor, as many people avoid getting asbestosis, despite heavy exposure. Read more about the causes of asbestosis. Symptoms of asbestosis Breathing in asbestos fibres may eventually scar the lungs of some people, which can lead to a number of symptoms, including: shortness of breath \u2013 this may only occur after physical activity at first, but it can eventually become a more constant problem a persistent cough wheezing fatigue (extreme tiredness) chest pain in more advanced cases, clubbed (swollen) fingertips Nowadays, most people who are diagnosed with asbestosis were exposed many years ago, before there were effective controls on exposure to asbestos fibres in the workplace. See your GP if you have the above symptoms and you think you may have been exposed to asbestos in the past. Read more about diagnosing asbestosis. Treating asbestosis There is no cure for asbestosis once it has developed, because it is not possible to reverse the damage to the lungs. One of the most important things someone with the condition can do is to stop smoking, if they smoke. This is because the symptoms are more likely to get worse in people who smoke, and smoking also increases the risk of lung cancer in people with asbestosis. If necessary, treatments such as oxygen therapy can improve the quality of life of someone with asbestosis. Read more about treating asbestosis. Outlook The outlook for asbestosis can vary significantly, depending on the extent of damage to the lungs and whether any other conditions are present. Asbestosis can get worse over time and severe cases can place a significant strain on a person's health and shorten their life expectancy, but in many cases the condition progresses very slowly or not at all. However, people with asbestosis have a higher risk of developing other serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as: pleural disease \u2013 where the membrane covering the lungs (pleura) becomes thicker, which can further contribute to breathlessness and chest discomfort mesothelioma \u2013 a type of cancer that affects the membrane that covers the lungs, heart and gut lung cancer Overall, more people with asbestosis die as a result of one of the cancers mentioned above, or from natural causes, than from asbestosis itself. Compensation If you have been diagnosed with asbestosis, you may be able to claim compensation. This can be done through: industrial injuries disablement benefit \u2013 this is a weekly benefit that may be paid to people with asbestosis who were exposed to asbestos while in employment (but not self-employed) a civil claim for compensation through the courts \u2013 you will need to obtain legal advice about how to do this a claim for a lump compensation sum under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979 \u2013 if you have asbestosis, or you are the dependant of someone who has died from the condition, and you haven't been able to get compensation through the courts because the employer who exposed you (or the person on whose behalf you are claiming) has ceased trading Read more about industrial injuries disablement benefit on the GOV.UK website. Preventing asbestosis There are three main types of asbestos that were used in construction. Two of these \u2013 called crocidolite and amosite \u2013 were banned in 1985 (although voluntary bans came into force earlier than this) and the use of the third type (chrysotile) was widely banned in 1999. However, despite these strict regulations having been in place for a number of years, large amounts of asbestos are still found in many older buildings. It's therefore important to take precautions to reduce your risk of inhaling asbestos fibres if you live or work in a building that may contain asbestos. If you are concerned that your house may contain asbestos, you can seek advice from an environmental health officer at your local authority or council. Do not attempt to remove any materials that you think may contain asbestos yourself. If your job means you could potentially be exposed to asbestos fibres, make sure you are fully aware of what you can do to reduce your risk. Do not attempt to remove any asbestos you come across, unless you have been trained in how to do this safely. Read about preventing asbestosis. Who is affected Asbestosis is a relatively rare condition, because it takes a considerable degree of asbestos exposure to cause it, and regulations to restrict exposure have been in place for many years. However, in 2011 there were 178 deaths directly caused by asbestosis and 429 where the condition was thought to have played a role. 980 new cases were assessed for industrial injuries disablement benefit during 2012.

In children with ASD, the symptoms are present before three years of age, although a diagnosis can sometimes be made after the age of three. It's estimated that about 1 in every 100 people in the UK has ASD. More boys are diagnosed with the condition than girls. There's no \"cure\" for ASD, but speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, educational support, plus a number of other interventions are available to help children and parents. Read about help and support available for people with ASD. Signs and symptoms People with ASD tend to have problems with social interaction and communication. In early infancy, some children with ASD don\u2019t babble or use other vocal sounds. Older children have problems using non-verbal behaviours to interact with others \u2013 for example, they have difficulty with eye contact, facial expressions, body language and gestures. They may give no or brief eye contact and ignore familiar or unfamiliar people. Children with ASD may also lack awareness of and interest in other children. They\u2019ll often either gravitate to older or younger children, rather than interacting with children of the same age. They tend to play alone. They can find it hard to understand other people's emotions and feelings, and have difficulty starting conversations or taking part in them properly. Language development may be delayed, and a child with ASD won\u2019t compensate their lack of language or delayed language skills by using gestures (body language) or facial expressions. Children with ASD will tend to repeat words or phrases spoken by others (either immediately or later) without formulating their own language, or in parallel to developing their language skills. Some children don\u2019t demonstrate imaginative or pretend play, while others will continually repeat the same pretend play. Some children with ASD like to stick to the same routine and little changes may trigger tantrums. Some children may flap their hand or twist or flick their fingers when they\u2019re excited or upset. Others may engage in repetitive activity, such as turning light switches on and off, opening and closing doors, or lining things up. Children and young people with ASD frequently experience a range of cognitive (thinking), learning, emotional and behavioural problems. For example, they may also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, or depression. About 70% of children with ASD have a non-verbal IQ below 70. Of these, 50% have a non-verbal IQ below 50. Overall, up to 50% of people with \"severe learning difficulties\" have an ASD. Read more about the symptoms of ASD. Getting a diagnosis The main features of ASD \u2013 problems with social communication and interaction \u2013 can often be recognised during early childhood. Some features of ASD may not become noticeable until a change of situation, such as when the child starts nursery or school. See your GP or health visitor if you notice any of the signs and symptoms of ASD in your child, or if you're concerned about your child's development. It can also be helpful to discuss your concerns with your child's nursery or school. Read more about diagnosing ASD. Caring for someone with ASD Being a carer isn't an easy role. When you're busy responding to the needs of others, it can affect your emotional and physical energy, and make it easy to forget your own health and mental wellbeing. If you're caring for someone else, it's important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It's in your best interests and those of the person you care for. Read more about care and support, including information on: carers' assessments support and the benefits carers are entitled to carers' breaks and respite care You can also call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053. What causes ASD? The exact cause of ASD is unknown, but it's thought that several complex genetic and environmental factors are involved. In the past, some people believed the MMR vaccine caused ASD, but this has been investigated extensively in a number of major studies around the world, involving millions of children, and researchers have found no evidence of a link between MMR and ASD. Read more about the causes of ASD. Autism in adults Some people with ASD had features of the condition as a child, but enter adulthood without ever being diagnosed. However, getting a diagnosis as an adult can often help a person with ASD and their families understand the condition, and work out what type of advice and support they need. For example, a number of autism-specific services are available that provide adults with ASD with the help and support they need to live independently and find a job that matches their skills and abilities.

It usually affects the respiratory system (windpipe, sinuses and lungs) and causes wheezing and coughing, but it can spread to anywhere in the body. Aspergillosis can usually be treated with medication, but in a few cases it's very serious and potentially life-threatening. How do you get aspergillosis? You can get aspergillosis if you inhale tiny particles of the aspergillus mould that hang in the air. The mould is found in many different places, but it's particularly common in: rotting leaves and compost plants, trees and crops air conditioning and heating systems insulation material dust In most people, inhaling aspergillus particles isn't a problem, because your immune system quickly destroys them. However, aspergillosis can develop if you have a pre-existing lung condition, such as asthma or cystic fibrosis, or if you have a weakened immune system. Aspergillosis isn't contagious, so it can't be passed from person to person. Read more about the causes of aspergillosis. Symptoms of aspergillosis The symptoms of aspergillosis vary. General symptoms can include: shortness of breath a persistent cough coughing up mucus or coughing up blood fatigue weight loss a high temperature Contact your doctor if you develop severe or persistent symptoms of aspergillosis, particularly if you have a weak immune system. There are several tests that can lead to a diagnosis. Read more about the symptoms of aspergillosis and diagnosing aspergillosis. Types of aspergillosis The main types of aspergillosis that affect the lungs are: allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis chronic pulmonary aspergillosis invasive pulmonary aspergillosis Aspergillus mould can also sometimes infect other parts of the body, including the skin, eyes, sinuses and other internal organs, mainly in people with a weak immune system. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is caused by an allergy to inhaled aspergillus particles and typically causes wheezing, shortness of breath, a cough with mucus and sometimes blood. It's caused by the immune system reacting to the aspergillus mould. ABPA usually affects people with asthma or cystic fibrosis. It's estimated that around 1 in every 40 people with asthma may be affected by ABPA. There's also a very similar condition called severe asthma with fungal sensitisation (SAFS). Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is a long-term infection that usually only affects people with an underlying lung condition, such as tuberculosis (TB), chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) or sarcoidosis. Along with a persistent cough, breathlessness, tiredness and weight loss, coughing up blood is a common symptom. CPA can sometimes cause an aspergilloma (a fungal ball) to grow in the lungs. It can also result in the lungs becoming permanently scarred if it isn't treated.  It's estimated that around 400-750 people in England have CPA. CPA requires specialist follow up treatment with antifungal medications and is usually long-term. The National Aspergillosis Centre offers specialist follow up of patients with CPA. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) usually only affects people with a weak immune system, such as people who have received a bone marrow transplant or cancer treatment, or those with HIV or AIDS. It's the most serious type of aspergillosis. If you have IPA, it's likely you'll have a raised temperature as well as lung symptoms, such as a cough, chest pain or breathlessness. In IPA, the aspergillus mould can spread through the bloodstream from the lungs to the brain, eyes, heart or kidneys. This is very serious and can be life-threatening if it's not treated quickly. IPA is estimated to affect up to one in every four people who've had a bone marrow transplant, a heart or lung transplant, or high-dose chemotherapy for leukaemia (cancer of the blood cells). Treatments for aspergillosis Treatment for aspergillosis depends on the specific type. ABPA and SAFS are usually treated with steroid medication to dampen the reaction of the immune system to the aspergillus particles, and antifungal medication to help kill the mould. CPA and aspergilloma can be treated with long-term antifungal medication. In some cases, surgery may be needed to remove an aspergilloma from the lungs, prevent bleeding in the lungs, or remove infected tissue. IPA is treated in hospital with powerful antifungal medications given by a drip into a vein. The infection can spread very quickly, and people who develop IPA are usually already very ill. This means that, unfortunately, around half of those with the condition die from it. Read more about how aspergillosis is treated. Preventing aspergillosis It's almost impossible to avoid the aspergillus mould completely, but there are precautions you can take to reduce your exposure if you're at risk of aspergillosis. Try to avoid places where the mould is often found, such as: compost heaps grain stores rotting vegetation piles of dead leaves marshland and bogs forests If you have a weakened immune system, you may also be advised to take extra precautions, such as wearing a face mask and taking a long-term course of antifungal medication.

It comes in many forms, including pills, tablets that are dissolved in water, powders and oral gels. Some types can be bought over the counter from pharmacies, while others are only available on prescription. This page covers: Uses for aspirin Who can and can't take aspirin How to take aspirin Side effects of aspirin Interactions with other medicines, food and alcohol Missed or extra doses Uses for aspirin At high doses \u2013 usually 300mg \u2013 aspirin can relieve pain, reduce a high temperature (fever) and reduce swelling. It's often used for short-term relief from: headaches and migraines toothache period pains general aches and pains colds and flu Long-term treatment with low doses of aspirin \u2013 usually 75mg \u2013 has an antiplatelet effect, which means it makes the blood less sticky and can stop blood clots developing. A doctor may recommend this if you have or have had: a heart attack or angina a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) peripheral arterial disease (PAD) coronary artery bypass surgery or another operation on your heart or blood vessels Aspirin may also be prescribed for children after heart surgery or to treat Kawasaki disease. But it shouldn't be given to anyone under 16 years old without medical supervision. Who can and can't take aspirin Most people can take aspirin safely. But you should get advice from a pharmacist or doctor before taking it if you: have had an allergic reaction to aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, in the past have asthma have had stomach ulcers in the past have severe liver or kidney problems have haemophilia or another bleeding disorder have uncontrolled high blood pressure are looking for medication for a child under 16 \u2013 medication containing aspirin shouldn't be given to children under 16 are over 65 years of age are pregnant, breastfeeding or trying to get pregnant are taking other medications \u2013 see Interactions with other medicines, below You may still be able to take aspirin in these cases, but you should only do so if advised that it's safe by a healthcare professional. If you can't take aspirin, a different medicine, such as paracetamol (for pain) or clopidogrel (to prevent blood clots), may be recommended instead. How to take aspirin Your pharmacist or doctor can tell you how often to take your aspirin and how much you should take. You can also check the recommendations in the leaflet that comes with your medicine. Generally speaking: high-dose aspirin (to relive pain) can be taken three or four times a day, with at least four hours between each dose, until your symptoms improve low-dose aspirin (to prevent blood clots) is taken once a day, usually for the rest of your life Some medicine leaflets advise taking aspirin with water, while others may recommend taking it before or after food.  Follow the instructions in the leaflet or label that comes with your medicine. Ask your pharmacist if you're not sure. Side effects of aspirin Like all medications, there's a risk of side effects from aspirin. The most common side effects are:  indigestion and stomach aches \u2013 taking your medicine with food may help reduce this risk bleeding or bruising more easily than normal Uncommon and rare side effects include: hives \u2013 a raised, itchy rash tinnitus \u2013 hearing sounds that come from inside your body breathing difficulties or an asthma attack an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause breathing problems, swelling of the mouth, lips or throat, and a sudden rash bleeding in the stomach \u2013 this can cause dark, tar-like stools or vomiting blood bleeding in the brain \u2013 this can cause a sudden, severe headache, vision problems and stroke symptoms, such as slurred speech and weakness on one side of the body Speak to your doctor if you experience any concerning or troublesome side effects while taking aspirin. Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if you think you're having a severe allergic reaction, or you have symptoms of bleeding in your stomach or brain. Interactions with other medicines, food and alcohol Aspirin can potentially interact with other medications, including some complementary and herbal medicines, which could alter their effects or increase your risk of side effects. Medicines that can interact with aspirin include: NSAIDs \u2013 such as ibuprofen or naproxen steroid medication \u2013 such as prednisolone anticoagulant medicines \u2013 such as warfarin or heparin SSRI antidepressants \u2013 such as citalopram, fluoxetine or paroxetine some medications used to treat high blood pressure \u2013 such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics some medicines used to treat epilepsy \u2013 such as phenytoin other medicines containing aspirin \u2013 including cold and flu remedies where aspirin is one of the ingredients This is not a complete list. If you want to check whether a medicine is safe to take with aspirin, ask your doctor or pharmacist, or read the leaflet that comes with the medicine. There are no known interactions between aspirin and food. The risk of bleeding in the stomach may be higher if you drink alcohol while taking aspirin, so you may want to consider reducing how much you drink or avoiding alcohol completely. Missed or extra doses If you're taking aspirin to reduce your risk of blood clots and you forget to take a dose, take that dose as soon as you remember and then continue to take your course of aspirin as normal. If it's almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular schedule. Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one. If you think you've taken too much aspirin (overdose) and have any concerns, speak to your GP or pharmacist, or call NHS 111. Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest A&E department if you experience problems such as rapid breathing, vomiting, tinnitus, sweating, or dizziness after an overdose.

The severity of these symptoms varies from person to person. Asthma can be controlled well in most people most of the time, although some people may have more persistent problems. Occasionally, asthma symptoms can get gradually or suddenly worse. This is known as an \"asthma attack\", although doctors sometimes use the term \"exacerbation\". Severe attacks may require hospital treatment and can be life threatening, although this is unusual. Speak to your GP if you think you or your child may have asthma. You should also talk to your doctor or asthma nurse if you have been diagnosed with asthma and you are finding it difficult to control your symptoms.

Asthma is caused by inflammation of the small tubes, called bronchi, which carry air in and out of the lungs. If you have asthma, the bronchi will be inflamed and more sensitive than normal. When you come into contact with something that irritates your lungs \u2013 known as a trigger \u2013 your airways become narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus (phlegm). Common asthma triggers include: house dust mites animal fur pollen cigarette smoke exercise viral infections Asthma may also be triggered by substances (allergens or chemicals) inhaled while at work. Speak to your GP if you think your symptoms are worse at work and get better on holiday. The reason why some people develop asthma is not fully understood, although it is known that you are more likely to develop it if you have a family history of the condition. Asthma can develop at any age, including in young children and elderly people. Read more about the causes of asthma.   Who is affected? In the UK, around 5.4 million people are currently receiving treatment for asthma. That's the equivalent of 1 in every 12 adults and 1 in every 11 children. Asthma in adults is more common in women than men. How asthma is treated While there is no cure for asthma, there are a number of treatments that can help control the condition. Treatment is based on two important goals, which are: relieving symptoms  preventing future symptoms and attacks For most people, this will involve the occasional \u2013 or, more commonly, daily \u2013 use of medications, usually taken using an inhaler. However, identifying and avoiding possible triggers is also important. You should have a personal asthma action plan agreed with your doctor or nurse that includes information about the medicines you need to take, how to recognise when your symptoms are getting worse, and what steps to take when they do so. Read more about treating asthma and living with asthma. Outlook For many people, asthma is a long-term condition \u2013 particularly if it first develops in adulthood. Asthma symptoms are usually controllable and reversible with treatment, although some people with long-lasting asthma may develop permanent narrowing of their airways and more persistent problems.   For children diagnosed with asthma, the condition may disappear or improve during the teenage years, although it can return later in life. Moderate or severe childhood asthma is more likely to persist or return later on.

It's often used to help diagnose and monitor asthma. A peak flow test involves blowing as hard as you can into a small, hand-held device called a peak flow meter. These are available on prescription or can be bought from most pharmacies. This page covers: Why peak flow is measured How to measure your peak flow Your peak flow score What to do if you peak flow is low Why peak flow is measured By measuring how fast you're able to breathe out, your peak flow score can indicate whether your airways are narrowed. This could be a sign that you have asthma, although other tests such as spirometry will often be needed to confirm the diagnosis. If you've already been diagnosed with asthma, measuring your peak flow regularly can be a useful way of monitoring your condition. Your score can show whether or not your condition is getting worse. It can also check if your medication is working, and indicate whether you're having an asthma attack. Measuring your peak flow before and after exposure to a possible asthma trigger, such as something you're allergic to or a substance you're exposed to at work, may also show if anything in particular causes your symptoms. How to measure your peak flow The first time your peak flow is measured, you'll be taught how to do it by a doctor or nurse. Thereafter, they may advise you to carry out the test regularly at home using your own peak flow meter. To measure your peak flow: find a comfortable position, either sitting or standing ensure the meter is set to \"0\", your fingers are not obstructing the measurement scale, and the meter is held horizontally breathe in as deeply as you can and place your lips tightly around the mouthpiece breathe out as quickly and as hard as you can when you've finished breathing out, make a note of your reading This should be repeated three times, and the highest of the three measurements should be recorded as your peak flow score. If you're monitoring your asthma at home, you may have a diary or chart to record your score. You can download a peak flow diary (PDF, 2.2Mb) from the Asthma UK website if you don't have one. Your peak flow score Your peak flow score \u2013 also known as your peak expiratory flow (PEF) \u2013 will be displayed on the side of your peak flow meter. This is given in litres of air breathed out per minute (l\/min). What's considered a normal score depends on your age, height and gender. To help diagnose asthma, your result can be compared to what would usually be expected for someone of your age, height and gender. A significant difference between your score and a normal score, or a difference in your scores in the morning and evening or when your symptoms are good and bad, may suggest you have asthma. If you're monitoring your asthma at home, your score should be compared to your best result at a point when your condition was well controlled. A big difference between your current and best score could be a sign that your condition is becoming poorly controlled or that you're having an asthma attack. What to do if your peak flow is low If you have a personal asthma action plan, it might say what you should do when your peak flow score falls to a certain level. You may just need to use one of your inhalers, or you may need to seek medical help. See treating asthma and what to do if you have an asthma attack for more information. Speak to your GP or asthma nurse if you've been diagnosed with asthma and don't have a personal action plan, or if you're concerned about your peak flow score and don't know what to do. You can download a personal action plan (PDF, 681kb) that you can fill in with your doctor or nurse from the Asthma UK website.

It occurs when the cornea or lens isn't a perfectly curved shape. Many people who wear glasses have some degree of astigmatism. Astigmatism belongs to a group of related eye conditions known as refractive errors. Other common refractive errors include: short-sightedness (myopia) long-sightedness (hypermetropia) If you have astigmatism, it's likely you'll also have one of these conditions. Left untreated, astigmatism can cause headaches, eye strain and fatigue (tiredness), particularly after doing tasks that involve focusing on something for long periods, such as reading or using a computer. What causes astigmatism? Astigmatism is usually the result of an irregular-shaped cornea or lens. The cornea is the transparent layer of tissue at the front of the eye. The cornea should be regularly curved like the surface of a football, but in cases of astigmatism it has an irregular curve, more like the shape of a rugby ball. This means that light rays entering the eye aren't focused properly, creating a blurred image. In most cases, astigmatism is present at birth. However, it sometimes develops after an eye injury or as a complication of an eye operation. Read more about the causes of astigmatism. Types of astigmatism There are two types of astigmatism \u2013 regular and irregular. Regular astigmatism is where the cornea is curved more in one direction than the other. It's more common than irregular astigmatism and can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. Irregular astigmatism is where the curvature of the cornea isn't even across the surface of the eye. Instead of being curved mostly in one direction, it could be curved in multiple directions, or the curve could be steeper towards the bottom. Irregular astigmatism is often the result of an eye injury that causes a scar to develop on the cornea. It can't be corrected with glasses, but it can be corrected with contact lenses. Diagnosing astigmatism Astigmatism is usually diagnosed after a routine eye test. It's very important for you and your children to have regular eye tests because astigmatism sometimes goes undiagnosed for years, and it can affect your or your child's ability to read and concentrate. Read more about diagnosing astigmatism. Treating astigmatism In many cases, the symptoms of astigmatism are so mild that treatment isn't needed to correct your vision. In cases where your vision is significantly affected by astigmatism, glasses or contact lenses can be used to correct it. In adults, laser treatment can also be used to permanently correct astigmatism. However, it's unlikely you'll be able to receive laser treatment through the NHS. Read more about treating astigmatism. In many cases, astigmatism is mild and treatment isn't required  Page last reviewed: 17\/10\/2014 Next review due: 17\/10\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Any part of the body can be affected, but people with ataxia often have difficulties with: balance and walking speaking swallowing tasks that require a high degree of control, such as writing and eating vision  The exact symptoms and their severity vary depending on the type of ataxia a person has. Types of ataxia There are many different types of ataxia, which can be divided into three broad categories: acquired ataxia \u2013 where symptoms develop as the result of trauma, a stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), a brain tumour, nutritional deficiencies, or other problems that damage the brain or nervous system hereditary ataxia \u2013 where symptoms develop slowly over many years and are caused by faulty genes that a person inherits from their parents; the most common type is Friedreich's ataxia idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOCA) \u2013 where the brain is progressively damaged over time for reasons that are unclear Read more about the main types of ataxia. What causes ataxia? Ataxia usually results from damage to a part of the brain called the cerebellum, but it can also be caused by damage to other parts of the nervous system. This damage can be part of an underlying condition such as MS, or can be caused by a head injury, lack of oxygen to the brain, or long-term, excessive alcohol consumption. Hereditary ataxia is caused by a faulty gene passed on by family members, who may or may not be affected. Read more about the causes of ataxia. How ataxia is treated In most cases, there's no cure for ataxia and supportive treatment to control the symptoms is necessary. This may include: speech and language therapy to help with speech and swallowing problems physiotherapy to help with movement problems occupational therapy to help you cope with the day-to-day problems medication to control muscle, bladder, heart and eye problems In a few cases, it's possible to improve ataxia or stop it getting worse by treating the underlying cause. Read more about treating ataxia. Outlook The outlook for ataxia can vary considerably and largely depends on the type of ataxia you have. Some types may remain relatively stable or even improve with time, but most will get progressively worse over many years. Life expectancy is generally shorter than normal for people with hereditary ataxia, although some people can live well into their 50s, 60s or beyond. In more severe cases, the condition can be fatal in childhood or early adulthood. For acquired ataxia, the outlook depends on the underlying cause. Some cases may improve or stay the same, while other cases may get gradually worse over time and reduce life expectancy. Information about you If you have ataxia, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

These plaques cause the arteries to harden and narrow, restricting the blood flow and oxygen supply to vital organs, and increasing the risk of blood clots that could potentially block the flow of blood to the heart or brain. Atherosclerosis doesn't tend to have any symptoms at first, and many people may be unaware they have it, but it can eventually cause life-threatening problems such as heart attacks and strokes if it gets worse. However, the condition is largely preventable with a healthy lifestyle, and treatment can help reduce the risk of serious problems occurring. This page covers: Health risks Who's at risk Tests and diagnosis Reduce your risk Treatments Health risks of atherosclerosis If left to get worse, atherosclerosis can potentially lead to a number of serious conditions known as cardiovascular disease (CVD). There won't usually be any symptoms until CVD develops. Types of CVD include: coronary heart disease \u2013 the main arteries that supply your heart (the coronary arteries) become clogged with plaques angina \u2013 short periods of tight, dull or heavy chest pain caused by coronary heart disease, which may precede a heart attack heart attacks \u2013 where the blood supply to your heart is blocked, causing sudden crushing or indigestion-like chest pain that can radiate to nearby areas, as well as shortness of breath and dizziness strokes \u2013 where the blood supply to your brain is interrupted, causing the face to droop to one side, weakness on one side of the body, and slurred speech transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) \u2013 where there are temporary symptoms of a stroke peripheral arterial disease \u2013 where the blood supply to your legs is blocked, causing leg pain when walking Click on the links above for more information about these conditions, including what the main symptoms and risks are. Who's at risk of atherosclerosis? Exactly why and how arteries become clogged is unclear. It can happen to anyone, although the following things can increase your risk: increasing age smoking an unhealthy, high-fat diet lack of exercise being overweight or obese regularly drinking excessive amounts of alcohol other conditions, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes a family history of atherosclerosis and CVD being of south Asian, African or African-Caribbean descent You can't do anything about some of these factors, but by tackling things such as an unhealthy diet and a lack of exercise, you can help reduce your risk of atherosclerosis and CVD. Read more about the risk factors for CVD. Testing for atherosclerosis Speak to your GP if you're worried you may be at a high risk of atherosclerosis. If you're between the ages of 40 and 74, you should have an NHS Health Check every five years, which will include tests to find out if you're at risk of atherosclerosis and CVD. Your GP or practice nurse can work out your level of risk by taking into account factors such as: your age, gender and ethnic group your weight and height if you smoke or have previously smoked if you have a family history of CVD your blood pressure and cholesterol levels if you have certain long-term conditions Depending on your result, you may be advised to make lifestyle changes, consider taking medication, or have further tests to check for atherosclerosis and CVD. Reduce your risk of atherosclerosis Making healthy lifestyle changes can reduce your risk of developing atherosclerosis and may help stop it getting worse. The main ways you can reduce your risk are: stop smoking \u2013 you can call the NHS Smokefree helpline for advice on 0300 123 1044 or ask your GP about stop smoking treatments; read more advice about stopping smoking  have a healthy diet \u2013 avoid foods that are high in saturated fats, salt or sugar, and aim to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day; read more healthy diet advice exercise regularly \u2013 aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity such as cycling or fast walking every week, and strength exercises on at least two days a week maintain a healthy weight \u2013 aim for a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 24.9; use the BMI calculator to work out your BMI and read advice about losing weight moderate your alcohol consumption \u2013 men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 alcohol units a week; get tips on cutting down on alcohol Click on the links above for more information. You can also read more specific advice about preventing CVD. Treatments for atherosclerosis There aren't currently any treatments that can reverse atherosclerosis, but the healthy lifestyle changes suggested above may help stop it getting worse. Sometimes additional treatment to reduce the risk of problems like heart attacks and strokes may also be recommended, such as: statins for high cholesterol \u2013 read more about treating high cholesterol medicines for high blood pressure \u2013 read more about treating high blood pressure medicines to reduce the risk of blood clots \u2013 such as low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel dietary changes and medication for diabetes \u2013 read more about treating type 1 diabetes and treating type 2 diabetes a procedure to widen or bypass an affected artery \u2013 such as a coronary angioplasty, a coronary artery bypass graft, or a carotid endarterectomy Click on the links above for more information about what these treatments involve.

The affected skin may be itchy, red, scaly, dry, cracked or blistered. It's not usually serious, but should be treated to stop it spreading to other parts of the body or other people. Treatment usually involves pharmacy-bought creams, sprays or liquids and good foot hygiene. The medical name for athlete's foot is tinea pedis. Signs and symptoms of athlete's foot Athlete's foot most commonly affects the skin between the toes or on the bottom of the feet. Affected areas of skin may be: dry, red, scaly and flaky white, soggy and cracked itchy sore covered in small blisters The infection can spread around your foot and to your toenails \u2013 read more about fungal nail infections. Scratching the infected skin and then touching other parts of your body can also spread the infection. In severe cases, skin damaged by athlete's foot can become infected with bacteria. This can lead to cellulitis, which causes the skin to become red, hot and swollen. How do you get athlete's foot? Athlete's foot is caused by fungi growing and multiplying on the skin. The fungi that cause the infection thrive in warm, dark and moist places like feet. You're more likely to get athlete's foot if you: don't keep your feet clean and dry wear shoes that cause your feet to get hot and sweaty walk around barefoot in places where fungal infections can spread easily, such as communal showers, locker rooms and gyms share towels, socks and shoes with other people have a weakened immune system have certain other health conditions, such as diabetes Athlete's foot can easily spread to other people by touching infected skin or coming into contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. Treatments for athlete's foot Athlete's foot is unlikely to get better on its own. It can usually be treated using antifungal treatments available from pharmacies without needing to see a GP. Antifungal treatments work by stopping the fungus causing your athlete's foot from growing. They come in creams, sprays, liquids and powders, and are used in the following way: treatment should be applied directly to the affected skin and surrounding area wash and dry the affected skin before applying the treatment, and clean your hands afterwards continue treatment after the rash has cleared, as described in the leaflet that comes with your medicine, to make sure all the fungus has gone Antifungal treatments are similarly effective, although some work faster than others. A pharmacist can recommend an antifungal medicine that's safe for you to use. Not all types are suitable for children, older people, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. If your rash is very sore and itchy, a pharmacist may recommend using a mild steroid cream to ease any discomfort, but this should only be used for a short period and in combination with antifungal treatment. Contact your GP if your athlete's foot doesn't start to improve after a week of treatment, or if it's causing significant pain or discomfort. Your GP may take a small skin sample for testing and recommend stronger antifungal medicines, including tablets. It's also important to practise good foot hygiene during treatment to speed up recovery and prevent athlete's foot returning. Preventing athlete's foot You can reduce your risk of developing athlete's foot by: drying your feet gently but thoroughly after washing them, particularly the areas between your toes wearing cotton socks and roomy shoes made of natural materials such as leather \u2013 this can allow your feet to \"breathe\" wear a fresh pair of socks, tights or stockings every day change your shoes every couple of days \u2013 this allows them to dry out between uses not walking around barefoot in public showers and locker rooms not sharing towels, socks and shoes with other people, and ensuring your towels are washed regularly  using talcum powder on your feet to stop them getting sweaty not using moisturiser between your toes, as this can help fungi multiply If you or your child develops athlete's foot, there's no need to stay off work or school. Follow the advice above to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.

It mainly affects children, but can also affect adults. Eczema is a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. It is a long-term (chronic) condition in most people, although it can improve over time, especially in children. Atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, but the most common areas to be affected are: backs or fronts of the knees outside or inside of the elbows around the neck hands cheeks scalp People with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups). Read more about the symptoms of atopic eczema and diagnosing atopic eczema. What causes atopic eczema? The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it's clear it's not down to one single thing. It often occurs in people who get allergies \u2013 \"atopic\" means sensitivity to allergens. It can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever. The symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather. Sometimes food allergies can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema. Read more about the causes of atopic eczema. Treating atopic eczema  There is currently no cure for atopic eczema, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time. However, severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life and may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally. There is also an increased risk of skin infections.  Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including: self care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers emollients (moisturising treatments) \u2013 used on a daily basis for dry skin  topical corticosteroids \u2013 used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups Read more about treating atopic eczema and the complications of atopic eczema. Who is affected? About one in five children in the UK has atopic eczema. In 8 out of 10 cases, the condition develops before a child reaches the age of five. Many children develop it before their first birthday. Atopic eczema can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older. About half of all cases improve a lot by the time a child reaches 11 years, and around two-thirds improve by the age of 16. However, the condition can continue into adulthood and can sometimes develop for the first time in adults. Other types of eczema Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin. Other types of eczema include: discoid eczema \u2013 a type of eczema that occurs in circular or oval patches on the skin contact dermatitis \u2013 a type of eczema that occurs when the body comes into contact with a particular substance varicose eczema \u2013 a type of eczema that most often affects the lower legs and is caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins seborrhoeic eczema \u2013 a type of eczema where red, scaly patches develop on the sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears and scalp dyshidrotic eczema (pompholyx) \u2013 a type of eczema that causes tiny blisters to erupt across the palms of the hands Page last reviewed: 25\/11\/2014 Next review due: 25\/11\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

A normal heart rate should be regular and between 60 and 100 beats a minute when you're resting. You can measure your heart rate by feeling the pulse in your neck or wrist. In atrial fibrillation, the heart rate is irregular and can sometimes be very fast. In some cases, it can be considerably higher than 100 beats a minute. This can cause problems including dizziness, shortness of breath and tiredness. You may be aware of noticeable heart palpitations, where your heart feels like it's pounding, fluttering or beating irregularly, often for a few seconds or, in some cases, a few minutes.    Sometimes, atrial fibrillation doesn't cause any symptoms and a person with it is completely unaware that their heart rate isn't regular. Read more about the symptoms of atrial fibrillation. When to see your GP You should make an appointment to see your GP if: you notice a sudden change in your heartbeat your heart rate is consistently lower than 60 or above 100 \u2013 particularly if you're experiencing other symptoms of atrial fibrillation, such as dizziness and shortness of breath    See your GP as soon as possible if you have chest pain. What causes atrial fibrillation? When the heart beats normally, its muscular walls contract (tighten and squeeze) to force blood out and around the body. They then relax, so the heart can fill with blood again. This process is repeated every time the heart beats. In atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers (atria) contract randomly and sometimes so fast that the heart muscle can't relax properly between contractions. This reduces the heart's efficiency and performance. Atrial fibrillation occurs when abnormal electrical impulses suddenly start firing in the atria. These impulses override the heart's natural pacemaker, which can no longer control the rhythm of the heart. This causes you to have a highly irregular pulse rate. The cause isn't fully understood, but it tends to occur in certain groups of people (see below) and may be triggered by certain situations, such as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol or smoking. Read more about the causes of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation can be defined in various ways, depending on the degree to which it affects you. For example: paroxysmal atrial fibrillation \u2013 episodes come and go, and usually stop within 48 hours without any treatment persistent atrial fibrillation \u2013 each episode lasts for longer than seven days (or less when it's treated) long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation \u2013 this means you have had continuous atrial fibrillation for a year or longer permanent atrial fibrillation \u2013 atrial fibrillation is present all the time  Who's affected? Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disturbance, affecting around one million people in the UK. Atrial fibrillation can affect adults of any age, but it becomes more common as you get older. It affects about 7 in 100 people aged over 65, and more men than women have it.  Atrial fibrillation is more likely to occur in people with other conditions, such as high blood pressure (hypertension), atherosclerosis, or a heart valve problem. Treating atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation isn't usually life-threatening, but it can be uncomfortable and often requires treatment. Treatment may involve:  medication to prevent a stroke (people with atrial fibrillation are more at risk of having a stroke) medication to control the heart rate or rhythm cardioversion \u2013 where the heart is given a controlled electric shock to restore normal rhythm catheter ablation \u2013 where the area inside the heart that's causing the abnormal heart rhythm is destroyed using radiofrequency energy; you may then need to have a pacemaker fitted to help your heart beat regularly Read more about treating atrial fibrillation and the possible complications of atrial fibrillation. Information about you If you have atrial fibrillation, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).

Atrial flutter Atrial flutter is less common than atrial fibrillation, but shares the same symptoms, causes and possible complications. Around a third of people with atrial flutter also have atrial fibrillation. Atrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation, but the rhythm in the atria is more organised and less chaotic than the abnormal patterns caused by atrial fibrillation. Treatment for atrial flutter is also slightly different, because catheter ablation (see above) is considered to be the best treatment, whereas medication is often the first treatment used for atrial fibrillation.

Symptoms of ADHD tend to be noticed at an early age and may become more noticeable when a child's circumstances change, such as when they start school. Most cases are diagnosed when children are 6 to 12 years old. The symptoms of ADHD usually improve with age, but many adults who are diagnosed with the condition at a young age continue to experience problems. People with ADHD may also have additional problems, such as sleep and anxiety disorders. Read more about the symptoms of ADHD. Getting help  Many children go through phases where they're restless or inattentive. This is often completely normal and doesn't necessarily mean they have ADHD. However, you should consider raising your concerns with your child's teacher, their school's special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) or GP if you think their behaviour may be different to most children their age. It's also a good idea to speak to your GP if you're an adult and you think you may have ADHD, but you weren't diagnosed with the condition as a child. Read more about diagnosing ADHD. What causes ADHD? The exact cause of ADHD is unknown, but the condition has been shown to run in families. Research has also identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD compared to those who don't have the condition. Other factors that have been suggested as potentially having a role in ADHD include: being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) having a low birthweight smoking, alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy ADHD is more common in boys than girls. It's thought that around 2% to 5% of school-aged children may have the condition. ADHD can occur in people of any intellectual ability, although it's more common in people with learning difficulties. Read more about the causes of ADHD. How ADHD is treated Although there's no cure for ADHD, it can be managed with appropriate educational support, advice and support for parents and affected children, alongside medication, if necessary. Medication is often the first treatment offered to adults with ADHD, although psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may also help. Read more about treating ADHD. Living with ADHD Looking after a child with ADHD can be challenging, but it's important to remember that they can't help their behaviour. Some issues that may arise in day-to-day life include: getting your child to sleep at night getting ready for school on time listening to and carrying out instructions being organised social occasions shopping Adults with ADHD may also find they have similar problems, and some may have issues with drugs, crime and employment. Read about living with ADHD for information on ways to cope with these issues.

What's the best way of dealing with an active child? (9 to 30 months) Media last reviewed: 17\/01\/2015 Next review due: 17\/01\/2017 Young children like to be active, and it's normal for them to have lots of energy. Keeping babies and toddlers active every day is good for their health. Looking after a child who is always on the go can be tiring and stressful, but there are things you can do to make life easier for both of you. Tips for daily life with a very active child keep to a daily routine \u2013 routine can help if your child is restless or difficult; it can also help you stay calm and cope with the strain dedicate time to your child \u2013 since your child may be demanding your attention for most of the day (and sometimes at night, too) you'll often have to say no to them; that will be easier to do and easier for your child to accept if there are times each day when you give them all your attention avoid difficult situations \u2013 for example, keep shopping trips short try to go out every day \u2013 go to a park, playground or other safe, open space where your child can run around and use up energy set small goals \u2013 help your child to sit still or be controlled, and encourage them to concentrate for a very short time, then gradually build it up; remember, you can't transform your child's behaviour overnight Many children seem overactive, but only about 2% of children in the UK have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is what used to be known as hyperactivity. The challenge for parents and health professionals is to recognise the difference between the normal energy levels of a young child and ADHD symptoms. Identifying ADHD early is important to make sure your child gets the support they need. If you are worried about your child's behaviour, talk to your health visitor or GP.

Why are hearing tests needed? Hearing tests are carried out for two main reasons: as a routine part of a baby\u2019s or young child\u2019s developmental checks to check the hearing of someone who is experiencing hearing problems or has hearing loss It's important hearing tests are carried out so the right support and treatment can be provided. Hearing tests are carried out at regular intervals during childhood, starting with the Newborn Hearing Screening Programme (NHSP) within a few weeks of birth. Your child's hearing may also be checked during a general health review when they are a few years old and before they start school for the first time. If you're worried about any hearing problems, you can ask your GP for a hearing test. Read more about when hearing tests are needed. What happens during a hearing test? Although your GP or practice nurse can examine your ears, you will usually be referred to a specialist for a hearing test. A number of different tests are used to check how well the ears are functioning and their ability to detect different levels of sound. Common hearing tests include: automated otoacoustic emissions (AOAE) tests \u2013 a computer attached to an earpiece plays clicking noises and measures the response from the ear automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) tests \u2013 sensors are placed on the head and neck to check the response of the nerves to sound played through headphones pure tone audiometry tests \u2013 sounds of different volumes and frequencies are played, usually through headphones, and a button is pressed when they are heard bone conduction tests \u2013 a vibrating noise generator sensor is placed behind the ear and presses on the bone to test how well the hearing nerve is working Generally, different tests are used for adults and children but they are all completely painless. The results of some of these tests are recorded on a graph called an audiogram, so that the type of hearing loss can be identified. Read more about: how hearing tests are carried out hearing tests for children  Hearing problems The ear is made up of three main areas: the outer ear \u2013 sound enters the outer ear and passes down the ear canal to the eardrum (a thin membrane), which vibrates the middle ear \u2013 this air-filled cavity contains three tiny bones that pick up and carry the vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear the inner ear \u2013 this contains the vestibular system (the balance organ) and the cochlea (the hearing organ), which is a coiled fluid-filled tube that turns the vibrations into electrical signals that are fed along the auditory nerve to the brain A problem in any of these areas will require a hearing test to determine the type of hearing loss you have. Conductive hearing loss Your hearing may be affected if sounds don't reach the inner ear efficiently. This is known as conductive hearing loss. Conductive hearing loss can be caused by problems such as: a blockage in your ear canal, such as a build-up of earwax a blockage in the middle ear \u2013 for example, glue ear an infection of your outer ear (otitis externa) or middle ear (otitis media) a hole or tear in the eardrum (perforated eardrum) otosclerosis, which is an abnormal growth of bone in the middle ear disruption of your hearing bones caused by injury or disease Conductive hearing loss caused by these problems is often temporary and reversible. Sensori-neural hearing loss If sounds reach the inner ear but are still not heard, the fault lies in the inner ear or (rarely) in the hearing nerve. This is called sensori-neural hearing loss. Sensori-neural hearing loss may occur for a number of reasons, most commonly as a result of age-related change. This sort of hearing loss is nearly always permanent.

It can affect your ability to: pinpoint where a sound is coming from tell which sound comes before another distinguish similar sounds from one another \u2013 such as \"seventy\" and \"seventeen\" understand speech \u2013 particularly if there's background noise, more than one person speaking, the person is speaking quickly, or the sound quality is poor remember instructions you've been told enjoy music Children with the problem may also have difficulty responding to sounds, understanding things they're told, concentrating, and expressing themselves with speech. Their reading and spelling may also be affected. Many people find the condition becomes less of an issue over time as they develop the skills to deal with it. Children may need extra help and support at school, but they can be just as successful as their classmates. Who is affected? Auditory processing disorder affects people of all ages. Many cases start in childhood, although it sometimes can develop in adults. Children with auditory processing disorder may have noticeable problems from a very young age, although sometimes the symptoms might not be obvious or only become apparent later on when they start school, college, university or a new job. It's not clear exactly how many people have auditory processing disorder, but it's thought up to 1 in every 20 children may have it to some degree. What causes auditory processing disorder? Exactly what causes auditory processing disorder isn't fully understood. Sometimes a possible underlying factor is identified, but not always. In children, the condition may occur after a persistent hearing problem at a young age, such as glue ear, which has since passed but has had a permanent effect on how the brain processes sound. It may also be caused by a genetic defect, as some cases seem to run in families. In adults and children, the condition may be associated with damage to the brain from a head injury, stroke, brain tumour or meningitis. Some cases in adults have also been linked to age-related changes in the ability of the brain to process sounds and progressive conditions affecting the nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis. How your GP can help You should visit your GP if you think you or your child may have a hearing problem such as auditory processing disorder. They may refer you to an audiologist (hearing specialist) for some tests. The tests used may include: hearing tests \u2013 you or your child will be asked to listen to a variety of sounds and respond to them questionnaires \u2013 you or your child may be asked questions such as, \"If a friend or family member shouts your name, do you know who is calling without looking to see?\"  electrode tests \u2013 an earbud or headphones are placed in your ear and electrodes are placed on your head to measure your brain's response to sound speech and language assessments and cognitive (thinking) assessments Once auditory processing disorder is diagnosed, you'll be advised about ways you can adapt to the problem. How auditory processing disorder is managed There's currently no cure for auditory processing disorder, but there are a number of strategies that can help you cope with the condition. Some of these are outlined below. Auditory training You may be advised to try special activities to help train your brain to analyse sound better, known as auditory training. This can be done either on your own, with a professional, or with the help of a computer programme or CD. It can involve a range of tasks, such as identifying sounds and guessing where they're coming from or trying to focus on specific sounds when there's some slight background noise. The tasks can be adapted for people of different ages, with children often learning through games or from reading with their parents. Changes at home or school Be aware of room acoustics and how they affect you. Rooms with hard surfaces will cause echoes, so rooms with carpets and soft furnishings are best. Switch off any radios or televisions and move away from any noisy devices such as fans. If your child has problems hearing, talk to their school about changes that may help them, such as sitting near the teacher, using visual aids and reducing background noise. Your child may also benefit from wearing a radio receiver or having a speaker on their desk at school, which is connected wirelessly to a small microphone worn by their teacher. Alternatively, a speaker system in the class that's connected to the teacher's microphone may help your child hear their teacher over any background noise. Help from others It may be useful to tell other people about your hearing problems and let them know what they can do to help you hear more clearly. Ask them to: make sure they get your attention and face you before they talk speak clearly and a little more slowly than normal emphasise their speech to highlight the key points of the message repeat or rephrase the message if necessary   Further information For more information on what you can do to help yourself and how others can help you, you might find the following leaflets helpful: University College London Hospitals NHS Trust: a guide to help your auditory perception (PDF, 305kb) Action on Hearing Loss: children and auditory processing disorder (PDF, 194kb) Page last reviewed: 20\/05\/2015 Next review due: 20\/05\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

In children with ASD, the symptoms are present before three years of age, although a diagnosis can sometimes be made after the age of three. It's estimated that about 1 in every 100 people in the UK has ASD. More boys are diagnosed with the condition than girls. There's no \"cure\" for ASD, but speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, educational support, plus a number of other interventions are available to help children and parents. Read about help and support available for people with ASD. Signs and symptoms People with ASD tend to have problems with social interaction and communication. In early infancy, some children with ASD don\u2019t babble or use other vocal sounds. Older children have problems using non-verbal behaviours to interact with others \u2013 for example, they have difficulty with eye contact, facial expressions, body language and gestures. They may give no or brief eye contact and ignore familiar or unfamiliar people. Children with ASD may also lack awareness of and interest in other children. They\u2019ll often either gravitate to older or younger children, rather than interacting with children of the same age. They tend to play alone. They can find it hard to understand other people's emotions and feelings, and have difficulty starting conversations or taking part in them properly. Language development may be delayed, and a child with ASD won\u2019t compensate their lack of language or delayed language skills by using gestures (body language) or facial expressions. Children with ASD will tend to repeat words or phrases spoken by others (either immediately or later) without formulating their own language, or in parallel to developing their language skills. Some children don\u2019t demonstrate imaginative or pretend play, while others will continually repeat the same pretend play. Some children with ASD like to stick to the same routine and little changes may trigger tantrums. Some children may flap their hand or twist or flick their fingers when they\u2019re excited or upset. Others may engage in repetitive activity, such as turning light switches on and off, opening and closing doors, or lining things up. Children and young people with ASD frequently experience a range of cognitive (thinking), learning, emotional and behavioural problems. For example, they may also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, or depression. About 70% of children with ASD have a non-verbal IQ below 70. Of these, 50% have a non-verbal IQ below 50. Overall, up to 50% of people with \"severe learning difficulties\" have an ASD. Read more about the symptoms of ASD. Getting a diagnosis The main features of ASD \u2013 problems with social communication and interaction \u2013 can often be recognised during early childhood. Some features of ASD may not become noticeable until a change of situation, such as when the child starts nursery or school. See your GP or health visitor if you notice any of the signs and symptoms of ASD in your child, or if you're concerned about your child's development. It can also be helpful to discuss your concerns with your child's nursery or school. Read more about diagnosing ASD. Caring for someone with ASD Being a carer isn't an easy role. When you're busy responding to the needs of others, it can affect your emotional and physical energy, and make it easy to forget your own health and mental wellbeing. If you're caring for someone else, it's important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It's in your best interests and those of the person you care for. Read more about care and support, including information on: carers' assessments support and the benefits carers are entitled to carers' breaks and respite care You can also call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053. What causes ASD? The exact cause of ASD is unknown, but it's thought that several complex genetic and environmental factors are involved. In the past, some people believed the MMR vaccine caused ASD, but this has been investigated extensively in a number of major studies around the world, involving millions of children, and researchers have found no evidence of a link between MMR and ASD. Read more about the causes of ASD. Autism in adults Some people with ASD had features of the condition as a child, but enter adulthood without ever being diagnosed. However, getting a diagnosis as an adult can often help a person with ASD and their families understand the condition, and work out what type of advice and support they need. For example, a number of autism-specific services are available that provide adults with ASD with the help and support they need to live independently and find a job that matches their skills and abilities.

The aim of a post-mortem is to determine the cause of death. Post-mortems are carried out by pathologists (doctors who specialise in understanding the nature and causes of disease). The Royal College of Pathologists and the Human Tissue Authority (HTA) set the standards pathologists work to. Post-mortems provide useful information about how, when and why someone died, and they enable pathologists to obtain a better understanding of how diseases spread. Learning more about illnesses and medical conditions benefits patients too, because it means they'll receive more effective treatment in the future. If your child, partner or relative has died and a post-mortem is to be carried out, hospital bereavement officers can offer you support and advice. They also act as the main point of contact between you and the staff carrying out the post-mortem. When post-mortems are carried out A post-mortem examination will be carried out if it's been requested by: a coroner \u2013 because the cause of death is unknown, or following a sudden, violent or unexpected death a hospital doctor \u2013 to find out more about an illness or the cause of death, or to further medical research and understanding The two different types of post-mortem are discussed below. Coroner\u2019s post-mortem examination A coroner is a judicial officer responsible for investigating deaths in certain situations (see below). Coroners are usually lawyers or doctors with a minimum of five years' experience. In most cases, a doctor or the police refer a death to the coroner. A death will be referred to the coroner if: it's unexpected, such as the sudden death of a baby (cot death) it's violent, unnatural or suspicious, such as a suicide or drug overdose it's the result of an accident or injury it occurred during or soon after a hospital procedure, such as surgery the cause of death is unknown The main aim of a post-mortem requested by a coroner is to find out how someone died and decide whether an inquest is needed. An inquest is a legal investigation into the circumstances surrounding a person's death. If someone related to you has died and their death has been referred to a coroner, you won't be asked to give consent (permission) for a post-mortem to take place. This is because the coroner is required by law to carry out a post-mortem when a death is suspicious, sudden or unnatural. A coroner may decide to hold an inquest after a post-mortem has been completed. Samples of organs and tissues may need to be retained until after the inquest has finished. If the death occurred in suspicious circumstances, samples may also need to be kept by the police, as evidence, for a longer period. In some cases, samples may need to be kept for a number of months or even years. The coroner's office will discuss the situation with you if, following an inquest, tissue samples need to be retained for a certain length of time. Hospital post-mortem examination Post-mortems are sometimes requested by hospital doctors to provide more information about an illness or the cause of death, or to further medical research. Sometimes, the partner or relative of the deceased person will request a hospital post-mortem to find out more about the cause of death. Hospital post-mortems can only be carried out with consent. Sometimes, a person may have given their consent before they died. If this isn't the case, a person who is close to the deceased can give their consent for a post-mortem to take place. Hospital post-mortems may be limited to particular areas of the body, such as the head, chest or abdomen. When you're asked to give your consent, this will be discussed with you. During the post-mortem, only the organs or tissue that you've agreed to can be removed for examination. The HTA recommends that you should be given at least 24 hours to consider your decision about the post-mortem examination. You should also be given the details of someone to contact in case you change your mind. What happens during a post-mortem A post-mortem will be carried out as soon as possible, usually within two to three working days of a person's death. In some cases, it may be possible for it to take place within 24 hours. Depending upon when the examination is due to take place, you may be able to see the body before the post-mortem is carried out. The post-mortem takes place in an examination room that looks similar to an operating theatre. The examination room will be licensed and inspected by the HTA. During the procedure, the deceased person's body is opened and the organs removed for examination. A diagnosis can sometimes be made by looking at the organs. Some organs need to be examined in close detail during a post-mortem and these investigations can take several weeks to complete. The pathologist will return the organs to the body after the post-mortem has been completed. If you wish, you'll usually be able to view the body after the examination. Once release papers have been issued, the undertakers you've appointed will be able to collect the body from the mortuary in preparation for the funeral. What happens after a post-mortem After a post-mortem, the pathologist writes a report of the findings. If the post-mortem was requested by the coroner, the coroner or coroner's officer will let you know the cause of death determined by the pathologist. If you want a full copy of the pathologist's report, you can request this from the coroner's office, but there may be a fee. In some cases, the report may be sent to a hospital doctor or GP so they can discuss it with you. If the post-mortem was requested by a hospital doctor, you'll have to request the results from the hospital where the post-mortem took place. You may be charged a small fee for this. You can arrange to discuss the results with the doctor in charge of the deceased person's care while they were in hospital (if applicable), or with your GP. The HTA has produced a leaflet providing further information about what happens before, during and after the examination \u2013 Post-mortem examination: Your choices about organs and tissue (PDF, 68kb). The Human Tissue Authority The Human Tissue Authority (HTA) ensures that human tissue is used safely, ethically and with proper consent. It regulates organisations that remove, store and use tissue for research, medical treatment, post-mortem examination, teaching and public display. All premises where post-mortems are carried out must be licensed by the HTA. Bereavement support For many people, understanding the reason for a loved one's death helps them come to terms with their loss. Talking and sharing your feelings with someone can also help. Some people find that relying on the support of family and friends is the best way to cope. Your GP will be able to put you in touch with bereavement services in your area. You can also contact the national Cruse helpline on 0844 477 9400 or a local Cruse centre. Read more about bereavement and coming to terms with the death of a loved one.

Although children affected by ADPKD are born with the condition, it rarely causes any noticeable problems until the cysts grow large enough to affect the kidneys' functions. In most cases, this doesn't occur until a person is between 30 and 60 years of age. Less commonly, children or older people may have noticeable symptoms as a result of ADPKD. When ADPKD reaches this stage, it can cause a wide range of problems, including: abdominal (tummy) pain high blood pressure (hypertension)  blood in the urine (haematuria) \u2013 which may not always be noticeable to the naked eye potentially serious upper urinary tract infections (UTIs) kidney stones Kidney function will gradually deteriorate until so much is lost that kidney failure occurs. Read more about the symptoms of ADPKD and diagnosing ADPKD. What causes ADPKD? ADPKD is caused by a genetic fault that disrupts the normal development of some of the cells in the kidneys and causes cysts to grow. Faults in one of two different genes are known to cause ADPKD. The affected genes are: PKD1 \u2013 which accounts for 85% of cases PKD2 \u2013 which accounts for 15% of cases Both types of ADPKD have the same symptoms, but they tend to be more severe in PKD1. A child has a one in two (50%) chance of developing ADPKD if one of their parents has the faulty PKD1 or PKD2 gene. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rarer type of kidney disease which can only be inherited if both parents carry the faulty gene and in this type problems usually start much earlier, during childhood. Non-inherited ADPKD In around one in four (25%) cases, a person develops ADPKD without having a known family history of the condition. This could be because the condition was never diagnosed in a relative, or a relative with the condition may have died before their symptoms were recognised. In around one in 10 cases of ADPKD, the mutation develops for the first time in the affected person. It's not known what causes this to happen. The affected person can pass the faulty gene on to their children in the same way as someone who's inherited it from a parent (see above). Who's affected ADPKD is the most common inherited condition to affect the kidneys, although it's still relatively uncommon. Only around one or two in every 1,000 people are born with ADPKD, which means there are currently around 60,000 people in the UK with the condition. Treating ADPKD There's currently no cure for ADPKD, but various treatments are available to manage problems caused by the condition. Most problems \u2013 such as high blood pressure, pain and UTIs \u2013 can be treated with medication, although you may need to have an operation to remove any large kidney stones that develop. If the condition reaches a point where the kidneys aren't able to function properly, there are two main treatment options: dialysis \u2013 where a machine is used to replicate kidney functions kidney transplant \u2013 where a healthy kidney is removed from a living or recently deceased donor and implanted into someone with kidney failure In some cases of ADPKD in adults (where chronic kidney disease is advanced and progressing rapidly), a medication called tolvaptan can be used to slow down the formation of cysts and protect kidney function. Read more about treating ADPKD. Outlook The outlook for ADPKD is highly variable. Some people experience kidney failure soon after the condition is diagnosed, whereas others may live the rest of their life with their kidneys working relatively well. On average, around half of people with ADPKD require treatment for kidney failure by the time they're 60. As well as kidney failure, ADPKD can also cause a number of other potentially serious problems, such as heart attacks and strokes caused by high blood pressure, or bleeding on the brain (subarachnoid haemorrhage) caused by a bulge in the wall of a blood vessel in the brain (brain aneurysm). Read more about the complications of ADPKD. Information about you If you have ADPKD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. The kidneys The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs located on either side of the back of the body, just underneath the ribcage. The main role of the kidneys is to filter out waste products from the blood and pass them out of the body in urine. The kidneys also play an important role in: helping to maintain blood pressure at a healthy level keeping salt and water in balance making hormones needed for the production of blood and bone Page last reviewed: 11\/05\/2016 Next review due: 11\/05\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Over time, either one of these organs may fail. The condition often causes serious problems soon after birth, although less severe cases may not become obvious until a child is older. ARPKD can cause a wide range of problems, including: underdeveloped lungs, which can cause severe breathing difficulties soon after birth high blood pressure (hypertension) excessive peeing and thirst problems with blood flow through the liver, which can lead to serious internal bleeding a progressive loss of kidney function, known as chronic kidney disease (CKD)  When these problems develop, and how severe they are, can vary considerably \u2013 even between family members with the condition. Read more about the symptoms of ARPKD and diagnosing ARPKD. Even though ARPKD is rare, it's one of the most common kidney problems to affect young children. It's estimated that around 1 in 20,000 babies is born with the condition. Both boys and girls are affected equally. What causes ARPKD? ARPKD is caused by a genetic fault that disrupts normal development of the kidneys and liver. In particular, the growth and development of the small tubes that make up the kidneys is affected, causing bulges and cysts (fluid-filled sacs) to develop within them. Over time, the cysts cause the kidneys to become enlarged and scarred (fibrosis), resulting in the deterioration of overall kidney function. Similar problems also affect the small tubes (bile ducts) that allow bile (a digestive fluid) to flow out of the liver. The bile ducts may develop abnormally and cysts may grow inside them. The liver can also become scarred over time. ARPKD is caused by a genetic alteration in the gene PKHD1, which in most cases is passed on to a child by their parents. If both parents carry a faulty version of this gene, there's a one in four (25%) chance of each child they have developing ARPKD. The way ARPKD is inherited is different from a more common type of kidney disease called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which usually doesn't cause significantly reduced kidney function until adulthood. ADPKD can be inherited if only one parent carries one of the genetic faults responsible for the condition. Read more about the causes of ARPKD. Treating ARPKD There's currently no cure for ARPKD, but various treatments can help manage the wide range of problems it can cause. Treatment for ARPKD may include: breathing assistance with a ventilator (a machine that moves air in and out of the lungs) for children with severe breathing difficulties medication to treat high blood pressure procedures to stop any internal bleeding that may occur medications to control problems associated with the loss of kidney function, such as iron supplements for anaemia. More than half of all children who survive the early stages of ARPKD will eventually experience kidney failure by the time they're 15 to 20 years old. If kidney failure does occur, there are two main treatment options: dialysis \u2013 where a machine is used to replicate many functions of the kidney kidney transplant \u2013 where a healthy kidney is removed from a living or recently deceased donor and implanted into someone with kidney failure Read more about the treatment of ARPKD. Outlook The outlook for children with ARPKD can vary considerably, depending on the severity of the condition. If routine scans pick up kidney problems during pregnancy, the baby will usually have a poorer outlook than a child who's diagnosed at a later stage. However, in general, ARPKD is a severe condition and around one in three babies will die from severe breathing difficulties during the first four weeks after birth. About eight or nine out of 10 babies (80-90%) with ARPKD who survive the first month of life will live until they're at least five years old. It's difficult to predict exactly how long a child with ARPKD will live because there's very little data showing long-term survival rates. However, with advances in treatments and a better understanding of the condition, increasing numbers of children with ARPKD are living well into adulthood. Information about you If you have ARPKD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).

In rare cases, it can affect humans. There are many different strains of bird flu virus, most of which don't infect humans. However, two particular strains have caused serious concern in recent years: H5N1 (since 1997) H7N9 (since 2013) Although these viruses don't infect people easily and aren't usually transmitted from human to human, several people have been infected around the world, leading to a number of deaths. Other bird flu viruses \u2013 particularly H7N7 and H9N2, and more recently H6N1, H10N8 and H5N6 \u2013 have also infected people, but these have been very rare or only rarely caused severe illness. Bird flu affects many species of birds, including chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese. It can be passed between commercial, wild and pet birds. Birds don't always get sick from infection, so seemingly healthy birds may still pose a risk to people who come into contact with them. Bird flu in the UK No humans have been infected with bird flu in the UK, although plans are in place to manage any suspected cases. A few cases of bird flu were confirmed in poultry in the UK recently. In February 2015, a low-severity H7N7 strain of bird flu was confirmed at a farm in Hampshire, but restrictions around the premises were lifted 21 days later after cleaning and disinfection. Before that, in November 2014, H5N8 bird flu was confirmed at a duck breeding farm in Yorkshire, but the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the risk to public health was very low. This is because H5N8 infection was not found in humans during the recent worldwide epidemic among birds. The last reported case of H5N1 in the UK was in early 2008. You can read reports on recent cases of bird flu in the UK on the GOV.UK website. Signs and symptoms Like other types of flu, bird flu symptoms often include: a high temperature (fever) aching muscles headache respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose Diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal (tummy) pain, chest pain, and bleeding from the nose and gums have also been reported as early symptoms in some people. These symptoms can come on suddenly. The time from infection to the start of symptoms (incubation period) is usually three to five days, although in some cases it can be up to seven days. Within days of symptoms appearing, potentially fatal complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure may develop. Prompt treatment with antiviral medication may help prevent complications and reduce the risk of death. Treatment People with suspected symptoms of bird flu (avian flu) will be advised to stay at home, or will be cared for in hospital in isolation from other patients. The main recommendations are: resting drinking plenty of fluids and eating healthily taking medication to help treat fever and pain, such as aspirin and paracetamol Antiviral medication In the UK, certain antiviral medications have been stockpiled for use in the event of an outbreak. These medications work by stopping the virus multiplying in your body. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Zanamivir (Relenza) and Peramivir (Rapivab) help reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival. For regular flu, these medications are most effective if given within 48 hours of symptoms developing, but it's not clear if this is the case for bird flu. Nevertheless, they should be given as soon as possible to people suspected or proven to be infected, even if it's more than 48 hours after symptoms started. These medications may also be given as a preventative measure to people who could have been exposed to bird flu viruses \u2013 for example, other household members, healthcare workers, or people who have had close contact with infected birds. In these cases, the course of medication should begin as soon as possible after exposure to the virus and continue for 7 to 10 days after the last known exposure. Treating complications Complications such as bacterial pneumonia may develop in some people and can be treated with regular antibiotics. People who are severely affected may need to be given extra oxygen to help them breathe \u2013 for example, through a ventilator (a machine that assists with breathing). When to seek medical advice You should contact your GP or call NHS 111 immediately if you experience these symptoms and you've visited an area affected by bird flu in the last two weeks. An initial assessment can be made over the phone, at a GP surgery, at home, or in a side room at a hospital. Bird flu is diagnosed based on your symptoms and the likelihood that you've been exposed to an infected bird. The doctor will ask you whether you've: recently travelled to an area affected by bird flu and if you've been close (within one metre) to live or dead domestic fowl or wild birds, including those at bird markets had close contact (touching or speaking distance) with anyone who has a severe respiratory illness had contact with anyone who died unexpectedly and who was from an area that had an outbreak If bird flu is suspected, the following tests will be carried out to establish whether you have the infection: chest X-ray virus detection using a nose and throat swab blood tests If the laboratory tests and chest X-ray results are normal, it's unlikely you have bird flu. You can read about outbreaks of bird flu in the UK on the GOV.UK website. How bird flu spreads to humans Bird flu is spread through direct contact with infected birds (dead or alive), an infected bird's droppings, or secretions from their eyes or respiratory tract. Close and prolonged contact with an infected bird is generally required for the infection to spread to humans. For example: touching infected birds that are dead or alive inhaling or being in contact with dried dust from the droppings or bedding of infected birds inhaling or being in contact with droplets sneezed by infected birds culling, slaughtering, butchering or preparing infected poultry for cooking Another possible source of bird flu can be live markets, where birds are sold in crowded and sometimes unsanitary conditions. Avoid visiting these markets if you're travelling in countries that have had an outbreak of bird flu. Bird flu isn't transmitted through cooked food. Poultry and eggs are safe to eat in areas that have experienced outbreaks of bird flu. Preventing bird flu There are a number of things you can do to reduce your risk when you visit areas where outbreaks have been reported, such as: avoid visiting live animal markets and poultry farms avoid contact with surfaces that are contaminated with bird droppings don't pick up or touch birds (dead or alive) don't eat or handle undercooked or raw poultry, egg or duck dishes don't bring any live poultry products back to the UK, including feathers always practise good personal hygiene, such as washing your hands regularly There are no restrictions on travel to countries that have been or are currently affected by bird flu. Read more about preventing bird flu. Reporting suspected cases of bird flu Bird flu is a notifiable disease in animals and you should report any suspected case to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), even if you're not sure. Call the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) helpline on 08459 33 55 77 if you find five or more dead birds in the same place. Read about notifiable diseases in animals on the GOV.UK website. Human cases The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that by May 2015, 840 people had been infected with the H5N1 virus worldwide and 447 had died. Indonesia, Egypt and Vietnam experienced most cases and fatalities. Since March 2013, there have been reports of people being infected with the H7N9 virus, mostly in the southeastern part of mainland China. By May 2015, there had been 665 confirmed cases and 229 deaths. Most cases were among middle-aged to elderly men. A small number of cases were reported in travellers from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and Canada. For both viruses, there have been some reports of limited human to human transmission, usually as a result of very close contact between family members. People who have had bird flu generally developed the virus after coming into close and prolonged contact with infected birds. Millions of birds have been killed during outbreaks to prevent the disease spreading and being passed on to people.
