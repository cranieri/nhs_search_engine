SAD is sometimes known as \"winter depression\" because the symptoms are more apparent and tend to be more severe during the winter. The symptoms often begin in the autumn as the days start getting shorter. They're typically most severe during December, January and February. SAD often improves and disappears in the spring and summer, although it may return each autumn and winter in a repetitive pattern. Symptoms of SAD Symptoms of SAD can include: a persistent low mood a loss of pleasure or interest in normal everyday activities irritability feelings of despair, guilt and worthlessness feeling lethargic (lacking in energy) and sleepy during the day sleeping for longer than normal and finding it hard to get up in the morning craving carbohydrates and gaining weight For some people, these symptoms can be severe and have a significant impact on their day-to-day activities. Read more about the symptoms of SAD.  When to see your GP You should consider seeing your GP if you think you might have SAD and you're struggling to cope. Your GP can carry out an assessment to check your mental health. They may ask you about your mood, lifestyle, eating habits and sleeping patterns, plus any seasonal changes in your thoughts and behaviour. Read more about diagnosing SAD. What causes SAD? The exact cause of SAD isn't fully understood, but it's often linked to reduced exposure to sunlight during the shorter autumn and winter days. The main theory is that a lack of sunlight might stop a part of the brain called the hypothalamus working properly, which may affect the: production of melatonin \u2013 melatonin is a hormone that makes you feel sleepy; in people with SAD, the body may produce it in higher than normal levels production of serotonin \u2013 serotonin is a hormone that affects your mood, appetite and sleep; a lack of sunlight may lead to lower serotonin levels, which is linked to feelings of depression body's internal clock (circadian rhythm) \u2013 your body uses sunlight to time various important functions, such as when you wake up, so lower light levels during the winter may disrupt your body clock and lead to symptoms of SAD It's also possible that some people are more vulnerable to SAD as a result of their genes, as some cases appear to run in families. Treatments for SAD A range of treatments are available for SAD. Your GP will recommend the most suitable treatment programme for you. The main treatments are: lifestyle measures, including getting as much natural sunlight as possible, exercising regularly and managing your stress levels light therapy \u2013 where a special lamp called a light box is used to simulate exposure to sunlight talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or counselling  antidepressant medication, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Read more about how seasonal affective disorder is treated.

Sometimes, the chemicals in saliva can crystalise to form a tiny stone. Salivary gland stones ('salivary calculi') can become lodged in the duct (tube) leading from the salivary gland, blocking the flow of saliva into the mouth. This can cause swelling and pain in the gland. The stones are largely made of calcium, and most are smaller than 1cm in diameter, although they can range from being less than 1mm to as large as a few centimetres. Usually, a procedure is needed to have the stone removed, although it can sometimes come out of the mouth on its own, or after a bit of probing. You could try dislodging the stone yourself by sucking on lemon to stimulate saliva flow. Why do salivary stones form? It's not known why salivary gland stones form. There's usually no imbalance of calcium anywhere else in the body. The formation of a stone may be linked to changes in the flow of saliva through the gland. You're probably more at risk of one if saliva is reduced or thickened \u2013 for example, if you're dehydrated, or not eating much (eating stimulates greater flow of saliva). Certain medicines may also increase your risk of salivary stones. Where do they form? Most salivary gland stones form in one of the submandibular glands \u2013 you have two of these glands (one on each side) under the bottom of your mouth. The stone becomes lodged in the duct running from the submandibular gland underneath the tongue. Saliva is also produced in the parotid glands just below and in front of your ears, and in the sublingual glands beneath your tongue, but it's much less common for stones to form here. How do I know I have a salivary gland stone? If the stone is very small and not blocking the duct, you may not realise you have it as there may not be any symptoms. A larger stone may be visible when you open your mouth wide. If the stone is big enough to cause symptoms, these symptoms will usually continue until the stone falls out or is removed. Dull pain and swelling If the stone partially blocks the duct and stops some of the flow of saliva, you might have: dull pain over the affected gland that comes and goes swelling of the gland, which may flare up and down over time  infection of the gland \u2013 it will be very painful and an abscess may form, which can make you feel unwell Intense pain and swelling after eating If the salivary gland is completely blocked, you may feel sudden, intense pain after you start eating at mealtimes. This is usually followed by swelling, which eases during the hours after a meal. Swelling and pain happens because the saliva cannot exit the blocked duct, so it backs up and builds up in the gland. How is it diagnosed? A GP may be able to see the stone when they examine your mouth. Otherwise, an X-ray would usually show it up. If the stone doesn't show up on X-ray, you may need one of the following more detailed scans: A computerised tomography (CT) scan, which uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the head and neck area. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images. Sialography \u2013 where a dye is injected into the gland before an X-ray is taken. Sialendoscopy \u2013 where a thin tube with a tiny light and camera on its end (an endoscope) is inserted into the duct, so the doctor can see into the gland. If a stone is visible, this can be removed at the same time (see below). How is it removed? Your GP may attempt to free up the stone by probing your salivary duct with a thin, blunt instrument. If this doesn't work, you may need a procedure called a therapeutic sialendoscopy (mentioned above). A local anaesthetic is given to numb the mouth, and a very thin endoscope is pushed into the duct. If a stone is seen, a tiny instrument at the end of the tube is used to grab the stone and pull it out. If the stone is large, it may need to be broken up first, using shock wave treatment (where ultrasound waves are directed at the stone to break it up). This is called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. In the past, doctors would remove salivary stones by making a small incision in the mouth, but such an operation is rarely necessary nowadays. What happens after it has been removed? Salivary stones are usually a one-off event and most people who develop one won't develop another again. If you're unlucky enough to develop another one, or develop a few at the same time, you may need an operation to remove the whole salivary gland. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in detail. You'll still be able to produce enough saliva from the other glands.

Here's what you should know if you think you've been infected. What are the symptoms and how long do they last? Symptoms include diarrhoea, stomach cramps and sometimes vomiting and fever. On average, it takes from 12 to 72 hours for the symptoms to develop after swallowing an infectious dose of salmonella. Symptoms usually last for four to seven days and most people recover without treatment. But if you become seriously ill, you may need hospital care because the dehydration caused by the illness can be life-threatening. Who gets salmonella? Anyone can get salmonella, but young children, the elderly and people who have immune systems that are not working properly (including people with cancer, AIDS or alcoholism) have a greater risk of becoming severely ill. How do you get infected with salmonella? You usually get salmonella by eating contaminated food. Salmonella bacteria live in the gut of many farm animals and can affect meat, eggs, poultry and milk. Other foods like green vegetables, fruit and shellfish can become contaminated through contact with manure in the soil or sewage in the water. Contamination is also possible if raw and cooked foods are stored together. Most tortoises and terrapins and other pet reptiles can also carry salmonella. Dogs, cats and rodents can occasionally become infected. It is impossible to tell from its appearance whether food is contaminated with salmonella. It will look, smell and taste normal. Salmonella can be spread from person to person by poor hygiene, by failing to wash your hands properly after going to the toilet, or after handling contaminated food. How can you avoid getting infected with salmonella? Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water: before preparing and eating food after handling raw food after going to the toilet or changing a baby's nappy after contact with pets and other animals, especially reptiles and amphibians after working in the garden Also: keep cooked food away from raw food store raw foods below cooked or ready-to-eat foods in the fridge to prevent contamination wash raw fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating cook food thoroughly, especially meat, so that it is piping hot keep all kitchen surfaces and equipment including knives, chopping boards and dish cloths clean do not drink untreated water from lakes, rivers or streams do not keep reptiles or amphibians in households where there is a child under 5 year of age, or someone with a weakened immune system If someone has salmonella, wash all dirty clothes, bedding and towels in the washing machine on the hottest cycle possible. Clean toilet seats, toilet bowls, flush handles, taps and wash hand basins after use with detergent and hot water, followed by a household disinfectant. How do you treat salmonella? It is important to drink plenty of fluids as diarrhoea or vomiting can lead to dehydration and you can lose important sugars and minerals from your body. Your doctor may recommend a rehydration solution, available from your pharmacist. Sometimes severe cases are treated with antibiotics. If you are given antibiotics, it is essential that you complete the course as prescribed. Do you need to stay off work or school? Yes. While you are ill and have symptoms, you are infectious. Children and adults should stay away from nursery, school or work for 48 hours after the symptoms have stopped. You should tell your employer you have had salmonella if you work with vulnerable groups such as the elderly, the young or those in poor health, or if you handle food.

The operation you have will depend on the reason for surgery and how much of your womb and reproductive system can safely be left in place. The main types of hysterectomy are described below. Total hysterectomy During a total hysterectomy, your womb and cervix (neck of the womb) is removed. A total hysterectomy is usually the preferred option over a subtotal hysterectomy, because removing the cervix means there's no risk of you developing cervical cancer at a later date. Subtotal hysterectomy A subtotal hysterectomy involves removing the main body of the womb and leaving the cervix in place. This procedure isn't performed very often. If the cervix is left in place, there's still a risk of cervical cancer developing and regular cervical screening will still be needed. Some women want to keep as much of their reproductive system as possible, including their cervix. If you feel this way, talk to your surgeon about any risks associated with keeping your cervix. Total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy A total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is a hysterectomy that also involves removing: the fallopian tubes (salpingectomy) the ovaries (oophorectomy) The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that the ovaries should only be removed if there's a significant risk of further problems \u2013 for example, if there's a family history of ovarian cancer. Your surgeon can discuss the pros and cons of removing your ovaries with you. Radical hysterectomy A radical hysterectomy is usually carried out to remove and treat cancer when other treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy aren't suitable or haven't worked. During the procedure, the body of your womb and cervix is removed, along with: your fallopian tubes part of your vagina ovaries lymph glands fatty tissue Performing a hysterectomy There are three ways a hysterectomy can be performed. These are: vaginal hysterectomy abdominal hysterectomy laparoscopic hysterectomy Vaginal hysterectomy During a vaginal hysterectomy, the womb and cervix are removed through an incision that's made in the top of the vagina. Special surgical instruments are inserted into the vagina to detach the womb from the ligaments that hold it in place. After the womb and cervix have been removed, the incision will be sewn up. The operation usually takes about an hour to complete. A vaginal hysterectomy can either be carried out using: general anaesthetic \u2013 where you'll be unconscious during the procedure local anaesthetic \u2013 where you'll be awake, but won't feel any pain spinal anaesthetic \u2013 where you'll be numb from the waist down A vaginal hysterectomy is usually preferred over an abdominal hysterectomy, because it's less invasive and involves a shorter stay in hospital. The recovery time also tends to be quicker. Abdominal hysterectomy During an abdominal hysterectomy, an incision will be made in your abdomen (tummy). It will either be made horizontally along your bikini line, or vertically from your belly button to your bikini line. A vertical incision will usually be used if there are large fibroids (non-cancerous growths) in your womb, or for some types of cancer. After your womb has been removed, the incision is stitched up. The operation takes about an hour to perform and a general anaesthetic is used. An abdominal hysterectomy may be recommended if your womb is enlarged by fibroids or pelvic tumours and it's not possible to remove it through your vagina. It may also be recommended if your ovaries need to be removed. Laparoscopic hysterectomy Laparoscopic surgery is also known as keyhole surgery. Nowadays, a laparoscopic hysterectomy is the preferred treatment method for removing the organs and surrounding tissues of the reproductive system. During the procedure, a small tube containing a telescope (laparoscope) and a tiny video camera will be inserted through a small incision in your abdomen. This allows the surgeon to see your internal organs. Instruments are then inserted through other small incisions in your abdomen or vagina to remove your womb, cervix and any other parts of your reproductive system. Laparoscopic hysterectomies are usually carried out under general anaesthetic. Vaginal hysterectomy illustration key 1. removing uterus through vagina 2. pelvic bone 3. bladder 4. fallopian tubes and ovaries Getting ready If you need to have a hysterectomy, it's important to be as fit and healthy as possible. Good health before your operation will reduce your risk of developing complications and speed up your recovery. As soon as you know you're going to have a hysterectomy, take the following steps: stop smoking eat a healthy, balanced diet exercise regularly lose weight (if you are overweight) You may need to have a pre-assessment appointment a few days before your operation. This may involve having some blood tests and a general health check to ensure you're fit for surgery. It's also a good opportunity to discuss any concerns and to ask questions.

It usually affects the lungs and skin. The symptoms of sarcoidosis depend on which organs are affected, but typically include: tender, red bumps on the skin shortness of breath a persistent cough (see below for a full list). For many people with sarcoidosis, symptoms often improve without treatment within a few months or years. For these people, the symptoms aren't usually severe. However, a few people find their symptoms develop gradually and get worse over time, to the point where they become severely affected. This is known as chronic sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is estimated to affect about one in every 10,000 people in the UK. There is currently no cure. Symptoms of sarcoidosis It's impossible to predict how sarcoidosis will affect a person, as the condition can affect any organ and the symptoms vary widely depending on which organs are involved.  Most people with sarcoidosis develop symptoms suddenly, but they usually clear within a few months or years and the condition doesn't come back. This is known as acute sarcoidosis. Some people don't have any symptoms at all, and the condition is diagnosed after an X-ray carried out for another reason. A few people find their symptoms develop gradually and get worse over time, to the point where they become severely affected. Lots of granulomas may form in an organ and prevent it from working properly. This is known as chronic sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis most often affects the lungs, skin and\/or lymph nodes (glands). Some of the typical symptoms are listed below, although someone with sarcoidosis will probably only have a few of these. Lung symptoms The lungs are affected in about 90% of people with sarcoidosis. This is known as pulmonary sarcoidosis. The two main symptoms are shortness of breath and a persistent dry cough. Some people with pulmonary sarcoidosis experience pain and discomfort in their chest, but this is uncommon. Skin symptoms The skin is affected in about 25% of people with sarcoidosis. This can cause tender, red bumps or patches to develop on the skin (particularly the shins), as well as rashes on the upper body. Other symptoms If other organs are affected, you may also have some of the following symptoms: tender and swollen glands in the face, neck, armpits or groin tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell painful joints red or sore eyes an abnormal heart rhythm a blocked or stuffy nose pain in the bones kidney stones headache Causes of sarcoidosis The body's immune system normally fights off infections by releasing white blood cells into the blood to isolate and destroy the germs. This results in inflammation (swelling and redness) of the body tissues in that area. The immune system responds like this to anything in the blood it doesn't recognise, and dies down when the infection has been cleared. It's thought that sarcoidosis happens because the immune system has gone into \"overdrive\", where the body starts to attack its own tissues and organs. The resulting inflammation then causes granulomas to develop in the organs. There are many similar conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, that are caused by the body attacking its own tissues. These are collectively known as autoimmune conditions. It's not known why the immune system behaves like this, but research is being carried out to see what triggers sarcoidosis (search clinical trials for sarcoidosis). It's possible that some environmental factor triggers the condition in people who are already genetically susceptible to it. Sarcoidosis can occasionally occur in more than one family member, but there's no evidence that the condition is inherited. The condition isn't infectious, so it can't be passed from person to person. Who's affected Sarcoidosis can affect people of any age, but usually starts in young adults aged between 20 and 40. It's rare in childhood. The condition affects people from all ethnic backgrounds, but it's most common in people of African descent. It's also more common in women than men. Diagnosing sarcoidosis A number of different tests may be carried out to diagnose sarcoidosis, depending on which organs are affected. If your symptoms suggest you have pulmonary sarcoidosis (sarcoidosis affecting the lungs), you may have a chest X-ray or a computerised tomography (CT) scan of your lungs to look for signs of the condition. In some cases, doctors may want to examine the inside of your lungs using a long, thin, flexible tube with a light source and a camera at one end (endoscope) that's passed down your throat. A small sample of lung tissue may also be removed during this test so it can be studied under a microscope. This is known as a biopsy. If doctors think you may have sarcoidosis affecting other organs \u2013 such as the skin, heart or eyes \u2013 scans or examinations of these areas will usually be carried out. How sarcoidosis is treated Most people with sarcoidosis don't need treatment as the condition often goes away on its own, usually within a few months or years. Simple lifestyle changes and over-the-counter painkillers (such as paracetamol or ibuprofen) are often all that's needed to control the pain of any flare-ups. See living with sarcoidosis (below) for lifestyle advice. Doctors will monitor your condition to check if it's getting any better or worse without treatment. This can be done with regular X-rays, breathing tests and blood tests. Medication If treatment is recommended, prednisolone steroid tablets are usually used. This medication is the most effective treatment for sarcoidosis, helping to relieve symptoms and prevent damage to affected organs by reducing inflammation and preventing scarring. However, steroid medication can cause unpleasant side effects such as weight gain and mood swings if taken in high doses. Other side effects, such as weakening of the bones (osteoporosis), can also develop if it's taken for a long time. Therefore, this medication is only used when necessary. You may initially be given a high dose of steroid medication for a short period of time, before switching to a low dose for the months or years that follow. Your condition will be monitored during this time to see how well the treatment is working. In some cases, taking calcium or vitamin D supplements can help reduce the risk of osteoporosis caused by long-term use of steroid medication. However, you should only take these if advised by your doctor. Some people with sarcoidosis may have an increased risk of developing complications, including kidney stones, while taking steroid medication. Alternative medications may sometimes be used if steroids aren't enough or there are concerns about side effects. In these cases, a type of medication called an immunosuppressant might be recommended. These medications may help to improve your symptoms by reducing the activity of your immune system. Living with sarcoidosis The Sarcoidosis Charity recommends the following lifestyle measures if you have sarcoidosis: stop smoking, if you smoke avoid exposure to dust, chemicals, fumes and toxic gases eat a healthy balanced diet drink plenty of water get plenty of exercise and sleep Find a sarcoidosis support group. Outlook Symptoms of sarcoidosis may come and go, and can usually be managed with over-the-counter painkillers so they don't affect everyday life. Most people with the condition find their symptoms have disappeared within a few years of their diagnosis. For some people with sarcoidosis, the condition slowly gets worse over time and they end up with organ damage. For example, their lungs may stop working properly, causing increasing breathlessness. Help is available for people with severe, persistent sarcoidosis \u2013 ask your doctor for advice and visit The Sarcoidosis Charity (which has a list of support groups) or the British Lung Foundation. Information about you If you have sarcoidosis, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).

Bone cancer is itself rare, with around 600 cases being diagnosed in the UK each year. The three main types of primary bone cancer are chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Ewing sarcoma most commonly affects people who are 10 to 20 years old. Sarcomas A sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in the body's supporting tissues. Bone sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas are the two main types. Ewing sarcoma usually occurs in bone. It most commonly develops in the: pelvis bone (hips) thigh bone (femur) shin bone (tibia) However, the condition can also develop in the soft tissues surrounding the bone or joint. This type of Ewing sarcoma is known as extraosseous, which means outside the bone. Symptoms of Ewing sarcoma The symptoms of Ewing sarcoma will depend on the size of the cancer and where it is in the body. The main symptoms are pain in the affected area that gets progressively worse, and swelling and tenderness. Other possible, but less common, symptoms may include a high temperature (fever), severe tiredness and weight loss. In some cases of Ewing sarcoma, there may not be any symptoms at all. However, as the tumour grows it could weaken the affected bone, increasing the risk of fracture. What causes Ewing sarcoma? Like other types of bone cancer, the exact cause of Ewing sarcoma is unknown. As the condition tends to predominantly affect older children and teenagers, one theory is that it may be related to fast-growing bones. The rapid growth spurt that happens during puberty may in some way make bone tissue more vulnerable to cancer. Research has also found babies born with an umbilical hernia are three times more likely to develop Ewing sarcoma.  However, the increased risk is still small as only 1 in 110,000 children with an umbilical hernia will go on to develop the condition. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risks and causes of bone cancer. Diagnosing Ewing sarcoma When you visit your GP because of bone pain, they'll ask you about your symptoms and examine the affected area. Your GP may refer you for an X-ray to check for anything abnormal. If abnormalities are found, you'll be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (a bone specialist). They may recommend that you have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to examine the area in closer detail. A bone biopsy may be carried out to confirm whether cancer is present. A fine needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the affected area so it can be examined under a microscope. It can either be carried out using a general anaesthetic or a local anaesthetic. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about tests for bone cancer and the stages of bone cancer. Treating Ewing sarcoma Like all types of cancer, the earlier Ewing sarcoma is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat. Ewing sarcoma is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove. Ewing sarcoma also responds well to radiotherapy. It can be used to shrink the tumour after chemotherapy, and before or after surgery to lower the risk of the cancer returning. In some cases, surgically removing Ewing's sarcoma can be difficult \u2013 for example, if it develops in the pelvis. In this case, radiotherapy may be used as the main treatment. Surgery If surgery is recommended, the type you'll have will depend on: the size of the tumour where it is in your body whether it has grown into the tissues surrounding the bone You may have surgery to remove part or all of the bone affected by cancer. This type of surgery is known as resection. Limb-sparing surgery involves removing the area of bone on an arm or leg where the cancer is growing. A piece of metal (prosthesis) or a bone graft will be used to replace the piece of bone that is removed. In some cases, your whole arm or leg may need to be removed (amputation). This may be the only option to prevent the cancer returning if it's spread into the tissues surrounding the bone. For more information about the types of treatment for bone cancer, visit the Cancer Research UK website. Living with bone cancer If you're diagnosed with bone cancer, it can be upsetting and frightening. Knowing as much about the type of cancer you have and the best treatment options will help you make decisions. The majority of people who have surgery for bone cancer have a limb-sparing procedure. However, for some people, having their limb amputated may be the best option. This can be a very difficult situation to cope with and you may experience emotions such as grief and bereavement. It's important to seek help and talk about how you're feeling. You could talk to your partner, family, friends or the healthcare professionals in charge of your care. Talking to others will help you come to terms with your condition and treatment. There are also a number of practical issues you'll need to deal with, such as financial matters and coping with day-to-day activities such as school, college or work. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about your emotions and cancer and coping with bone cancer. Information about you If you or your child has Ewing sarcoma, your clinical team will pass information about you\/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).

Cancer occurs when some of the cells grow and multiply in an abnormal way. When cancer affects organs and solid tissues, it causes a growth called a tumour to form. Cancer can occur in any part of the body where the cells multiply abnormally.

It can affect the skin and internal organs. It's mainly seen in people with a poorly controlled or severe HIV infection. It can also affect some people who have a weakened immune system for another reason, as well as people who have a genetic vulnerability to the virus. See What causes Kaposi's sarcoma? for more information. Signs and symptoms The most common initial symptom is the appearance of small, painless, flat and discoloured patches on the skin or inside the mouth. They're usually red or purple and look similar to bruises. Over time, the patches may grow into lumps known as nodules and may merge into each other. Internal organs can also be affected, including the lymph nodes, lungs and the digestive system, which can cause symptoms such as: uncomfortable swelling in the arms or legs (lymphoedema) breathlessness, coughing up blood and chest pain nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhoea The rate at which symptoms progress depends on the type of Kaposi's sarcoma you have. Most types get worse quickly in a matter of weeks or months without treatment, but some progress very slowly over many years. When to seek medical advice You should see your GP if you have any worrying symptoms you think could be caused by Kaposi's sarcoma. If you have HIV, you can also contact your local HIV clinic if you have any concerns. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine your skin to look for the characteristic discoloured patches. If they suspect Kaposi's sarcoma, they will refer you for further tests to confirm the diagnosis. These tests may include: an HIV test \u2013 a blood test to confirm whether or not you have HIV (if you haven't already been diagnosed with the condition) a skin biopsy \u2013 where a small sample of cells is removed from an affected area of skin and checked for Kaposi's sarcoma cells an endoscopy \u2013 where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat to see if your lungs or digestive system are affected a computerised tomography (CT) scan to see if your lymph nodes or other parts of your body are affected What causes Kaposi's sarcoma? Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a virus called the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). This virus is thought to be spread during sex, through saliva, or from a mother to her baby during birth. HHV-8 is a relatively common virus and the vast majority of people who have it will not develop Kaposi's sarcoma. It only seems to cause cancer in some people with a weakened immune system and in some people who have a genetic vulnerability to the virus. A weakened immune system allows the HHV-8 virus to multiply to high levels in the blood, which increases the chance it will cause Kaposi's sarcoma. The virus appears to alter the genetic instructions that control cell growth. This means some cells reproduce uncontrollably and form lumps of tissue known as tumours. Types of Kaposi's sarcoma and their treatment There are four main types of Kaposi's sarcoma. These types affect different groups of people and are treated in different ways. HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma Although it's not as common as it used to be, Kaposi's sarcoma is still one of the main types of cancer to affect people with HIV.  HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma can progress very quickly if not treated. However, it can usually be controlled by taking HIV medication \u2013 known as combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) \u2013 to prevent HIV multiplying and allow the immune system to recover. The immune system can then reduce the levels of HHV-8 in the body. Read more about treating HIV. Some people may also require treatment with radiotherapy (where high-energy rays are used to destroy cancer cells) or chemotherapy (where powerful medications are used to destroy cancer cells), depending on the site and extent of the cancer and what symptoms it's causing. Classic Kaposi's sarcoma Classic Kaposi's sarcoma mainly affects middle-aged and elderly men of Mediterranean or Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Ashkenazi Jews are descended from Jewish communities that lived in central and eastern Europe. Most Jewish people in the UK are Ashkenazi Jews. It's thought people who develop classic Kaposi's sarcoma were born with a genetic vulnerability to the HHV-8 virus. Unlike the other types of Kaposi's sarcoma, the symptoms of classic Kaposi's sarcoma progress very slowly over many years and are usually limited to the skin. Immediate treatment isn't usually required because, in many cases, the condition doesn't affect life expectancy. You'll usually be monitored carefully and only treated if the symptoms get significantly worse. Radiotherapy is often used if treatment is required, although small skin patches or nodules may be removed using minor surgery or cryotherapy (freezing). Transplant-related Kaposi's sarcoma Transplant-related Kaposi's sarcoma is a rare complication of an organ transplant. It occurs because the immunosuppressant medication used to weaken the immune system and help prevent the body rejecting the new organ can allow a previous HHV-8 infection to reactivate, which means levels of the virus increase as it starts multiplying again. Transplant-related Kaposi's sarcoma can be aggressive and usually needs to be treated quickly. It's normally treated by reducing or stopping the immunosuppressants, if this is possible. If this is unsuccessful, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used. Endemic African Kaposi's sarcoma Endemic African Kaposi's sarcoma is common in parts of Africa and is one of the most widespread types of cancer in that region. Although this type of Kaposi's sarcoma is classified separately from HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma, many cases may actually result from an undiagnosed HIV infection. All suspected cases therefore must have an HIV test, as the most effective treatment in these cases is HIV medication. In cases not caused by HIV infection, this type of Kaposi's sarcoma may be the result of a genetic vulnerability to HHV-8. These cases are usually treated with chemotherapy, although sometimes radiotherapy may be used. Outlook With proper treatment, Kaposi's sarcoma can usually be controlled for many years. Deaths from the condition are uncommon in the UK. The discoloured patches of skin will often shrink and fade with treatment, although they may not ever disappear completely. A complete cure for any type of Kaposi's sarcoma isn't always possible, and there's a chance the condition could recur in the future. If you think this is happening, contact your HIV clinic, hospital specialist or GP as soon as possible.

Tissues that can be affected by soft tissue sarcomas include fat, muscle, blood vessels, deep skin tissues, tendons and ligaments. Soft tissue sarcomas can develop in almost any part of the body, including the legs, arms and the trunk (torso). There are many different types of soft tissue sarcoma, depending on where in the body they are located. For example: leiomyosarcomas \u2013 which develop in muscle tissue liposarcomas \u2013 which develop in fat tissue angiosarcomas \u2013 which develop in the cells of the blood or lymph vessels gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) \u2013 which can develop in the connective tissues that support the organs of the digestive system Soft tissue sarcomas account for around one in every 100 cancers diagnosed in the UK. More than 3,000 new cases are diagnosed every year. What causes soft tissue sarcomas? Cancer develops when cells multiply uncontrollably, forming tumours.  In the vast majority of soft tissue sarcomas it's unclear what causes this to happen but there are a number of factors known to increase the risk, including: age \u2013 soft tissue sarcomas can occur at any age, including in children, but they are more common in middle-aged or elderly people and your risk increases as you get older certain genetic conditions \u2013 some genetic conditions, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and retinoblastoma, are associated with an increased risk of soft tissue sarcomas previous radiotherapy \u2013 some people who have previously had radiotherapy for another type of cancer develop a soft tissue sarcoma, often many years after their previous treatment exposure to certain chemicals \u2013 exposure to some chemicals, including vinyl chloride, dioxins and phenoxyacetic herbicides, has been associated with increased rates of soft tissue sarcomas One particular type of soft tissue sarcoma called Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma \u2013 which develops in skin cells \u2013 is caused by a virus known as the human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) infecting someone with a weakened immune system (such as people with HIV). Signs and symptoms As soft tissue sarcomas can develop in most parts of the body, they can cause a wide range of symptoms. For example, a tumour near the stomach may cause abdominal (tummy) pain, a feeling of fullness and constipation, whereas a tumour near the lungs may cause a cough or breathlessness. There are often no obvious symptoms in the early stages of soft tissue sarcomas, although you may notice a soft, painless lump under your skin or deeper, that can't easily be moved around and gets bigger over time. You should see your GP if you have a worrying lump or any other troublesome symptoms. A lump the size of a golf ball or larger should be regarded as suspicious and needs to be investigated urgently. Although it is much more likely you have a benign (non-cancerous) condition, it is important to get your symptoms checked out. Diagnosing soft tissue sarcomas If your GP feels there is a possibility you do have cancer, they will refer you for a number of hospital tests to confirm whether you have a soft tissue sarcoma. In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of soft tissue sarcoma and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected soft tissue sarcoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral. A diagnosis of a soft tissue sarcoma will usually be made by a hospital specialist and will be based on your symptoms, a physical examination, and the results of: a biopsy \u2013 where a sample of suspected cancerous tissue is removed using a needle or during an operation so it can be tested and analysed in a laboratory imaging tests \u2013 a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is the main type of scan carried out to assess soft tissue sarcomas, although other scans may also be carried out If a diagnosis of a soft tissue sarcoma is confirmed, these tests will also help determine how far the cancer has spread (known as the 'stage') and how aggressive the cancer is (known as the 'grade'). Treating soft tissue sarcomas If you're diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma your care team of specialist doctors and nurses will help you decide on the most appropriate treatment. Treatment depends on factors such as the stage and grade of the cancer, the location of any tumours, and your age and general health. The main treatments used are: surgery \u2013 to remove any tumours radiotherapy \u2013 where high-energy radiation is used to kill cancer cells chemotherapy \u2013 where medication is used to kill cancer cells These treatments are described in more detail below. Surgery Surgery is the main treatment for soft tissue sarcomas that are detected at an early stage. It involves removing the cancerous tumour along with a section of surrounding healthy tissue. This will help ensure no cancer cells are left behind. Every effort will be made to reduce the impact of surgery on the appearance and functionality of the affected body part. But there is a possibility you'll have some difficulty using the part of the body that is operated on after surgery and sometimes reconstructive plastic surgery may be needed to repair significant damage. In a small number of cases, there may be no option but to amputate the part of the body where the cancer is located, such as part of the leg. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy is often used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells. This is carried out using an external machine that directs beams of radiation at a defined treatment area. Radiotherapy may also sometimes be used before surgery to make a tumour easier to remove, or as part of your treatment to reduce your symptoms if surgery is not possible. Common side effects of radiotherapy include sore skin, tiredness and hair loss in the treatment area. These tend to get better within a few days or weeks of treatment finishing. Read more about the side effects of radiotherapy. Chemotherapy Like radiotherapy, chemotherapy is sometimes used before surgery to shrink a tumour and make it easier to remove. This involves being given anti-cancer medication directly into a vein (intravenously). Chemotherapy may also be used alone or alongside radiotherapy for soft tissue sarcomas that cannot be surgically removed. Chemotherapy medications have a poisonous effect on the body's cells, and can cause a number of temporary but unpleasant side effects, such as feeling tired and weak all the time, feeling and being sick, and hair loss from several parts of the body. Read more about the side effects of chemotherapy. Outlook As with most types of cancer, the outlook for a soft tissues sarcoma depends largely on how far the cancer has advanced when it is diagnosed. If the cancer is detected at an early stage and can be removed during surgery, there is a possibility it can be cured. But you'll need regular check-ups following treatment to check for any signs the cancer has come back. You may also need long-term physiotherapy and occupational therapy to help you manage any physical difficulties resulting from surgery. A cure is not usually possible if a soft tissue sarcoma is only detected at a late stage when it has already spread to other parts of the body, although treatment can help slow the spread of the cancer and control your symptoms. Overall, around half of those diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma will live at least five years from the point of their diagnosis. Want to know more?

Coronaviruses are common viruses linked to infections in humans and animals. There are several recognised human coronaviruses that cause mild respiratory infections, such as the common cold. However, this type of virus can also include strains that cause more severe illnesses, such as SARS. There have been two self-limiting SARS outbreaks to date, during 2002 to 2004 (see below) associated with a highly contagious and potentially life-threatening form of pneumonia. Since 2004, there haven't been any known cases of SARS reported anywhere in the world. Symptoms of SARS SARS has flu-like symptoms that usually begin two to seven days after infection. In some cases, the incubation period (the time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms) can be up to 10 days. The symptoms of SARS include: a high temperature (fever) over 38C (100.4F) fatigue (extreme tiredness) headaches  chills muscle pain loss of appetite diarrhoea After these symptoms the infection will begin to affect your respiratory system (lungs and airways), leading to additional symptoms such as: a dry cough breathing difficulties an increasing lack of oxygen in the blood, which can be fatal in the most severe cases The SARS pandemic SARS originated in China in 2002. The infection quickly spread to other countries (a pandemic), and resulted in more than 8,000 cases and 774 deaths before the virus was eventually brought under control. It's thought a strain of the coronavirus usually only found in small mammals mutated (a DNA change occurred), enabling it to infect humans. The SARS infection quickly spread from China to other Asian countries. There were also a small number of cases in several other countries, including four in the UK, plus a significant outbreak in Toronto, Canada. The SARS pandemic was eventually brought under control in July 2003, following a policy of isolating people suspected of having the condition, and screening all passengers travelling by air from affected countries for signs of the infection. During the period of infection, there were 8,098 reported cases of SARS and 774 deaths. This means that the virus killed about one in 10 people who were infected. People over 65 years of age were particularly at risk, with over half dying from the infection in this age group. In 2004, there was another small SARS outbreak linked to a medical laboratory in China. It was thought to have been the result of someone coming into direct contact with a sample of the virus, rather than being caused by animal-to-human or human-to-human transmission. How SARS is spread SARS is an airborne virus, which means it's spread in a similar way to colds and flu. The SARS virus is spread in small droplets of saliva coughed or sneezed into the air by an infected person. If someone else breathes in the droplets they can become infected. SARS can also be spread indirectly if an infected person touches surfaces, such as door handles, with unwashed hands. Someone who touches the surface may also become infected. The SARS virus may also be spread through an infected person\u2019s faeces (stools). For example, if they don't wash their hands properly after going to the toilet, they may pass the infection on to others. Evidence from the SARS pandemic in 2002\/03 showed that people living with or caring for someone with a known SARS infection were most at risk of developing the infection themselves. Treatment for SARS There's currently no cure for SARS but research to find a vaccine is ongoing. A person suspected of having SARS should be admitted to hospital immediately and kept in isolation under close observation. Treatment is mainly supportive and may include: assisting with breathing using a ventilator to deliver oxygen antibiotics to treat bacteria that cause pneumonia antiviral medications high doses of steroids to reduce swelling in the lungs There's little in the way of scientific evidence to show that these treatments are effective. The antiviral medication, ribavirin, is known to be ineffective at treating SARS. Prevention advice Avoid travelling to areas of the world where there's an uncontrolled SARS outbreak. To reduce your risk of becoming infected, avoid direct contact with people with SARS (until at least 10 days after their symptoms have gone). To avoid spreading the infection, it's important to follow the prevention advice outlined below: wash your hands thoroughly using an alcohol-based hand detergent cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough avoid sharing food, drink and utensils regularly clean surfaces with disinfectant In some situations, it may be appropriate to wear gloves, masks and goggles to help prevent the spread of SARS. Future SARS outbreaks Although the threat of SARS to public health seems to have passed, international health officials continue to remain vigilant. The World Health Organization (WHO) monitors countries throughout the world for any unusual disease activity. Therefore, if another SARS outbreak were to occur, it should be possible to limit the spread of infection using the same measures that were implemented during the 2002\/03 pandemic (see above). The SARS virus  Viral mutations Like all living things, viruses are constantly changing and evolving. A mutation is where genetic information stored inside an organism changes. Mutations occur randomly and most aren't particularly significant. However, sometimes by chance, a mutated virus is able to infect humans. Many pandemics (global outbreaks of infectious illnesses) that have occurred in recent history are thought to have been caused by viruses previously only found in animals. After mutating, the viruses became capable of infecting humans. Examples of mutated viruses include: SARS HIV \u2013 thought to be a mutated version of a virus found in monkeys avian flu \u2013 a mutated version of a flu virus found in birds swine flu \u2013 a mutated version of a flu virus thought to have originated in pigs Page last reviewed: 03\/10\/2014 Next review due: 03\/10\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The main symptom of scabies is intense itching that's worse at night. It also causes a skin rash on areas where the mites have burrowed. Read more about the symptoms of scabies. Scabies mites Scabies mites are called Sarcoptes scabiei. They feed using their mouths and front legs to burrow into the outer layer of skin (epidermis), where they lay eggs. After three to four days, the baby mites (larvae) hatch and move to the surface of the skin, where they mature into adults. Scabies like warm places, such as skin folds, between the fingers, under fingernails, or around the buttock or breast creases. They can also hide under watch straps, bracelets or rings. Read more about the life cycle of the scabies mite. How scabies is spread Scabies is usually spread through prolonged periods of skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, or through sexual contact. It's also possible \u2013 but rare \u2013 for scabies to be passed on by sharing clothing, towels and bedding with someone who's infected. It can take up to eight weeks for the symptoms of scabies to appear after the initial infection. This is known as the incubation period. Read more about the causes of scabies. Scabies outbreaks Scabies is widespread in densely populated areas with limited access to medical care, and is most common in the following tropical and subtropical areas: Africa Central and South America northern and central Australia Caribbean Islands India southeast Asia In developed countries, scabies outbreaks can sometimes occur in places where there are lots of people, such as schools, nurseries and care homes. In the UK, most outbreaks of scabies occur in the winter. This may be because people tend to spend more time indoors and closer to each other at this time of year. It's difficult to know exactly how many cases of scabies there are in the UK. This is because many people don't visit their GP and treat the condition with non-prescription medicines. Treating scabies Visit your GP if you think you have scabies. It's not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated. The two most widely used treatments for scabies are permethrin cream and malathion lotion (brand name Derbac M). Both medications contain insecticides that kill the scabies mite. Permethrin 5% cream is usually recommended as the first treatment. Malathion 0.5% lotion is used if permethrin is ineffective. If your partner has been diagnosed with genital scabies, to avoid reinfection you should visit your nearest sexual health clinic so you can be checked and, if necessary, treated. Avoid having sex and other forms of close bodily contact until both you and your partner have completed the full course of treatment. Read more about diagnosing scabies and treating scabies. Complications of scabies Scabies can sometimes lead to a secondary skin infection if your skin becomes irritated and inflamed through excessive itching. Crusted scabies is a rare but more severe form of scabies, where a large number of mites are in the skin. This can develop in older people and those with a lowered immunity.

It causes a distinctive pink-red rash. The illness is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, also known as group A streptococcus, which are found on the skin and in the throat. Generally, scarlet fever is much less common than it used to be but in recent years there have been a number of significant outbreaks. For example, figures published by Public Health England show that from September 2013 to March 2014 there were 2,830 cases of scarlet fever. For the same period in 2014\/15 a total of 5,746 cases were recorded. The reason for recent increase is unclear. It\u2019s important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of scarlet fever so that early treatment with antibiotics can be given. Scarlet fever symptoms Scarlet fever usually follows a sore throat or a skin infection, such as impetigo, caused by particular strains of streptococcus bacteria. Initial symptoms usually include a sore throat, headache and a high temperature (38.3C\/101F or above), flushed cheeks and a swollen tongue. A day or two later the characteristic pinkish rash appears. It usually occurs on the chest and stomach before spreading to other areas of the body, such as the ears and neck. The symptoms of scarlet fever usually develop two to five days after infection, although the incubation period (the period between exposure to the infection and symptoms appearing) can be as short as one day or as long as seven days. The rash feels like sandpaper to touch and it may be itchy. On darker skin the rash may be more difficult to see although its rough texture should be apparent. When to seek medical advice Scarlet fever usually clears up after about a week, but if you think you or your child may have it, see your GP for a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Your GP should be able to diagnose scarlet fever by examining the distinctive rash and asking about other symptoms. They may also decide to take a sample of saliva from the back of the throat so it can be tested in a laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. There's no evidence to suggest that catching scarlet fever when pregnant will put your baby at risk. However, if you're heavily pregnant, tell the doctors and midwives in charge of your care if you've been in contact with someone who has scarlet fever. How scarlet fever spreads Scarlet fever is very contagious and can be caught by: breathing in bacteria in airborne droplets from an infected person's coughs and sneezes touching the skin of a person with a streptococcal skin infection, such as impetigo sharing contaminated towels, baths, clothes or bed linen It can also be caught from carriers \u2013 people who have the bacteria in their throat or on their skin but don't have any symptoms. Who's affected by scarlet fever Most cases (about 80%) of scarlet fever occur in children under 10 (usually between two and eight years of age). However, people of any age can get the illness. As it's so contagious, scarlet fever is likely to affect someone in close contact with a person with a sore throat or skin infection caused by streptococcus bacteria. Outbreaks often occur in nurseries and schools where children are in close contact with one another. The symptoms of scarlet fever will only develop in people susceptible to toxins produced by the streptococcus bacteria. Most children over 10 years of age will have developed immunity to these toxins. It's possible to catch scarlet fever more than once, but this is rare. Treating scarlet fever Scarlet fever used to be a very serious illness, but nowadays most cases tend to be mild. It can easily be treated with antibiotics. Liquid antibiotics, such as penicillin or amoxicillin, are often used to treat children. These must be taken for 10 days, even though most people recover after four to five days. It's important to be aware that your child will still be infectious for 24 hours after antibiotic treatment has begun, and therefore they shouldn't attend nursery or school during this period (see below). Without antibiotic treatment, your child will be infectious for 1-2 weeks after symptoms appear. Read more about treating scarlet fever. Complications of scarlet fever With the right treatment, further problems are unlikely. However, there's a small risk of the infection spreading to other parts of the body and causing more serious infections, such as an ear infection, sinusitis, or pneumonia. Read more about complications of scarlet fever. Preventing scarlet fever from spreading There\u2019s currently no vaccine for scarlet fever. If your child has scarlet fever, keep them away from nursery or school for at least 24 hours after starting treatment with antibiotics. Adults with the illness should also stay off work for at least 24 hours after starting treatment. GPs, schools and nurseries should be aware of the current high levels of scarlet fever and inform local health protection teams if they become aware of cases, particularly if more than one child is affected. Children and adults should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze and wash their hands with soap and water after using or disposing of tissues. Avoid sharing contaminated utensils, cups and glasses, clothes, baths, bed linen or towels. Scarlatina Scarlet fever is also sometimes known as scarlatina, although this often refers to a milder form of the illness.

Scars are very common \u2013 most people have at least one on their body. They are a natural part of the healing process. Scars can occur inside and outside the body. For example, they can occur on the internal organs where a cut has been made during surgery, and can develop after certain skin conditions, such as acne and chicken pox. How do scars form? When the skin is wounded and there is a break in the body\u2019s tissues, the body produces more of a protein called collagen, as part of the healing process. Collagen builds up where the tissue has been damaged, helping to heal and strengthen the wound. For a period of about three months or longer, new collagen continues to form and blood supply increases, causing the scar to become raised, lumpy and red. Some collagen then breaks down at the site of the wound, the blood supply reduces and the scar gradually becomes smoother, softer and paler. Although scars are permanent, they can fade over a period of up to two years. It is unlikely they will fade any more after this time. Skin wounds can be caused by many things, including: accidental injuries surgery burns and scalds intentional harm Read more about the causes of scars. Where do scars form? Scarring is unpredictable and varies from person to person. Certain areas of the body are more at risk of scarring, such as the chest, back, ear lobe and the shoulder. Scars that form on the knees and shoulders can appear stretched or widened as a result of the healing process occurring over movable joints. Types of scars The different types of scars include: Flat, pale scars \u2013 these are the most common type of scar and are due to the body's natural healing process. Initially, they may be red or dark and raised after the wound has healed, but will become paler and flatter naturally over time. This can take up to two years. Hypertrophic scars \u2013 red, raised scars that form along a wound and can remain this way for a number of years. Keloid scars \u2013 these are caused by an excess of scar tissue produced at the site of the wound, where the scar grows beyond the boundaries of the original wound, even after it has healed. Pitted (atrophic or \"ice-pick\") scars \u2013 these have a sunken appearance. Contracture scars \u2013 these are caused by the skin shrinking and tightening, usually after a burn, which can restrict movement. Read more about the types of scars. Treating scars Depending on the type and age of a scar, a variety of different treatments may help make them less visible and improve their appearance. Scars are unlikely to disappear completely, although most will gradually fade over time. If scarring is unsightly, uncomfortable or restrictive, treatment options may include: silicone gel sheets pressure dressings corticosteroid injections cosmetic camouflage (make-up) surgery It is often the case that a combination of treatments can be used. Read more about treating scars. Emotional effects of scarring Scarring, particularly when it is on the face, can be very distressing, especially if you feel you are being stared at. If you avoid meeting people as a result of your appearance, you may become socially isolated. This can lead to feelings of depression. If you feel that your scars are making you depressed or affecting your daily activities, make sure you visit your GP. Preventing or improving scars It isn't possible to prevent scars from forming, but there are things you can do to help your scar be less visible and heal better, such as immediately cleaning dirt, objects and dead tissue from wounds. Other ways to improve scarring include: not scratching or picking at scabs and spots covering wounds with a waterproof ointment (such as Vaseline) using silicone gels or sheets to reduce redness and encourage healing Scars: skin camouflage Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

The parasite is most commonly found throughout Africa, but also lives in parts of South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Asia. The Travel Health Pro website has a map of where schistosomiasis is found. You often don't have any symptoms when you first become infected with schistosomiasis, but the parasite can remain in the body for many years and cause damage to organs such as the bladder, kidneys and liver. The infection can be easily treated with a short course of medicine, so see your GP if you think you might have it. This page covers: How you get schistosomiasis Symptoms of schistosomiasis Long-term problems caused by schistosomiasis When to seek medical advice Treatments for schistosomiasis Preventing schistosomiasis How you get schistosomiasis The worms that cause schistosomiasis live in fresh water, such as: ponds lakes rivers reservoirs canals Showers that take unfiltered water directly from lakes or rivers may also spread the infection, but the worms aren't found in the sea, chlorinated swimming pools or properly treated water supplies. You can become infected if you come into contact with contaminated water \u2013 for example, when paddling, swimming or washing \u2013 and the tiny worms burrow into your skin. Once in your body, the worms move through your blood to areas such as the liver and bowel. After a few weeks, the worms start to lay eggs. Some eggs remain inside the body and are attacked by the immune system, while some are passed out in the person's urine or poo. Without treatment, the worms can keep laying eggs for several years. If the eggs pass out of the body into water, they release tiny larvae that need to grow inside freshwater snails for a few weeks before they're able to infect another person. This means it's not possible to catch the infection from someone else who has it. Symptoms of schistosomiasis Many people with schistosomiasis don't have any symptoms, or don't experience any for several months or even years. You probably won't notice that you've been infected, although occasionally people get small, itchy red bumps on their skin for a few days where the worms burrowed in. After a few weeks, some people develop: a high temperature (fever) above 38C (100.4F) an itchy, red, blotchy and raised rash a cough diarrhoea muscle and joint pain abdominal (tummy) pain a general sense of feeling unwell These symptoms, known as acute schistosomiasis, often get better by themselves within a few weeks. But it's still important to get treated because the parasite can remain in your body and lead to long-term problems (see below). Long-term problems caused by schistosomiasis Some people with schistosomiasis, regardless of whether they had any initial symptoms or not, eventually develop more serious problems in parts of the body the eggs have travelled to. This is known as chronic schistosomiasis. Chronic schistosomiasis can include a range of symptoms and problems, depending on the exact area that's infected. For example, an infection in the: digestive system can cause anaemia, abdominal pain and swelling, diarrhoea and blood in your poo urinary system can cause irritation of the bladder (cystitis), pain when peeing, a frequent need to pee, and blood in your urine heart and lungs can cause a persistent cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and coughing up blood nervous system or brain can cause seizures (fits), headaches, weakness and numbness in your legs, and dizziness Without treatment, affected organs can become permanently damaged. When to seek medical advice Visit your GP if you develop the symptoms above and you've travelled in parts of the world where schistosomiasis is found, or if you're concerned that you may have been exposed to the parasites while travelling. Tell your GP about your travel history and whether you think you may have been exposed to potentially contaminated water. If your GP suspects schistosomiasis, they may refer you to an expert in tropical diseases. The diagnosis is usually made by testing a sample of your blood. In some cases, eggs may be seen in a sample or your urine or poo. Treatments for schistosomiasis Schistosomiasis can usually be treated successfully with a short course of a medication called praziquantel, that kills the worms. Praziquantel is most effective once the worms have grown a bit, so treatment may be delayed until eight weeks after you were infected, or repeated again after this time. Steroid medication can also be used to help relieve the symptoms of acute schistosomiasis, or symptoms caused by damage to the brain or nervous system. Preventing schistosomiasis There's no vaccine for schistosomiasis, so it's important to be aware of the risks and take precautions to avoid exposure to contaminated water. You can check whether the area you're visiting is known to have a problem with schistosomiasis using Travel Health Pro's country information section. If you're visiting one of these areas: avoid paddling, swimming and washing in fresh water \u2013 only swim in the sea or chlorinated swimming pools take waterproof trousers and boots with you if there's a chance you'll need to cross a stream or river boil or filter water before drinking \u2013 as the parasites could burrow into your lips or mouth if you drink contaminated water avoid medicines sold locally that are advertised to treat or prevent schistosomiasis \u2013 these are often either fake, substandard, ineffective or not given at the correct dosage don't rely on assurances from hotels, tourist boards or similar that a particular stretch of water is safe \u2013 there have been reports of some organisations downplaying the risks Applying insect repellent to your skin or quickly drying yourself with a towel after getting out of the water aren't reliable ways of preventing infection, although it's a good idea to dry yourself as soon as possible if you're accidentally exposed to potentially contaminated water. There's some evidence that applying insect repellent containing 50% DEET to exposed areas each night after showering kills the parasite in the skin before it moves deeper into the body.

Read more about the symptoms of schizophrenia. Why does schizophrenia happen? The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown. However, most experts believe the condition is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is thought certain things make you more vulnerable to developing schizophrenia, and certain situations can trigger the condition. Read more about the causes of schizophrenia. Who is affected? Schizophrenia is one of the most common serious mental health conditions. About 1 in 100 people will experience schizophrenia in their lifetime, with many continuing to lead normal lives. Schizophrenia is most often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 35. Men and women are affected equally. There is no single test for schizophrenia. It is most often diagnosed after an assessment by a mental health care professional, such as a psychiatrist. It is important that schizophrenia is diagnosed as early as possible, as the chances of recovery improve the earlier it is treated. Read more about diagnosing schizophrenia. How is schizophrenia treated? Schizophrenia is usually treated with a combination of medication and therapy appropriate to each individual. In most cases, this will be antipsychotic medicines and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). People with schizophrenia will usually receive help from a community mental health team (CMHT), which will offer day-to-day support and treatment. Many people recover from schizophrenia, although they may have periods when symptoms return (relapses). Support and treatment can help reduce the impact the condition has on your life. Read more about treating schizophrenia. Living with schizophrenia If schizophrenia is well managed, it is possible to reduce the chances of severe relapses. This can include: recognising the signs of an acute episode taking medication as prescribed talking to others about the condition There are many charities and support groups offering help and advice on living with schizophrenia. Most people find it comforting talking to others with a similar condition. Read more about living with schizophrenia. Misconceptions about schizophrenia Split personality It is commonly thought people with schizophrenia have a split personality, acting perfectly normally one minute and irrationally or bizarrely the next \u2013 this is not true. Violent behaviour Some people mistakenly equate schizophrenia with violent behaviour, but people with the condition are rarely dangerous. Any violent behaviour is usually sparked off by illegal drugs or alcohol, which is the same for people who don't have schizophrenia.

The sciatic nerve is the longest nerve in your body. It runs from the back of your pelvis, through your buttocks, and all the way down both legs, ending at your feet. Signs and symptoms When the sciatic nerve is compressed or irritated, it can cause pain, numbness and a tingling sensation that radiates from your lower back and travels down one of your legs to your foot and toes. The pain can range from being mild to very painful, and may be made worse by sneezing, coughing, or sitting for a long period of time. Some people with sciatica may also experience muscle weakness in the affected leg. While people with sciatica can also have general back pain, the pain associated with sciatica usually affects the buttocks and legs much more than the back. When to see your GP Most people find their sciatic pain goes away naturally within a few weeks, although some cases can last for a year or more. You should see your GP if your symptoms are severe or persistent, or are getting worse over time. Your GP will usually be able to confirm a diagnosis of sciatica based on your symptoms and recommend suitable treatments. If necessary, they can refer you to a specialist for further investigation. You should immediately call 999 for an ambulance if you experience loss of sensation between your legs and around your buttocks and\/or loss of bladder or bowel control. Although it is rare, these symptoms can be a sign of a serious condition called cauda equina syndrome. Read more about diagnosing sciatica. What causes sciatica? In the vast majority of cases, sciatica is caused by a herniated or \"slipped\" disc. This is when one of the discs that sit between the bones of the spine (the vertebrae) is damaged and presses on the nerves. Less common causes include spinal stenosis (narrowing of the nerve passages in the spine), a spinal injury or infection, or a growth within the spine (such as a tumour). You can minimise your risk of developing a slipped disc or back injury that could lead to sciatica by adopting a better posture and lifting techniques at work, as well as stretching before and after exercise, and exercising regularly. Read more about the causes of sciatica and preventing sciatica. How sciatica is treated Many cases of sciatica will pass in around six weeks without the need for treatment. However, a combination of things you can do at home \u2013 such as taking over-the-counter painkillers, exercising and using hot or cold packs \u2013 may help reduce the symptoms until the condition improves. In more persistent cases, you may be advised to follow a structured exercise programme under the supervision of a physiotherapist, have injections of anti-inflammatory and painkilling medication into your spine, and\/or take stronger painkiller tablets. In rare cases, surgery may be needed to correct the problem in your spine. Read more about treating sciatica. Sciatica Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

Scleroderma is caused by the immune system attacking the connective tissue under the skin and around internal organs and blood vessels. This causes scarring and thickening of the tissue in these areas. There are several different types of scleroderma that can vary in severity. Some types are relatively mild and may eventually improve on their own, while others can lead to severe and life-threatening problems. There's no cure for scleroderma, but most people with the condition can lead a full, productive life. The symptoms of scleroderma can usually be controlled by a range of different treatments. This page covers: Types of scleroderma and typical symptoms  Causes of scleroderma  How scleroderma is treated  Living with scleroderma  Information about you Types of scleroderma and typical symptoms  There are two main types of scleroderma: localised scleroderma \u2013 just affects the skin systemic sclerosis \u2013 may affect blood circulation and internal organs as well as the skin Localised scleroderma Localised scleroderma is the mildest form of the condition. It often affects children, but can occur at any age. This type just affects the skin, causing one or more hard patches to develop. Internal organs aren't affected. Exactly how the skin is affected depends on the type of localised scleroderma. There are two types, called morphoea and linear. Morphoea: discoloured oval patches on the skin can appear anywhere on the body usually itchy patches may be hairless and shiny may improve after a few years and treatment may not be needed Linear: thickened skin occurs in lines along the face, scalp, legs or arms occasionally affects underlying bone and muscle may improve after a few years, although can cause permanent growth problems, such as shortened limbs Systemic sclerosis In systemic sclerosis, internal organs can be affected as well as the skin. This type mostly affects women and usually develops between 30 and 50 years of age. Children are rarely affected. There are two types of systemic sclerosis, called limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis and diffuse systemic sclerosis. Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis: a milder form that only affects skin on the hands, lower arms, feet, lower legs and face, although it can eventually affect the lungs and digestive system too often starts as Raynaud's phenomenon (a circulation problem where fingers and toes turn white in the cold)   other typical symptoms include thickening of the skin over the hands, feet and face, red spots on the skin, hard lumps under the skin, heartburn and problems swallowing (dysphagia) tends to get gradually worse over time, although it's generally less severe than diffuse systemic sclerosis and can often be controlled with treatment Diffuse systemic sclerosis: is more likely to affect internal organs skin changes can affect the whole body other symptoms can include weight loss, fatigue and joint pain and stiffness symptoms come on suddenly and get worse quickly over the first few years, but then the condition normally settles and the skin may gradually improve In some cases of systemic sclerosis, organs such as the heart, lungs or kidneys are affected. This can cause a range of potentially serious problems, such as shortness of breath, high blood pressure and pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs). Causes of scleroderma  Normally, the body's immune system fights off any germs that infect the body. It responds like this to anything in the body it doesn't recognise, and settles down when the infection has been cleared. It's thought scleroderma occurs because part of the immune system has become overactive and out of control. This leads to cells in the connective tissue producing too much collagen, causing scarring and thickening (fibrosis) of the tissue. It's not clear why this happens. Certain genes are thought to be involved, and having a close family member with the condition may increase your risk. How scleroderma is treated The aim of treatment is to relieve symptoms, prevent the condition getting worse, detect and treat any complications (such as pulmonary hypertension) and help you maintain the use of affected parts of the body. Common treatments include: medication to improve circulation medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system and slow the progression of the condition steroid medication to relieve joint and muscle problems moisturising affected areas of skin to help keep it supple and relieve itchiness various medicines to control other symptoms (such as pain, heartburn and high blood pressure) You will also need regular blood pressure checks and other tests to check for any problems with your organs. If your symptoms are severe, surgery may be needed. For example, hard lumps under the skin may need to be removed, and tightened muscles may need to be loosened. Newer treatments such as laser therapy and photodynamic therapy are currently being trialled (see Scleroderma clinical trials), and may improve the outcome of the condition for many people.  Living with scleroderma There are many therapies and lifestyle changes that can help reduce the impact of scleroderma on your life. Regular physiotherapy and stretching exercises may help keep your muscles supple and loosen tight skin. An occupational therapist can help you adapt to any movement difficulties by suggesting changes to your home and advising you on equipment to make daily life easier. If you're affected by Raynaud's phenomenon, you'll need to keep your hands and feet warm in the cold by wearing thick gloves and socks. Read more about treating Raynaud's phenomenon. It's important to eat healthily, exercise regularly and stop smoking (if you smoke) to keep blood pressure under control and improve your circulation. Read more about controlling high blood pressure. Many people find it helps to read up on the condition and talk to other people who are affected. Scleroderma & Raynaud's UK (SRUK) is dedicated to improving the lives of people affected by Scleroderma and Raynaud\u2019s. Information about you If you have scleroderma, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Systemic sclerosis and pregnancy Women with systemic sclerosis may find it harder to get pregnant and could have a slightly higher risk of miscarriage and giving birth prematurely. However, if the pregnancy is planned in consultation with a doctor during a period when the condition is stable, there's no reason why a woman with systemic sclerosis cannot have a successful pregnancy. The Scleroderma Society has more information about systemic sclerosis and pregnancy.

It is usually first noticed by a change in appearance of the back. Typical signs include: a visibly curved spine one shoulder being higher than the other one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other clothes not hanging properly a prominent ribcage a difference in leg lengths Back pain is common in adults with scoliosis. Young people with scoliosis may also experience some discomfort but it's less likely to be severe. Seeking medical advice If you or your child have signs of scoliosis, make an appointment to see your GP. They can examine your back and can refer you for an X-ray for confirmation. If you or your child are diagnosed with scoliosis, it's important to see a scoliosis specialist to talk about treatment options. Read more about diagnosing scoliosis. What causes scoliosis? In around eight out of every 10 cases, a cause for scoliosis is not found. This is known as idiopathic scoliosis. A small number of cases are caused by other medical conditions, including: cerebral palsy \u2013 a condition  associated with brain damage muscular dystrophy \u2013 a genetic condition that causes muscle weakness  Marfan syndrome \u2013 a disorder of the connective tissues Rarely, babies can be born with scoliosis, as a result of a problem with the development of the spine in the womb. In adults, age related changes in the discs and joints of the spine and a reduction in bone density may cause scoliosis. Adults can also experience worsening over time of previously undiagnosed or untreated scoliosis. Read more about the causes of scoliosis. Who is affected It used to be thought that scoliosis was only a childhood condition, but it\u2019s now increasingly recognised as a condition that affects older adults as well. It can develop at any age, but is most common in children aged 10-15. In the UK, around three or four in every 1,000 children need treatment for scoliosis. It's more common in females than males. How scoliosis is treated Treatment for scoliosis depends on your age, how severe it is, and whether it\u2019s thought it will worsen with time. In very young children, treatment is not always necessary because the curvature of the spine may improve naturally as they get older. If treatment is necessary, bracing or casting may be used to attempt to halt the curve\u2019s progression. If the infant or younger child's curve continues to progress despite bracing or casting, an operation may be necessary. This will usually involve inserting metal rods into the back to stabilise the spine, which are lengthened at regular intervals as your child grows. In older children and adults, it is unlikely that scoliosis will improve with time, and in some it may progressively worsen. The main treatments for older children are: a back brace worn until they stop growing, to prevent the spine from curving further surgery to correct the curvature \u2013 where the spine is straightened using rods attached to the spine by screws, hooks and\/or wires In adults, treatment primarily aims to relieve any pain. Non-surgical options, such as painkillers and exercises are often tried first, with correctional surgery seen as a last resort. Read more about treating scoliosis in children and treating scoliosis in adults. Further problems Scoliosis can sometimes lead to further emotional and physical problems. Having a visibly curved spine or wearing a back brace can cause problems related to body image, self-esteem and overall quality of life. This is particularly the case for children and teenagers with scoliosis. If this is a problem for you or your child, you may find it useful to contact a scoliosis support group, such as Scoliosis Association UK. These groups are a good source of information and support for people with scoliosis. In rare cases, scoliosis can lead to physical problems if it's severe. For example, significant curvature of the spine can sometimes put increased pressure on the heart and lungs. Read more about the possible complications of scoliosis.

This page gives an overview of screening, with links to the different types of screening offered by the NHS in England. What is screening? What types of screening are offered by the NHS in England? Benefits, risks and limitations of screening What is screening? Screening is a way of identifying apparently healthy people who may have an increased risk of a particular condition. The NHS offers a range of screening tests to different sections of the population. The aim is to offer screening to the people who are most likely to benefit from it. For example, some screening tests are only offered to newborn babies, while others such as breast screening and abdominal aortic aneurysm screening are only offered to older people. Screening results If you get a normal result (a screen negative result) after a screening test, this means you are at low risk of having the condition you were screened for. This does not mean that you will never develop the condition in the future, just that you are low risk at the moment. If you have a higher-risk result (a screen positive result), it means you may have the condition that you've been tested for. At this point, you will be offered further tests (called diagnostic tests) to confirm if you have the condition. You can then be offered treatment, advice and support. Finding out about a problem early can mean that treatment is more effective. However, screening tests are not perfect and they can lead to difficult decisions about having further tests or treatment. Read on to find out about the benefits, risks and limitations of screening. What types of screening are offered by the NHS in England? An independent expert group called the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) advises the NHS, in all four UK countries, on which screening programmes to offer. The NHS screening programmes currently offered in England are listed below. For more detailed information on each type of screening, follow the links. You can also view screening timelines. Screening in pregnancy Pregnant women are offered the following types of screening: screening for infectious diseases (hepatitis B, HIV and syphilis)  screening for Down's syndrome, Patau's syndrome and Edwards' syndrome  screening for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia  screening for physical abnormalities (mid-pregnancy scan)  Screening for newborn babies Newborn babies are offered: a physical examination, which includes the eyes, heart, hips and testes a hearing test a blood spot test to check if the baby has any of nine rare conditions Diabetic eye screening From the age of 12, all people with diabetes are offered an annual diabetic eye test to check for early signs of diabetic retinopathy.   Cervical screening Cervical screening is offered to women aged 25 to 64 to check the health of cells in the cervix. It is offered every three years for those aged 26 to 49, and every five years from the ages of 50 to 64. Breast screening Breast screening is offered to women aged 50 to 70 to detect early signs of breast cancer. Women over 70 can self-refer. Bowel cancer screening There are two types of screening for bowel cancer. A home testing kit is offered to men and women aged 60 to 74. Bowel scope screening uses a thin, flexible tube with a tiny camera on the end to look at the large bowel. It is offered to men and women at the age of 55 in some parts of England. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening AAA screening is offered to men in their 65th year to detect abdominal aortic aneurysms (a dangerous swelling in the aorta). Men over 65 can self-refer. Benefits, risks and limitations of screening Making an informed choice Before having any screening test, it's worth finding out about the test itself and what would happen next if you found out you have a higher risk of a particular condition. Deciding whether or not to have a screening test is a personal choice and one which only you can make. When you are invited for screening, you will receive an information leaflet about the screening test. You can discuss any aspect of the screening test with your health professional and decide whether or not it's right for you. Different types of screening have different benefits and risks. Some of these are listed below. The benefits of having a screening test include: Screening can detect a problem early, before you have any symptoms. Finding out about a problem early can mean that treatment is more effective. Finding out you have a health problem or an increased risk of a health problem can help people make better informed decisions about their health. Screening can reduce the risk of developing a condition or its complications. Screening can save lives. The risks and limitations of screening include: Screening tests are not 100% accurate. You could be told you have a problem when you don't \u2013 this is called a \"false positive\" and may lead to some people having unnecessary further tests or treatment as a result of screening. A screening test could also miss a problem \u2013 this is called a \"false negative\" and could lead to people ignoring symptoms in the future. Some screening tests can lead to difficult decisions. For example, if a pregnancy screening test tells you your baby has a higher risk of a particular condition, you may then be faced with a decision about having further diagnostic tests that involve a risk to your pregnancy. If the diagnostic test is positive, you may then need to decide whether to continue with your pregnancy. Finding out you may have a health problem can cause considerable anxiety. Even if your screening test result is normal or negative (i.e. you are not at high risk), you could still go on to develop the condition. How does the NHS decide which types of screening to offer? An expert group called the UK NSC advises the NHS on which screening programmes to offer. When considering who to screen and which conditions to screen for, the benefits of offering a screening programme are weighed up against the harms. The UK NSC only recommends screening when it believes the benefits to the group offered screening outweigh the harms. The UK NSC regularly reviews its recommendations on screening for different conditions as new research becomes available. This is usually done every three years. Find out how the UK NSC reviews evidence and monitors the quality of screening programmes. Private screening All screening tests provided by the NHS are free. Private companies offer a range of screening tests that you have to pay for. Some of the tests on offer are not recommended by the UK NSC because it is not clear that the benefits outweigh the harms. The UK NSC has produced a downloadable leaflet on private screening. Confidentiality and use of data By law, everyone working in, or on behalf of, the NHS must respect your privacy and keep all information about you safe. The NHS Constitution sets out how the NHS should handle your records to protect your privacy. There are also laws in place to ensure that confidentiality is maintained. Screening records are only shared with staff who need to see them, such as technicians carrying out screening, your GP and any clinicians involved in follow-up tests and treatment. Anonymised data is sometimes used for research purposes to improve screening outcomes and the quality of services provided by the NHS.  Read more about screening data and confidentiality. Further information about screening Questions about screening results For pregnancy or baby screening results, contact your midwife or health visitor. For abdominal aortic aneurism or diabetic eye screening, contact your GP or your local screening programme. For breast screening, cervical screening or bowel cancer screening, contact your GP, who should receive a copy of your results. You can also contact your local breast screening unit, or call the bowel cancer screening helpline on 0800 707 6060. Questions about symptoms Speak to your GP if you have any concerns about your health or need to ask about a family history of cancer.

This swelling is far more common in men aged over 65 than it is in women and younger men, so men are invited for screening in the year they turn 65. An AAA usually causes no symptoms, but if it bursts, it\u2019s extremely dangerous and usually fatal. Around 8 out of 10 people with a ruptured AAA either die before they reach hospital or don\u2019t survive surgery. Read more about abdominal aortic aneurysm. Screening involves a simple ultrasound scan of your stomach (abdomen), which takes about 10-15 minutes. If your abdominal aorta is not enlarged, you don\u2019t ever need to be tested again. If you have a small to medium aneurysm, you'll be regularly monitored to check it doesn\u2019t get dangerously larger. If you are found to have a large aneurysm, you'll be seen by a vascular surgeon (a specialist in blood vessels) within two weeks. They will advise on whether you would benefit from treatment to reduce the risk of it bursting. Why have AAA screening? An AAA is sometimes picked up by chance \u2013 for instance, if you\u2019re being tested for another condition. In general, if you have an AAA, you won\u2019t know. You probably won\u2019t feel any pain or notice anything different. But if the aneurysm bursts, it\u2019s a medical emergency, and most people either die before they reach hospital or don\u2019t survive surgery. Screening is a way of detecting an aneurysm early. If a large aneurysm is detected before it bursts it can be treated. Accepting the invitation to screening cuts the risk of dying from an abdominal aortic aneurysm by about half. The NHS AAA Screening Programme was set up in England in 2009 and has been offered throughout the UK since the end of 2013. Read more about why screening is offered.  When AAA screening is offered Men aged over 65 are far more likely to have an AAA than women or younger men \u2013 so any man registered with a GP will receive a letter inviting him for screening in the year he turns 65. Men aged over 65 can request a scan by contacting their local AAA screening service directly. Read more about when AAA screening is offered.  What happens during AAA screening? The screening test for AAA is a simple, pain-free ultrasound scan of the abdomen that usually takes about 10-15 minutes. The screening technician will ask you to lift up your shirt and then run a small ultrasound scanner on your abdomen, which will allow the thickness of your abdominal aorta to be measured on a monitor. The technician will tell you the result straight away and your GP will also be informed. Read more about what happens during AAA screening.  Results What happens next depends on the size of your abdominal aorta: If it\u2019s normal, you won\u2019t ever be invited for another screening. An aneurysm grows so slowly that you\u2019re unlikely to develop one after the age of 65. If you have a small to medium-sized aneurysm, you\u2019ll be invited back for regular scans to check its size. If you have a large AAA, you\u2019ll be referred to hospital to be seen by a vascular surgeon within two weeks. You will then be advised about treatment options but, generally, men with a large AAA are advised that the risk of a large aneurysm rupturing is more dangerous than having surgery to repair it.

If it's detected at an early stage, before symptoms appear, it's easier to treat and there's a better chance of surviving it. To detect cases of bowel cancer sooner, the NHS offers two types of bowel cancer screening to adults registered with a GP in England: All men and women aged 60-74 are invited to carry out a faecal occult blood (FOB) test. Every two years, they're sent a home test kit, which is used to collect a stool sample. If you are 75 or over, you can ask for this test by calling the freephone helpline on 0800 707 60 60. An additional one-off test called bowel scope screening is gradually being introduced in England. This is offered to men and women at the age of 55. As of March 2015, about two-thirds of screening centres were beginning to offer this test to 55-year-olds. It involves a doctor or nurse using a thin, flexible instrument to look inside the lower part of the bowel.  Taking part in bowel cancer screening reduces your chances of dying from bowel cancer, and removing polyps in bowel scope screening can prevent cancer. However, all screening involves a balance of potential harms, as well as benefits. It's up to you to decide if you want to have it. To help you decide, read on to learn about what the two tests involve, what the different possible results mean, and the potential risks for you to weigh up. What does the FOB screening test involve? The home testing kit is used to collect tiny stool samples on a special card. The card is then sealed in a hygienic freepost envelope and sent to the screening laboratory, where it will be checked for traces of blood that may not be visible to the naked eye, but could be an early sign of bowel cancer. For more information, read what the FOB screening test involves. Your results You'll receive the results of your FOB test within two weeks of sending in the test kit. There are three types of result: Most people will have a normal result \u2013 no further tests are needed and you'll be invited to take part in screening again in two years (if you're still aged 60-74). A few people will have an unclear result \u2013 you'll be asked to repeat the FOB test up to twice more. A few people will have an abnormal result \u2013 you'll be offered an appointment to discuss colonoscopy at a local screening centre. Read more about FOB test results. If you're outside the age range... People aged 75 and older can still be screened for bowel cancer. They can request an FOB screening kit by calling the freephone helpline on 0800 707 60 60. People younger than 60 are not eligible for the FOB screening test, but can have bowel scope screening (see below). If you have symptoms, are worried about a family history of bowel cancer, or are worried about your bowel health in any way, speak to your GP. What does bowel scope screening involve? Bowel scope screening is done by a specially trained nurse or doctor at an NHS bowel cancer screening centre. The doctor or nurse will put a thin flexible tube into your bottom to look inside the lower part of your bowel and remove any small growths, called polyps, that could eventually turn into cancer. Read more about bowel scope screening. Your results You'll receive the results of your bowel scope screening test within two weeks of your appointment.  Most people will have a normal result. Some people will have polyps, which may mean having another examination of the bowel (a colonoscopy). Rarely, the test will find cancer. Read more about bowel scope screening results. What are the risks? No screening test is 100% reliable. There's a chance a cancer can be missed if it was not bleeding when the screening test was taken. This means you might be falsely reassured. Bowel scope screening is usually safe, but in rare cases it can cause harm to the bowel. Learn more about the risks of bowel scope screening. If you get an abnormal result, you'll be offered a colonoscopy. Although rare, there are risks associated with having this investigation. Most people who have a colonoscopy will not have cancer.

Breast screening aims to find breast cancers early. It uses an X-ray test called a mammogram that can spot cancers when they are too small to see or feel. Breast screening does, however, have some risks you should be aware of (see below). As the likelihood of getting breast cancer increases with age, all women who are aged 50-70 and registered with a GP are automatically invited for breast cancer screening every three years. In the meantime, if you are worried about breast cancer symptoms, such as a lump or area of thickened tissue in a breast, don't wait to be offered screening \u2013 see your GP. This page gives an overview of breast cancer screening, with links to information on why and when it is offered, what happens when you go for breast screening, and receiving your results. Why is breast screening offered? Most experts agree that regular breast screening is beneficial in identifying breast cancer early. The earlier the condition is found, the better the chances of surviving it. You're also less likely to need a mastectomy (breast removal) or chemotherapy if breast cancer is detected at an early stage. The main risk is that breast screening sometimes picks up cancers that may not have caused any symptoms or become life-threatening. You may end up having unnecessary extra tests and treatment. Read about the pros and cons of breast cancer screening. When will I be offered breast screening? Breast screening is currently offered to women aged 50-70 in England. However, the NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47-73. You will first be invited for screening between your 50th and 53rd birthday, although in some areas you'll be invited from the age of 47 as part of the trial extension of the programme. You may be eligible for breast screening before the age of 50 if you have a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer (for more information, read 'If you have a family history of breast cancer'). If you're over the age of 70, you'll stop receiving screening invitations. However, you're still eligible for screening and can arrange an appointment by contacting your local screening unit. For more information, read when breast cancer screening is offered. Find breast screening units in your area. What happens during breast screening? Breast screening is carried out at special clinics or mobile breast screening units. The procedure is carried out by female members of staff who take mammograms. During screening, your breasts will be X-rayed one at a time. The breast is placed on the X-ray machine and gently but firmly compressed with a clear plate. Two X-rays are taken of each breast at different angles. For more information, read what happens during breast cancer screening.  When will I receive my results? After your breasts have been X-rayed, the mammogram will be checked for any abnormalities. The results of the mammogram will be sent to you and your GP no later than two weeks after your appointment. Following screening, about one in 25 women will be called back for further assessment. Being called back doesn't mean you definitely have cancer. The first mammogram may have been unclear. About one in four women who are called back for further assessment are diagnosed with breast cancer. Read our page on understanding your results.

The cervix is the entrance to the womb from the vagina. Detecting and removing abnormal cervical cells can prevent cervical cancer. Cervical screening isn't a test for cancer; it's a test to check the health of the cells of the cervix. Most women's test results show that everything is normal, but for around 1 in 20 women the test shows some abnormal changes in the cells of the cervix. Most of these changes won't lead to cervical cancer and the cells may go back to normal on their own. However, in some cases, the abnormal cells need to be removed so they can't become cancerous. About 3,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK. It's possible for women of all ages to develop cervical cancer, although the condition mainly affects sexually active women aged 30 to 45. The condition is very rare in women under 25. The cervical screening programme The aim of the NHS Cervical Screening Programme is to reduce the number of women who develop cervical cancer and the number of women who die from the condition. Since the screening programme was introduced in the 1980s, the number of cervical cancer cases has decreased by about 7% each year. All women who are registered with a GP are invited for cervical screening: aged 25 to 49 \u2013 every three years aged 50 to 64 \u2013 every five years over 65 \u2013 only women who haven't been screened since age 50 or those who have recently had abnormal tests Being screened regularly means any abnormal changes in the cells of the cervix can be identified at an early stage and, if necessary, treated to stop cancer developing. However, cervical screening isn't 100% accurate and doesn't prevent all cases of cervical cancer. Screening is a personal choice and you have the right to choose not to attend. Read about: why cervical screening is offered when cervical screening is offered What happens when you go for cervical screening? Booking your test You'll receive a letter through the post asking you to make an appointment for a cervical screening test. The letter should contain the details of the place you need to contact for the appointment. Most women choose to go to their GP practice, although it may also be available at a well woman clinic or sexual health clinic. Screening is usually carried out by the practice nurse. You can ask to have a female doctor or nurse. If possible, try to book an appointment during the middle of your menstrual cycle (usually 14 days from the start of your last period), as this can ensure a better sample of cells is taken. If you use a spermicide, a barrier method of contraception or a lubricant jelly, you shouldn't use these for 24 hours before the test, as the chemicals they contain may affect the test. Your screening appointment The cervical screening test usually takes around five minutes to carry out. You'll be asked to undress from the waist down and lie on a couch, although you can usually remain fully dressed if you're wearing a loose skirt. The doctor or nurse will gently put an instrument, called a speculum, into your vagina. This holds the walls of the vagina open so the cervix can be seen. A small soft brush will be used to gently collect some cells from the surface of your cervix. Some women find the procedure a bit uncomfortable or embarrassing, but for most women it's not painful. If you find the test painful, tell the doctor or nurse, because they may be able to reduce your discomfort. Try to relax as much as possible, because being tense makes the test more difficult to carry out. Taking slow, deep breaths will help. The cell sample is then sent off to a laboratory for analysis and you should receive the result within two weeks. HPV testing Changes in the cells of the cervix are often caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). There are more than 100 different types of HPV. Some types are high risk and some types are low risk. HPV-16 and HPV-18 are considered to be highest risk for cervical cancer. After successful trials, HPV testing has been incorporated into the NHS Cervical Screening Programme. If a sample taken during the cervical screening test shows low-grade or borderline cell abnormalities, the sample should automatically be tested for HPV. If HPV is found in your sample, you should be referred for a colposcopy for further investigation and, if necessary, treatment. If no HPV is found, you'll carry on being routinely screened as normal. If your sample shows more significant cell changes, you'll be referred for colposcopy without HPV testing. In some areas, a test for HPV is the first test on the screening sample. In these cases, the sample is only checked for abnormal cells if HPV is found. If HPV isn\u2019t found, you'll be offered a screening test again in three to five years (depending on your age).

Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most common causes of sight loss among people of working age. It occurs when diabetes affects small blood vessels, damaging the part of the eye called the retina. When the blood vessels in the central area of the retina (the macula) are affected, it's known as diabetic maculopathy. People with diabetes should also see their optician every two years for a regular eye test. Diabetic eye screening is specifically for diabetic retinopathy and can't be relied upon for other conditions. This page covers: Why it's needed When it's offered Eye screening in pregnancy What happens during screening Results Private screening Why eye screening is needed Screening is a way of detecting the condition early before you notice any changes to your vision. Diabetic retinopathy doesn't usually cause any noticeable symptoms in the early stages. If retinopathy is detected early enough, treatment can stop it getting worse. Otherwise, by the time symptoms become noticeable, it can be much more difficult to treat. This is why the NHS Diabetic Eye Screening Programme was introduced. Everyone aged 12 and over with diabetes is offered screening once a year. Diabetic retinopathy is extremely unusual in children with diabetes who are under the age of 12.  The check takes about half an hour and involves examining the back of the eyes and taking photographs of the retina. When diabetic eye screening is offered Everyone with diabetes who is 12 years of age or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year. You should receive a letter from your local Diabetic Eye Screening Service inviting you to attend a screening appointment. The letter will include a leaflet about diabetic eye screening. People with diabetes can opt out of the screening programme if they choose. They should confirm this decision in writing to the screening service that has invited them for diabetic eye screening Contact your local screening service or your GP if you haven't received a letter and your appointment is overdue. You can look up your local screening service here \u2013 your service will be the one nearest to your GP surgery. The invitation will say where you need to go. This may be your GP surgery, your local hospital, a local optician's practice, or another nearby clinic. Bring all the glasses and contact lenses you wear, along with lens solution for contacts. If you have sight problems in between screening appointments, such as sudden vision loss or a deterioration in your vision, seek immediate medical advice. Don't wait until your next screening appointment. Diabetic eye screening in pregnancy If you have diabetes and become pregnant, you'll need special care as there are risks to both mother and baby associated with the condition. You'll be offered additional tests for diabetic retinopathy at or soon after your first antenatal clinic visit, and also after 28 weeks of pregnancy. If the early stages of retinopathy are found at the first screening, you'll also be offered another test between 16 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. If serious retinopathy is found at any screening, you'll be referred to an eye specialist. Some women who don't have diabetes can develop hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) during pregnancy. This is known as gestational diabetes. Pregnant women who develop gestational diabetes aren't offered screening for diabetic retinopathy. What happens during diabetic eye screening The screening appointment should last about 30 minutes. When you arrive, the procedure will be explained to you. If you have any questions, ask the healthcare professional who is treating you. You'll be given eye drops to enlarge your pupils, which takes between 15 and 20 minutes, and photographs of your retina will be taken.   There will be a flash of light each time a photograph is taken, but the camera won't touch your eye. Although the light is bright, it shouldn't be uncomfortable. The eye drops may cause your eyes to sting slightly, and after about 15 minutes your vision will be blurred. You may find it difficult to focus on objects that are close to you. Depending on the type of eye drops used, the blurring can last between two and six hours. You won't be able to drive home from your appointment, so you may want to bring someone with you. After the screening procedure, you may also find that everything looks very bright. You may want to take a pair of sunglasses to wear afterwards. Side effects In very rare cases, the eye drops can cause a sudden pressure increase within the eye. This requires prompt treatment at an eye unit. The symptoms of a pressure increase are: pain or severe discomfort in your eye redness of the white of your eye constantly blurred vision, sometimes with rainbow halos around lights If you experience any of these symptoms after screening, go back to the screening centre or your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Your screening results Within six weeks, both you and your GP should receive a letter letting you know your results. You won't get the results immediately as the photographs need to be studied by a number of different healthcare professionals, including someone who is trained in identifying and grading retinopathy. The screening results may show either: no retinopathy background retinopathy \u2013 also called stage one retinopathy degrees of referable retinopathy \u2013 this means retinopathy that requires referral to an eye specialist for further assessment and treatment You may need to have a further assessment if: the photographs aren't clear enough to give an accurate result you have retinopathy that could affect your sight and follow-up treatment is needed you have retinopathy that needs to be checked more than once a year other eye conditions are detected, such as glaucoma (a group of eye conditions that affect vision) or cataracts (cloudy patches in the lens of the eye) If your results show no retinopathy or background retinopathy, you'll be invited back for another screening appointment a year later. You can also reduce your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy in the future by controlling your blood sugar levels and blood pressure. Read more about preventing diabetic retinopathy. If screening detects signs that diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy is threatening your sight, you'll be given information about how far the condition has progressed. This will determine the type of treatment you receive. Read about the treatment options for diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy. If you have questions about your results, contact your local diabetic eye screening service. Their details should be on the letter you received from them. Alternatively, you can find your local screening service here. Private screening for diabetic retinopathy Eye checks for diabetic retinopathy are available privately but they won't necessarily be quality-assured in the same way as the NHS Diabetic Eye Screening Programme. If you're considering private screening, check that the company is properly regulated and ask for clear written information about the benefits as well as the risks of any tests offered. Find further information in the UK National Screening Committee's leaflet on private screening. Diabetic retinopathy screening Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

Newborn blood spot screening involves taking a blood sample to find out if your baby has one of nine rare but serious health conditions. Most babies screened won't have any of these conditions but, for the few who do, the benefits of screening are enormous. Early treatment can improve their health and prevent severe disability, and even death. What does the blood spot test involve? When your baby is five days old, a health professional will prick their heel using a special device and collect four drops of blood on a special card. You can minimise any distress to your baby by cuddling and feeding them, and making sure they are warm and comfortable. Occasionally, the sample may need to be taken when your baby is six, seven or eight days old. Sometimes a second blood spot sample is needed. The reason for this will be explained to you. It doesn't necessarily mean there is something wrong with your baby. The test doesn't carry any known risks for your baby. Which conditions is the blood spot test for? The blood spot test screens for the following nine rare but serious conditions. If you, your partner, or a family member already has one of these conditions (or a family history of it), please tell your health professional straight away. Sickle cell disease About 1 in 2,000 babies born in the UK has sickle cell disease. This is a serious inherited blood disease. Sickle cell disease affects haemoglobin, the iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body. Babies who have this condition will need specialist care throughout their lives. People with sickle cell disease can have attacks of severe pain and get serious, life-threatening infections. They are usually anaemic because their blood cells have difficulty carrying oxygen. The blood spot screening test means that babies with sickle cell disease can receive early treatment to help them live healthier lives. This may include vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent serious illnesses. Pregnant women are also routinely tested for sickle cell disease early in pregnancy. Read more about sickle cell disease, or download leaflets for parents whose child has sickle cell disease. Cystic fibrosis About 1 in 2,500 babies born in the UK has cystic fibrosis. This inherited condition affects the digestion and lungs. Babies with cystic fibrosis may not gain weight well and frequently have chest infections. Babies with the condition can be treated early with a high-energy diet, medicines, and physiotherapy. Although children with cystic fibrosis may still become very ill, early treatment can help them live longer, healthier lives. Read more about cystic fibrosis, or download a leaflet for parents whose baby has suspected cystic fibrosis. Congenital hypothyroidism About 1 in 3,000 babies born in the UK has congenital hypothyroidism. Babies with congenital hypothyroidism do not have enough of the hormone thyroxine. Without thyroxine, babies do not grow properly and can develop learning disabilities. Babies who have the condition can be treated early with thyroxine tablets, and this allows them to develop normally. See more information about congenital hypothyroidism (CHT). Inherited metabolic diseases It is important to let your health professional know if you have a family history of a metabolic disease (a disease that affects your metabolism). Babies are screened for six inherited metabolic diseases. These are: phenylketonuria (PKU) medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)  isovaleric acidaemia (IVA)  glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1)  homocystinuria (pyridoxine unresponsive) (HCU)  About 1 in 10,000 babies born in the UK has PKU or MCADD. The other conditions are rarer, occurring in 1 in 100,000 to 150,000 babies. Without treatment, babies with inherited metabolic diseases can become suddenly and seriously ill. The diseases all have different symptoms. Depending on which one affects your baby, the condition may be life threatening or cause severe developmental problems. They can all be treated with a carefully managed diet and, in some cases, medicines as well. What are amino acids? Our bodies break down protein foods like meat and fish into amino acids (the building blocks of protein). Any amino acids that aren't needed are usually broken down and removed from the body. Babies with the inherited metabolic diseases that are screened for are unable to break down one or more amino acids. When levels of these amino acids get very high, they are harmful. Does my baby have to have the blood spot test? It's not compulsory, but it's recommended because it could save your baby's life.  You can choose to have screening for sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis or congenital hypothyroidism individually but you can only choose to have screening for all six inherited metabolic diseases or none at all. If you don't want your baby to be screened for any of these conditions, discuss it with your midwife. You should be given information about the blood spot test and the diseases it screens for in advance so you can make an informed decision for your baby. If you change your mind, babies can be screened up to the age of 12 months for all the conditions except cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis can only be screened for up to eight weeks of age. If you have any concerns about the tests, speak to your midwife, health visitor, or GP. When will we get the results? You should receive the results either by letter or from a health professional by the time your baby is six to eight weeks old. The results should be recorded in your baby's personal child health record (red book). It's important to keep this safe and take it with you to all your baby's appointments. If you have not received your baby's results, speak to your health visitor or GP. You will be contacted sooner if your baby screens positive. This means they're more likely to have one of the conditions tested for. If your baby is thought to have congenital hypothyroidism (CHT) or an inherited metabolic disease, you will be contacted the day the result is available, or the next working day, and given an appointment to see a specialist. If your baby is thought to have cystic fibrosis, you will be contacted before they are four weeks old. If your baby is thought to have sickle cell disease, you will be contacted before they are six weeks old. Screening for cystic fibrosis finds some babies who may be genetic carriers of the condition. These babies may need further testing. Screening for sickle cell disease also finds babies who are carriers of this or other red blood cell diseases. Carriers are healthy, although they can experience problems in situations where their bodies aren't getting much oxygen \u2013 for example, if they are having an anaesthetic. Parents of babies who are found to be carriers should be told by the time they are six to eight weeks old. Read more about what being a carrier means. What do the results mean? Most babies will have a normal result, which means it's unlikely that they have any of the conditions. A small number of babies will screen positive for one of the conditions. This doesn't mean they have the condition, but they are more likely to have it. They will be referred to a specialist for further tests. It's important to know that screening is not 100% certain. A baby with a negative screening result may later turn out to have the disease screened for. This is known as a false negative. Babies with a positive result sometimes turn out not to have the disease \u2013 what's known as a false positive. Occasionally, other medical conditions are picked up by blood spot test screening. For example, babies with beta thalassaemia major (a serious blood disease) will usually be detected. These babies will also need to be referred for early treatment. If your baby's blood spot test is positive The NHS screening programme has produced leaflets for parents who have been told their baby may have one of the conditions screened for. The leaflets provide information about the condition, further tests your baby may be offered, and what treatment is needed. They also answer parents' questions, including where to find support. See FAQs on blood spot screening. Find out what happens to your baby's blood spot card. The Screening Tests for You and Your Baby leaflet contains information about the blood spot screening test and the conditions it screens for. It is available in other languages.

This means parents can get the support and advice they need right from the start. One to two babies in every 1,000 are born with permanent hearing loss in one or both ears. This increases to about 1 in every 100 babies who have spent more than 48 hours in intensive care. Most of these babies are born into families with no history of permanent hearing loss. Permanent hearing loss can significantly affect a baby's development. Finding out early can give these babies a better chance of developing language, speech, and communication skills. It will also help babies make the most of relationships with their family or carers from an early age. When is the newborn hearing test done? If you give birth in hospital, you may be offered a newborn hearing test for your baby before you are discharged. In some areas it will be done by a health professional, healthcare assistant or health visitor within the first few weeks. You will be contacted by your local newborn hearing screening service to arrange a suitable time and venue. Ideally, the test is done in the first four to five weeks, but it can be done at up to three months of age. If you are not offered a screening test, ask your health visitor, local audiology department or GP to arrange an appointment, or contact your local newborn hearing screening service. How is the newborn hearing test done? The test is called the automated otoacoustic emission (AOAE) test. It takes just a few minutes. A small soft-tipped earpiece is placed in your baby's ear and gentle clicking sounds are played. When an ear receives sound, the inner part (called the cochlea) responds. This can be picked up by the screening equipment. It's not always possible to get clear responses from the first test. This happens with a lot of babies, and does not always mean your baby has a permanent hearing loss. It could mean: your baby was unsettled when the test was done there was background noise your baby has fluid or a temporary blockage in their ear In these cases your baby will be offered a second test. This may be the same as the first test, or another type called the automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) test. The AABR test involves placing three small sensors on your baby's head and neck. Soft headphones are placed over your baby's ears and gentle clicking sounds are played. This test takes between 5 and 15 minutes. These tests will not harm your baby in any way. Does my baby have to have the newborn hearing test? It's highly recommended, but you don't have to accept it. If you decide not to have the screening test, you will be given checklists to help you check on your baby's hearing as they grow older. If you have any concerns, you should speak to your health visitor or GP. When will we get the results? You will be given your baby's hearing test results as soon as the test is done. If your baby has a clear response in both ears, they are unlikely to have permanent hearing loss. However, the newborn hearing test doesn't pick up all types of permanent hearing loss. Children can also develop permanent hearing loss later on, so it's important to check your child's hearing as they grow up. The checklist in your baby's personal child health record (red book) tells you how to do this. You can also download two checklists: one that tells you what sounds your baby should make, and another that tells you what sort of sounds your baby should react to. If you have any concerns about your child's hearing, tell your health visitor or GP. What does it mean if my baby is referred to a hearing specialist? If the screening test results do not show a clear response from one or both of your baby's ears, an appointment will be made with a hearing specialist at an audiology clinic. Even if this happens, it doesn't necessarily mean your baby has a permanent hearing loss. A hearing specialist should see you within four weeks of your baby's hearing test. It's very important that you attend the appointment in case your baby does have permanent hearing loss. The appointment will usually take about one to two hours. This includes time to settle your baby. If possible, feed your baby shortly before the hearing test. Make sure you have the things you may need to keep them comfortable and happy. The tests will not hurt or be uncomfortable for your baby, and you will be able to stay with your baby while the tests are done. You may want to take your partner or a friend or relative with you to the appointment. The tests look similar to those used for your baby's screening tests, but give more detailed information about your baby's hearing. Your audiologist will usually be able to explain the results at the end of the appointment. They will explain what the results mean for your baby's hearing and whether any further tests are necessary. What does it mean if my baby has permanent hearing loss? Types and levels of permanent hearing loss vary. Each baby's hearing loss will be different. There is a range of support and information available, including leaflets on the different types of hearing loss: Your baby has a hearing loss Your baby has hearing loss in one ear Your baby has a mild hearing loss You can also contact the National Deaf Children's Society (NDCS) freephone helpline on 0808 800 8880 (voice and text).

This includes babies who are born at home. This examination includes specific screening tests to find out if your baby has any problems with their eyes, heart, hips and, in boys, the testicles (testes). This examination is part of the Newborn and Infant Physical Examination (NIPE) screening programme. The newborn physical examination is usually carried out in hospital before you go home. Sometimes it's done at a hospital or community clinic, GP surgery, children's centre, or at home.  Ideally, both parents should be there when the examination is done. The health professional doing the examination should explain what it involves. This could be a doctor, midwife, nurse or health visitor, and they will have had specific training to undertake the examination. Some parts of the examination may be a little uncomfortable for your baby, but it won't cause them any pain. The aim is to spot any problems early so treatment can be started as soon as possible. Usually, nothing of concern is found. If the health professional carrying out the examination does find a possible problem, they may refer your baby for more tests. You will be offered another physical examination for your baby at six to eight weeks, as some of the conditions it screens for can take a while to develop. This second examination is usually done at your GP's surgery. How is the newborn physical examination done? The health professional will give your baby a thorough physical examination. They will also ask you questions about how your baby is feeding, how alert they are, and about their general wellbeing. Your baby will need to be undressed for part of the examination. During the examination, the health professional will also: look into your baby's eyes with a special torch called an ophthalmoscope to check how their eyes look and move listen to your baby's heart to check their heart sounds examine their hips to check the joints examine baby boys to see if their testicles are in the right place What does the newborn physical examination check for? The examination includes an overall physical check plus four different screening tests. Eyes The health professional will check the appearance and movement of your baby's eyes. They are looking for cataracts, which is a clouding of the transparent lens inside the eye, and other conditions. About 2 or 3 in 10,000 babies are born with problems with their eyes that require treatment. However, the examination can't tell you how well your baby can see. See how cataracts are diagnosed and treated.   Heart The health professional will also check your baby's heart. This is done by observing your baby, feeling your baby's pulses, and listening to their heart with a stethoscope. Sometimes heart murmurs are picked up. A heart murmur is where the heartbeat has an extra or unusual sound caused by a disturbed blood flow through the heart. Heart murmurs are common in babies. The heart is normal in almost all cases where a murmur is heard. However, about 1 in 200 babies has a heart problem that needs treatment. See more about diagnosing and treating heart problems in newborns. Hips Some newborns have hip joints that are not formed properly. This is known as developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Left untreated, this can cause a limp or joint problems. About 1 or 2 in 1,000 babies have DDH that needs treating. See more about developmental dysplasia of the hip. Testicles Baby boys are checked to make sure their testicles are in the right place. During pregnancy, the testicles form inside the baby's body. They may not drop down into the scrotum until a few months after birth. In about 1 in 100 baby boys, the testicles descend only partially or not at all. This needs treating to prevent possible problems later in life, such as reduced fertility. See more about undescended testicles. Does my baby have to have the examination? The aim of the examination is to identify any of the problems early so that treatment can be started as soon as possible. It's strongly recommended for your baby, but not compulsory. You can decide to have your baby examined and screened for any or all of the conditions. If you have any concerns, you should talk to your midwife or the health professional who is offering the examination. When will we get the results? The health professional carrying out the examination will give you the results straight away. If your baby needs referring for more tests, they will discuss this with you there and then, too.  The results will be recorded in your baby's personal child health record (red book). You'll need to keep this safe and have it to hand whenever your baby sees a health professional. If you have any concerns, you can discuss them with your midwife or the health professional who does the examination. Download a leaflet about screening tests for you and your baby.

In some areas it may be carried out later than 21 weeks. The scan checks for major physical abnormalities in your baby, although it can't pick up every problem. The anomaly scan is carried out in the same way as the dating scan, with gel on your tummy and the sonographer passing the ultrasound device backwards and forwards over your skin. You will be offered a scan that produces a two-dimensional (2-D) black and white image that gives only a side view of the baby. The NHS screening programme does not use 3-D or colour images. The anomaly scan is offered to everybody, but you do not have to have it if you do not want to. The scan is a medical examination. You will be asked to give your permission for it to be carried out. Make sure you understand what is going to happen, and feel free to ask any questions. What is the scan for? The mid-pregnancy anomaly scan looks for some physical abnormalities in the baby. The scan only looks for these problems and cannot find everything that might be wrong. What kind of problems does the scan look for? The scan looks in detail at the baby's bones, heart, brain, spinal cord, face, kidneys and abdomen. It allows the sonographer to look specifically for 11 conditions, some of which are very rare. For an information leaflet on each of these conditions, including treatment options, click on the links below: anencephaly open spina bifida cleft lip   diaphragmatic hernia  gastrochisis  exomphalos  serious cardiac abnormalities  bilateral renal agenesis lethal skeletal dysplasia  Edwards' syndrome, or T18  Patau's syndrome, or T13   In most cases, the scan will show that the baby appears to be developing normally, but sometimes the sonographer will find or suspect a problem. Some problems can be seen more clearly than others. For example, some babies have a problem called open spina bifida, which affects the spinal cord. Spina bifida can usually be seen clearly on a scan, and will be detected in around 9 out of 10 babies who have this problem. Some other problems, such as heart defects, are more difficult to see. The scan will find about half of those babies who have heart defects. Some of the problems that can be seen on the scan, such as cleft lip, will mean the baby may need treatment or extra surgery after they are born. In a small number of cases, some very serious problems are found \u2013 for example, the baby's brain, kidneys, internal organs or bones may not have developed properly. In some very serious, rare cases where no treatment is possible, the baby will die soon after it is born or may die during pregnancy. What happens at the scan? Most scans are carried out by specially trained staff called sonographers. The scan is carried out in a dimly lit room so the sonographer can get good images of the baby. You will be asked to lie on a couch and to lower your skirt or trousers to your hips and lift your top to your chest so your abdomen is uncovered. The sonographer or their assistant will tuck tissue paper around your clothing to protect it from the gel, which will be put on your tummy. The sonographer then passes a handheld probe over your skin to examine the baby's body. The gel makes sure there is good contact between the probe and your skin. A black and white image of the baby will appear on the ultrasound screen. Having the scan does not hurt, but the sonographer may need to apply slight pressure to get the best views of the baby. This might be uncomfortable. The sonographer needs to keep the screen in a position that gives them a good view of the baby. The screen may be directly facing them, or at an angle. Sometimes the sonographer doing the scan will need to be quiet while they concentrate on checking your baby. However, they will be able to talk to you about the pictures once they've completed the check. The appointment for the mid-pregnancy scan usually takes around 30 minutes. Sometimes it is difficult to get a good picture if the baby is lying in an awkward position, if they are moving around a lot, or if you are above average weight. This does not mean there is anything to worry about. You may need to have a full bladder when you come for the appointment. The doctor or midwife looking after you will let you know before you come. If you are not sure, you can contact them and ask. Can my partner or a friend come to the scan with me? Yes. The mid-pregnancy scan can sometimes find problems with the baby. You may like someone to come with you to the scan appointment. Most hospitals do not allow children to attend scans as childcare is not usually available. Please ask your hospital about this before your appointment. Can the scan harm me or my baby? There are no known risks to the baby or you from having an ultrasound scan, but it is important to think carefully about whether to have the scan or not. The scan may provide information that may mean you have to make some important decisions. For example, you may be offered further tests that have a risk of miscarriage, and you will need to decide whether or not to have these tests.  Do I have to have this scan? No, you do not have to have the scan \u2013 it is your choice whether to have it or not. Some people want to find out if their baby has problems and some do not. If you choose not to have the scan, your antenatal care will continue as normal.  When will I get the results of the scan? The sonographer will be able to tell you the results of the scan at the time. What if the scan shows a possible problem? Most scans show that the baby seems to be developing normally and no problems are found. If any problem is found or suspected, the sonographer may ask for another member of staff to look at the scan and give a second opinion. Scans cannot find all problems, and there is always a chance that a baby may be born with a health problem that scans could not have seen. Will I need any further tests? If the scan shows that there might be a problem, you may be offered another test to find out for certain. If you are offered further tests, you will be given more information about the tests so you can decide whether or not you want to have them. You will be able to discuss this with your midwife or consultant. If necessary, you will be referred to a specialist, possibly in another hospital.

What is the test for Down syndrome? Media last reviewed: 17\/03\/2014 Next review due: 17\/03\/2017 Screening for Down's, Edwards' and Patau's syndromes Pregnant women are offered a screening test for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome from 10-14 weeks of pregnancy. This is to assess your chance of having a baby with these conditions. Down's syndrome is also called Trisomy 21 or T21. Edwards' syndrome is also called Trisomy 18 or T18, and Patau's syndrome is also called Trisomy 13 or T13. The screening test offered at 10-14 weeks is called the combined test. It involves a blood test and an ultrasound scan. All women in England are offered screening for Down\u2019s syndrome using this test. Screening for Patau\u2019s and Edwards\u2019 syndromes using the combined test started in 2015 and will be available across England by April 2016. If you are too far into your pregnancy to have the combined test, you will be offered other tests. For Down\u2019s syndrome, a blood test called the quadruple test is available from weeks 14-20 of pregnancy. For Patau\u2019s and Edwards\u2019 syndromes, you will be offered a mid-pregnancy scan that checks for physical abnormalities. If a screening test shows that you have a higher risk of having a baby with Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes, you will be offered diagnostic tests to find out for certain if your baby has the condition. What are Down's, Edwards' and Patau's syndromes? Inside the cells of our bodies there are tiny structures called chromosomes. Chromosomes carry the genes that determine how we develop. There are 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell. Problems can occur when sperm or egg cells are produced, which can lead to a baby having an extra chromosome.  Read more about chromosomes. Down's syndrome In Down's syndrome, there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 in each cell. A baby born with Down's syndrome will have a learning disability. This means they will find it harder than most people to understand and learn new things. They may have communication problems and difficulty managing some everyday tasks. It is impossible to know what level of learning disability a baby with Down's syndrome will have. It can vary from mild to severe. Most children with Down's syndrome attend mainstream primary school. People with Down's syndrome can have a good quality of life. With support from their family and others, many people are able to get jobs and live fairly independently. Some health problems are more common in people with Down's syndrome, such as heart conditions and problems with the digestive system, hearing and vision. Sometimes these problems can be serious, but many can be treated. With good healthcare, someone with Down's syndrome can live to around 60. People with Down's syndrome have almond-shaped eyes and distinctive facial features, but they do not all look the same. Like all children, they also inherit features from their parents. Read more about Down's syndrome. Edwards' and Patau's syndromes In Edwards' syndrome, there is an extra copy of chromosome 18 in each cell. In Patau's syndrome, there is an extra copy of chromosome 13 in each cell. Sadly, most babies with Edwards' or Patau's syndromes will die before they are born or die shortly after birth. Some babies may survive to adulthood, but this is rare. All babies born with Edwards' or Patau's syndromes will have a wide range of problems, which are usually very serious. These may include major brain abnormalities. Babies affected by Edwards' syndrome can have heart problems, unusual head and facial features, growth problems, and be unable to stand or walk. Edwards' syndrome affects about 3 out of every 10,000 births. Babies affected by Patau's syndrome can have heart problems, a cleft lip and palate, growth problems, poorly formed eyes and ears, problems with their kidneys, and be unable to stand or walk. Patau's syndrome affects about 2 out of every 10,000 births. Read more about Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome. What does screening for Down's, Edwards' and Patau's syndromes involve? A screening test for Down's, Edwards' and Patau's syndromes is available from weeks 10-14 of pregnancy. It is called the combined test because it combines an ultrasound scan with a blood test. The scan can be carried out at the same time as the pregnancy dating scan. If you choose to have the test, a blood sample will be taken from you. At the scan, the fluid at the back of the baby's neck is measured (known as the nuchal translucency). Your age and the information from these two tests is used to work out the risk of the baby having Down's syndrome, or Edwards' or Patau's syndromes. It is not always possible to obtain a nuchal transparency measurement, and depends on the position of the baby. If this is the case, you will be offered a different blood screening test to take place from weeks 14-20.  If you are too far on in your pregnancy (more than 14 weeks) to have the combined test, you will be offered a test called the quadruple blood screening test from 14-20 weeks of pregnancy. This blood test only screens for Down\u2019s syndrome and is not quite as accurate as the combined test. For Edwards' and Patau's syndromes, if you are too far into your pregnancy to have the combined test, you will be offered a mid-pregnancy scan. This scan looks for physical abnormalities and 11 rare conditions, including Edwards\u2019 and Patau\u2019s syndromes. Can this screening test harm me or my baby? The screening test cannot harm you or the baby, but it is important to consider carefully whether to have this test. It cannot tell you for certain if the baby has or does not have Down's, Edward's or Patau's syndromes. The test can provide information that may lead to further important decisions. For example, you may be offered diagnostic tests that can tell you for certain whether the baby has these conditions, but these tests have a risk of miscarriage. Do I need to have screening for Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes? You do not need to have this screening test \u2013 it is your choice whether or not to have it. Some people want to find out the risk of their baby having these conditions, and some do not. You can choose to have screening for: all the conditions (Down's, Edwards' and Patau's syndromes) Down's syndrome only Edwards' and Patau's syndromes only none of the conditions What if I decide not to have this test? If you choose not to have the screening test for Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes, you can still choose to have other tests, such as a dating scan. If you choose not to have the screening test for these conditions, it is important to understand that if you have a scan at any point during your pregnancy, it could pick up physical abnormalities. The person scanning you will always tell you if any abnormalities are found. Getting your results The screening test will not tell you if your baby has or does not have Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes. It will tell you if you have a higher or lower risk of having a baby with one of these conditions. If you have screening for all three syndromes, you will receive one risk for Down's syndrome and one combined risk for Edwards' and Patau's syndromes (two risks altogether). If your screening test shows a lower-risk result, you should be told within two weeks of the test being taken. If your screening test shows a higher-risk result, you should be told within three working days of the blood test result being available. This may take a little longer if your test is sent to another hospital. It may be worth asking the midwife what happens in your area and when you can expect to get your results. You will be offered an appointment to discuss the test results and the options you will have. The charity Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC) offers lots of information about screening results and the options you face if you get a higher-risk result. There is also an ARC forum, where you can be put in touch with people who are in the same situation as you. You can read about people's experiences of deciding to continue a pregnancy on the ARC website. Possible results If the screening test shows that the chance of having a baby with Down's, Edwards' and Patau's syndromes is lower than 1 in 150, this is a lower-risk result. More than 95 out of 100 screening test results (95%) will be lower risk. A lower-risk result does not mean there is no risk at all of the baby having Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes. If the screening test shows that the chance of the baby having Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes is higher than 1 in 150 (that is, between 1 in 2 and 1 in 150), this is called a higher-risk result. Fewer than 1 in 20 test results (5%) will be higher risk. This means that out of 100 women accepting screening for Down's, Edwards' and Patau's syndromes, fewer than 5 will have a higher-risk result. A higher-risk result does not mean the baby definitely has Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes. Will I need further tests? If you have a lower-risk result, you will not be offered a further test. If you have a higher-risk result, you will be offered a diagnostic test, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This will tell you for certain whether the baby has Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndrome or not. About 1 in 100 diagnostic tests (1%) result in a miscarriage. It is up to you whether or not to have the further tests. When trying to decide whether to have a diagnostic test, try to balance up the risk of miscarriage with how important the result will be to you. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) This diagnostic test is usually done from weeks 11-14 of pregnancy. A fine needle, usually put through the mother's abdomen, is used to take a tiny sample of tissue from the placenta. The cells from the tissue are then tested for Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes. Read more about CVS. Amniocentesis Amniocentesis is done from around week 15 of pregnancy. A fine needle is passed through the mother's abdomen into the uterus to collect a small sample of the fluid surrounding the baby. The fluid contains cells from the baby, which are tested for Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes. Read more about amniocentesis. If you find out your unborn baby has Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndrome A small number of women who have a diagnostic test will find out their baby has Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndrome. They then have two options. Some women decide to continue with the pregnancy and prepare for their child with the condition; others decide they do not want to continue with the pregnancy and have a termination (abortion). If you are faced with this choice, you will get support from health professionals to help you make your decision. You can get more information from the charity Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC), which runs a helpline (Mon-Fri) on 0845 077 2290 or 020 7137 7486 from a mobile. The Down's Syndrome Association also has useful information on screening, and the UK National Screening Committee has produced a booklet called Screening tests for you and your baby.

This is part of routine antenatal screening and is offered and recommended for all pregnant women. You will usually be offered the blood test at your booking appointment with a midwife, when you are around 8-12 weeks pregnant. What is the blood test for infectious diseases looking for? You'll be offered this blood test to find out if you: have hepatitis B have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have syphilis If you already know you have HIV or hepatitis B, you will need early specialist appointments to plan your care in pregnancy. Why are these diseases serious in pregnancy? Hepatitis B and HIV are viruses that are passed on in blood and other body fluids through sexual contact or infected needles. Both these viruses and syphilis can be passed from mother to baby. Hepatitis B Hepatitis B affects the liver and can cause acute (immediate) and chronic (long-term) illness. Pregnant women with hepatitis B need specialist care, which you will be offered if the test is positive or if you already know you have hepatitis B. If your baby completes a course of vaccinations in the first year of its life, this greatly reduces their risk of developing hepatitis B. HIV HIV weakens the immune system (the body's way of defending itself against illness), making it difficult to fight off infections. It can eventually lead to AIDS. If untreated, HIV can be passed from a pregnant woman to her baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding. Treatment in pregnancy greatly reduces the risk of passing on HIV to the baby from 1 in 4 (25%) to less than 1 in a 100 (1%). Syphilis Syphilis is passed on through sexual contact. It can also be passed from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby during pregnancy. The earlier it is treated, the less chance there is of passing it onto the baby. The treatment is usually antibiotics. If untreated, syphilis can cause serious health problems for the mother and her baby, or cause miscarriage or stillbirth. How is the test done, and are there any risks? A blood sample is taken from your arm. There are no risks associated with this test, either for you or your baby. Do I need to have this test? It's your choice whether to be tested for all or any of the infections. The tests are recommended to protect your health through early treatment and care, and to reduce any risk of passing an infection on to the baby, your partner or other family members. If you test positive for HIV, syphilis or hepatitis B, your partner  and other family members may be offered a test for the infection.  What if I decide not to have the blood test for any of the infectious diseases? If you decide not to have the test in early pregnancy, you will be offered screening again by a specialist midwife before you are 20 weeks pregnant. The midwife will discuss with you the benefits of screening for these infections for you and your unborn baby. You can ask to have a test for hepatitis B, HIV or syphilis at any time if you change your sexual partner or think you are at risk. How will I get my results? Your midwife will usually discuss your results with you before or at your next antenatal visit and record them in your notes. A specialist midwife will contact you if you have a positive test result for hepatitis B, HIV or syphilis. This is to arrange appointments where you can discuss your results and arrange referral to specialist care services. Results The screening tests will tell you if you have hepatitis B, HIV or syphilis. You will need further tests and examinations by the specialist care team to fully assess your condition and what treatment and care you will need. Hepatitis B If you have hepatitis B, you will receive specialist care throughout your pregnancy and after the baby is born. Your partner and any other children may need testing and vaccination. To prevent the baby getting hepatitis, he or she will need four vaccinations at the following times: within 24 hours of birth at four weeks at eight weeks at one year of age, with a blood test to check if infection has been avoided It is very important that the baby has all four doses of the vaccine to protect their health. Your partner and any other children you have should also be offered a test and a vaccination, if needed. HIV If you have HIV, you can greatly reduce the risk of passing HIV on to the baby through specialist care and treatment, medication, planned care for your birth, and by not breastfeeding. Your partner and any other children you have should also be offered a test to see if they need treatment as well. Syphilis If you have syphilis, you will need urgent referral to a specialist care team. Treatment is usually a course of antibiotics. Your care team will also offer to test your partner to see if they need treatment as well. The baby may need to be examined and given antibiotics after birth. After your results Be aware that you can still get all of these infections during pregnancy even after you've had a negative test result. You can catch sexually transmitted infections during pregnancy if you or your sexual partner take risks, such as having unprotected sex. You can also get HIV and hepatitis if you inject illegal drugs and share needles. Remember, you can request testing for hepatitis B, HIV or syphilis at any time if you think you are at risk or change sexual partner. Screening for rubella Screening for rubella in pregnancy is not being offered to women in England who start their antenatal care after April 1 2016. This is because rubella is now very rare in the UK, due to the high uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The best way to protect you and your baby from rubella is to ensure you have had two MMR vaccinations. This will protect you and your baby in any future pregnancy and give you longer-term protection against measles, mumps and rubella. You can\u2019t have MMR vaccinations while you\u2019re pregnant and you should avoid becoming pregnant for one month after MMR vaccination. If you are currently pregnant and you're not sure whether you\u2019ve had two doses of the MMR vaccination, ask your GP practice to check your vaccination history.  If the records show you haven\u2019t been fully vaccinated or there is no record, you should ask for the vaccination at your six-week postnatal check after your baby is born. If you have a rash in pregnancy, tell your GP or midwife immediately You should let your midwife, GP or obstetrician know straight away if you have a rash or come into contact with someone who has a rash at any time during your pregnancy. They can arrange tests, if need be, to check if you have rubella. You should avoid any clinic or maternity setting until you have been assessed, avoiding contact with other pregnant women. If you started your antenatal care before April 1 2016 You will still be offered the blood test to check if you are immune to rubella. You will be given your results at your 16-week antenatal appointment. If you are not immune, you will be offered an MMR vaccination after the birth of your baby and advised to see your GP for your second vaccination at your six-week postnatal check.

If you are a carrier of sickle cell or thalassaemia, you can pass these conditions on to your baby. All pregnant women in England are offered a blood test to find out if they carry a gene for thalassaemia, and those at high risk of being a sickle cell carrier are also offered a test for sickle cell. If the mother is found to be a carrier, screening is also offered to the father.  This test should be offered before you're 10 weeks pregnant. It's important the test is done early \u2013 if you find out you're a carrier, you and your partner will have the option of further tests to know if your baby will be affected. This page covers: Why will I be offered screening in pregnancy? What does the screening test involve? Do I have to have this screening test? Getting your screening results Further tests in pregnancy if the mother's a carrier If your unborn baby has sickle cell disease or thalassaemia major What if I decide not to have screening when I'm pregnant? Can anyone have a test for sickle cell and thalassaemia? Finding out you're a carrier What if I get pregnant and already know I'm a carrier or my partner is a carrier? About sickle cell and thalassaemia Sickle cell disease and thalassaemia major affect haemoglobin, a part of the blood that carries oxygen around the body. People who have these conditions will need specialist care throughout their lives. People with sickle cell: can have episodes of very severe pain can get serious, life-threatening infections are usually anaemic \u2013 their bodies have difficulty carrying oxygen Babies with sickle cell disease can receive early treatment, including immunisations and antibiotics. This, along with support from their parents, will help prevent serious illness and allow the child to live a healthier life. Find out more about sickle cell disease. People with thalassaemia major are very anaemic and need a blood transfusion every three to five weeks, as well as injections and medicines throughout their lives. Read more about thalassaemia. There are also other less common, and less serious, haemoglobin disorders that may be found through screening. Why will I be offered screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia early in pregnancy? Screening is offered to find out if you are a carrier of a gene for sickle cell or thalassaemia and therefore likely to pass it on to your baby. Genes are the codes in our bodies for things like eye colour and blood group. Genes work in pairs: for everything we inherit, we get one gene from our mother and one gene from our father. People only have sickle cell disease or thalassaemia major if they inherit two unusual haemoglobin genes \u2013 one from their mother and one from their father. People who inherit just one unusual gene are known as \"carriers\", or as having a \"trait\". Carriers are healthy and do not have the disease. Sickle cell carriers can experience some problems in situations where their bodies might not get enough oxygen, such as having a general anaesthetic. All carriers can pass the unusual gene on to their children. When both parents are carriers When both parents are carriers, each time they are expecting a child there is: a one in four (25%) chance of the child not being affected \u2013 the baby will not have or carry the disease a one in four (25%) chance of inheriting both unusual haemoglobin genes and having the disease a two in four (50%) chance of inheriting one unusual haemoglobin gene and being a carrier Anyone can be a carrier of haemoglobin disease. However, it is more common among people with ancestors from Africa, the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, India, Pakistan, south and southeast Asia, and the Middle East. Read more about being a carrier of sickle cell disease or a carrier of thalassaemia. What does the screening test involve? Screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia involves a blood test. It's best to have the test before you are 10 weeks pregnant. This is because you'll have the option of more tests to find out whether your baby will be affected if this first test shows you're a carrier of a blood disorder. By having the test early, you and your partner can find out about all your options and make an informed decision if your baby is at risk of inheriting a blood disorder \u2013 see Further tests if the mother is a carrier.  All pregnant women are offered a test for thalassaemia, but not all women are automatically offered a test for sickle cell. In areas where haemoglobin diseases are more common, all women will automatically be offered a blood test for sickle cell. In areas where haemoglobin diseases are less common, a questionnaire is used to identify your family origins and the origins of the baby's father. If the questionnaire shows that either you or the baby's father is at risk of being a sickle cell carrier, you will be offered a screening test. You can ask to have the test even if your family origins do not suggest the baby would be at high risk of a haemoglobin disease. Can this screening harm me or my baby? No, the screening test cannot harm you or your baby, but it is important to think carefully about whether or not to have this test. It can provide information that may mean you have to make further important decisions. For example, you may be offered further tests that have a risk of miscarriage. Do I have to have this screening test? No, you do not have to have the screening test. Some people want to find out if their baby has sickle cell disease or thalassaemia, while others do not. Getting your screening results The test will tell you if you are a carrier or not, or whether you have the disease yourself. You will get the result of the blood test within two weeks. The person doing the test will discuss the arrangements for getting your results to you. If you are found to be a carrier of sickle cell or thalassaemia, you will be contacted by a specialist nurse or midwife counsellor for genetic counselling. Further tests in pregnancy if the mother is a carrier Testing to see if the father is a carrier If the screening test finds that you are a carrier of a haemoglobin disease, your baby's father will also be offered a blood test. If tests show the father is not a carrier, your baby will not have sickle cell disease or thalassaemia major and you will not be offered further tests in pregnancy. However, there is still a 50% chance your baby could be a carrier and pass on the unusual gene to their children. You can discuss the implications of you or your baby being a carrier with your GP or a healthcare professional at your local sickle cell and thalassaemia centre. Read more about finding out you're a carrier. Diagnostic tests when both parents are carriers If tests show your baby's father is also a carrier, there is a one in four chance (25%) that your baby can have the disease. You will be offered further tests called diagnostic tests to find out if your baby is affected. A diagnostic test will tell you: if your baby has sickle cell disease, thalassaemia major or another haemoglobin disorder if your baby is carrier if your baby is completely unaffected If the baby's father is not available and you have been identified as a carrier, you will be offered a diagnostic test. About 1 in 100 diagnostic tests result in a miscarriage. It is up to you whether or not to have the diagnostic test. It can be a very difficult time if you are told you are at risk of having a baby with sickle cell disease or thalassaemia major. You can talk to your midwife, specialist nurse or doctor about your situation and your options. You can also get information and support from the charity Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC). They have a helpline you can call for information and support on 0845 077 2290, or 020 7713 7486 from a mobile. There are two types of diagnostic test: chorionic villus sampling (CVS) \u2013 this is usually performed from 11 to 14 weeks of pregnancy. A fine needle, usually put through the mother's abdomen, is used to take a tiny sample of tissue from the placenta. The cells from the tissue can be tested for sickle cell or thalassaemia. Read more about CVS. amniocentesis \u2013 this is done from 15 weeks of pregnancy. A fine needle is passed through the mother's abdomen into the uterus to collect a small sample of the fluid surrounding the baby. The fluid contains some of the baby's cells, which can be tested for sickle cell or thalassaemia. Read more about amniocentesis. If you find out your unborn baby has sickle cell disease or thalassaemia major If the result shows your baby has sickle cell disease or thalassaemia major, you will be offered an appointment with a health professional. You will be able to get information about the condition the baby has inherited and talk through your choices. Some conditions are more serious than others. Some women decide to continue with the pregnancy, while others decide they do not want to continue with the pregnancy and have a termination (abortion). If you are faced with this choice, you will get professional support to help you make a decision. Support for parents is also available from the charity ARC. If the test shows you are a carrier, there is a chance that other members of your family could be carriers, too. You may want to encourage them to ask for a test, especially if they are planning to have a baby. Find out more about what to expect when a screening test suggests there might be a problem. What if I decide not to have screening when I'm pregnant? If you choose not to have the screening test, your baby can still have screening for sickle cell disease as part of newborn blood spot screening a few days after the birth. Can anyone have a test for sickle cell and thalassaemia at any time? Although testing for sickle cell and thalassaemia is only offered during pregnancy, anyone can ask their GP or local sickle cell and thalassaemia centre for a free test at any time. If you or your partner are concerned you may be a carrier, perhaps because someone in your family has a blood disorder or is a carrier, it's a good idea to get tested before you start a family. That way you can understand your risk of passing on a blood disorder to any children you have, and discuss options for a healthy pregnancy with your GP or another healthcare professional.  Finding out you're a carrier If the test shows you are a carrier of sickle cell, thalassaemia or another haemoglobin variant, you will be contacted by a specialist nurse or midwife counsellor for genetic counselling. You will get a specific carrier result depending on the unusual haemoglobin gene you have inherited. You can find more detailed information about different types of carrier  in these leaflets: Sickle cell carrier Beta thalassaemia carrier Delta beta thalassaemia carrier Haemoglobin O Arab carrier Haemoglobin C carrier Haemoglobin D carrier Haemoglobin E carrier Haemoglobin Lepore carrier There is a chance that other members of your family could be carriers, too. You may want to encourage them to ask for a test, especially if they're planning to have a baby. They can ask their GP or local sickle cell and thalassaemia centre for a free test at any time.   What if I get pregnant and already know I'm a carrier or my partner is a carrier? If one parent is a carrier If you know that either your or your partner is a carrier of sickle cell or thalassaemia, the other parent should get tested as soon as possible if you want to understand your child's risk of inheriting one of these blood disorders, so you can find out about all your options. If both parents are carriers If you're pregnant and already know that both you and your partner are carriers \u2013 for example, because you found out in a previous pregnancy \u2013 you should talk to your GP or midwife as soon as possible. You will then have the option of being fast-tracked for a diagnostic test to find out if your baby's affected. Read more about being a carrier of sickle cell disease or a carrier of thalassaemia.

Outbreaks of typhus tend to occur in developing countries and areas where there is poverty, homelessness, close human contact and poor sanitation. The Rickettsia bacteria that cause typhus are carried by body lice, ticks, mites and fleas. This page covers the main types: epidemic typhus (the most serious form) \u2013 this type occurs in Africa, South America and Asia, and is transmitted by body lice  endemic typhus (the milder form of the disease) \u2013 it occurs throughout the world and is transmitted by ticks, mites and fleas  scrub typhus (also called Tsutsugamushi fever) \u2013 this type is caught from mites infected with Orientia tsutsugamushi bacteria, which live in heavy scrub vegetation in parts of rural southeast Asia, Oceania and northern Australia Typhus is generally not a problem in the UK. But you may become infected abroad if you catch Rickettsia-infected lice from infested people or bedding (in budget accommodation or on a sleeper train, for example), or if you are bitten by a Rickettsia-infected tick, mite or flea. How do you catch epidemic typhus? Epidemic typhus is passed from human to human by body lice. These are not the same as head lice or pubic lice, which are a nuisance, but don't transmit disease. The body lice become infected with Rickettsia prowazekii bacteria when they feed on the blood of an infected person. If you catch these infected body lice (for example, by using a louse-infested blanket), their infected faeces will be deposited on your skin as they feed on your blood. You only need to scratch a bite to rub the contaminated lice faeces into the tiny wound on your skin to become infected. Less commonly, you can catch epidemic typhus by breathing infected dried body louse faeces in airborne dust. How do you catch endemic typhus? Endemic typhus is transmitted by ticks, mites and fleas infected with Rickettsia bacteria. These animal carriers of typhus may live in thick scrub vegetation or on small mammals or rodents, such as rats. What are the symptoms? The symptoms of epidemic, endemic and scrub typhus are similar. Typically, someone with typhus will start to feel unwell 10 to 14 days after becoming infected. A sudden, severe headache is often the first symptom. Other symptoms may include: a fever \u2013 where body temperature rises above 38.9C\/102F for up to two weeks a pink or red rash that starts on the chest and spreads to the arms, hands, legs and feet \u2013 but not the face, palms and soles nausea and vomiting abdominal pain and diarrhoea joint and muscle pain \u2013 backache is common a cough In addition, the person with typhus is often mentally dazed or delirious \u2013 the word \"typhus\" comes from the Greek word meaning \"a cloud\". They may become deaf or have ringing in the ears (tinnitus). These symptoms usually last around two weeks. How is typhus diagnosed and treated? Anyone who is unwell shortly after visiting a high-risk country should see their GP, who will listen to your symptoms and take note of the countries you have recently visited. You will also be physically examined and have a number of tests \u2013 for example, a blood test to rule out other diseases such as malaria. If there is a rash, the GP may take a skin biopsy (a small sample of skin from the rash) and send this to a laboratory for testing. A diagnosis of typhus is confirmed if the Rickettsia bacteria are identified in a blood or skin sample. But the patient may be started on antibiotics even before the results come back if typhus is suspected. If treated promptly with either doxycycline or tetracycline, most patients improve dramatically within 48 hours of treatment and make a full recovery. If the patient has epidemic typhus (the more serious type), they may need to take antibiotics through a drip in their arm (intravenously) while they are in hospital. What are the possible complications? If typhus is not diagnosed and treated promptly, there is a risk of developing complications, including: long-term hearing loss or tinnitus low blood pressure organ damage and kidney failure secondary bacterial infection, such as pneumonia seizures confusion drowsiness gangrene The patient may need to have hospital follow-up for some months after recovering from an attack of typhus to receive treatment for these long-term problems. Brill-Zinsser disease Some people who previously had epidemic typhus will develop a milder form of the disease years later called Brill-Zinsser disease. This tends to happen when the bacteria were not properly killed off the first time and lie dormant (inactive) in the body. The bacteria then reactivate at a later date when the person's immune system is weak. Brill-Zinsser disease will need treating again with antibiotics. Can typhus be prevented? There's currently no licensed vaccine for typhus. The best way to avoid becoming infected with typhus is to avoid areas or crowds where louse-borne typhus is a problem, and take care to avoid contact with ticks, mites and fleas. Wash and change your clothes regularly, and don't use any bedding or clothing that could be infested with body lice. If you're about to travel abroad to an area where typhus is a problem, talk to your doctor about taking weekly doses of doxycycline to prevent infection. This is especially effective against scrub typhus.

Vitamin C Vitamin C (also called ascorbic acid) is vital for the body, because it's needed to make collagen. Collagen is a type of protein found in many different types of tissue, such as skin, blood vessels, bones and cartilage. Without vitamin C, collagen can't be replaced and the different types of tissue break down, leading to the symptoms of scurvy. These include: muscle and joint pain tiredness the appearance of red dots on the skin bleeding and swelling of the gums Read more about the symptoms of scurvy. Unlike some other types of vitamins, the human body is unable to make vitamin C. All of the vitamin C that the body needs has to come from your diet, so the best way to prevent scurvy is to eat a healthy, balanced diet that contains plenty of fruit and vegetables. Read more about preventing scurvy. Who's affected by scurvy? People tend to think that scurvy is a condition of the past, because our diet and standard of living has improved over the years. However, although rare, vitamin C deficiency can still be a problem for certain groups of people, including: elderly people who are unable to maintain a healthy diet people who smoke or have a dependency on alcohol or drugs people on a low income Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may also be at risk of getting scurvy if they will only eat certain foods that aren\u2019t good sources of vitamin C. Read more about the causes of scurvy. Treating scurvy A doctor will usually be able to diagnose scurvy by asking about your symptoms and diet. They may also carry out a blood test to measure the level of vitamin C in your blood. Treatment for scurvy is relatively straightforward. It involves taking vitamin C supplements and eating food that's high in vitamin C. This should quickly reverse the harmful symptoms of scurvy. The fact that a person has scurvy in the first place is usually a sign that they're vulnerable or living a chaotic lifestyle. Referral to a dietitian, social worker or mental healthcare professional may be required to prevent further episodes of scurvy or other problems linked to malnutrition.

But if serious symptoms develop, such as severe pain, swelling or difficulty breathing, dial 999 for an ambulance. Fortunately, there are only a few stinging sea creatures in the seas around the UK. These are: weever fish stingrays sea urchins jellyfish Portuguese man-of-war These are described below. Weever fish Weever fish are small, sandy-coloured fish that usually lie buried in the sand on the seabed. They have poisonous spines on their back and gills that can sting you, usually on your feet or hands. Stingrays Stingrays are flat, circular or diamond-shaped fish that have a sharp, serrated barb underneath their tail. As with weever fish, most people stung by a stingray are stung on their lower legs, ankles and feet after accidentally stepping on one in shallow water. Sea urchins Sea urchins are small, round sea creatures with a bony shell covered in spines. They're usually found in the shallows, on rocks and in seaweed. Sea urchin spines are hard, sharp and can cause puncture wounds. Between the spines are small organs, containing a poison that's released as a defence mechanism. Jellyfish Jellyfish are mushroom-shaped creatures that often float near the surface and have long, thin tentacles on the underside of their bodies. The tentacles are covered with small poisonous sacs called nematocysts which, if touched, produce a nasty sting. During the warmer months in recent years, large groups of jellyfish have become increasingly common in the seas around Europe. Portuguese man-of-war A Portuguese man-of-war is a large, poisonous jellyfish-like creature (although it's not a jellyfish) with a large purple-blue, gas-filled bladder and tentacles that hang below the water. They're usually found in tropical waters, but some have been spotted in UK waters or found washed up on beaches. The sting can be painful, but rarely causes death. Signs and symptoms All stings are painful and cause swelling, inflammation or raised areas of skin (welts) and nausea. You may also have other symptoms, depending on what has stung you. Weever fish and sea urchins usually sting your foot and often leave spines in the wound. Stingrays can leave a large, jagged cut or puncture wound on your skin. Jellyfish and Portuguese men-of-war often leave raised blisters on the skin in the shape of their own tentacles. Read more about the symptoms of sea creature stings. When to seek medical help Seek medical assistance if you've been stung while in the sea and your symptoms are severe \u2013 for example: severe, prolonged pain chest pain or breathing problems severe redness and swelling around the affected area fits or seizures You should also seek medical help if you know you've been stung by a stingray, or if you've been stung on a particularly sensitive part of your body, such as your face or genitals. Less severe marine creature stings can be treated yourself using first aid techniques. Read more about how marine creature stings are treated, both at home and in hospital. Avoiding stings in the sea It's rare to be stung in the seas around the UK, but there are precautions you can take to avoid being stung, including: observing beach warning signs  not touching or handling sea creatures that sting wearing protective clothing, such as a wetsuit or waterproof footwear scuffing your feet as you walk in shallow water to warn any sea creatures that you're approaching Read more about how to prevent being stung in the sea. Healthcare abroad If you're planning a trip abroad, it's a good idea to familiarise yourself with any potentially harmful plants and animals in the countries you'll be visiting. It's also important to have the right travel insurance for the country or countries you visit. Make sure your insurance policy covers specific activities you plan to do, such as water sports or scuba diving. When travelling in Europe, a valid European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) entitles you to free or reduced-cost medical care. However, the EHIC isn't a substitute for travel insurance and doesn't provide the same level of cover \u2013 for example, an EHIC doesn't cover emergency travel back to the UK.

SAD is sometimes known as \"winter depression\" because the symptoms are more apparent and tend to be more severe during the winter. The symptoms often begin in the autumn as the days start getting shorter. They're typically most severe during December, January and February. SAD often improves and disappears in the spring and summer, although it may return each autumn and winter in a repetitive pattern. Symptoms of SAD Symptoms of SAD can include: a persistent low mood a loss of pleasure or interest in normal everyday activities irritability feelings of despair, guilt and worthlessness feeling lethargic (lacking in energy) and sleepy during the day sleeping for longer than normal and finding it hard to get up in the morning craving carbohydrates and gaining weight For some people, these symptoms can be severe and have a significant impact on their day-to-day activities. Read more about the symptoms of SAD.  When to see your GP You should consider seeing your GP if you think you might have SAD and you're struggling to cope. Your GP can carry out an assessment to check your mental health. They may ask you about your mood, lifestyle, eating habits and sleeping patterns, plus any seasonal changes in your thoughts and behaviour. Read more about diagnosing SAD. What causes SAD? The exact cause of SAD isn't fully understood, but it's often linked to reduced exposure to sunlight during the shorter autumn and winter days. The main theory is that a lack of sunlight might stop a part of the brain called the hypothalamus working properly, which may affect the: production of melatonin \u2013 melatonin is a hormone that makes you feel sleepy; in people with SAD, the body may produce it in higher than normal levels production of serotonin \u2013 serotonin is a hormone that affects your mood, appetite and sleep; a lack of sunlight may lead to lower serotonin levels, which is linked to feelings of depression body's internal clock (circadian rhythm) \u2013 your body uses sunlight to time various important functions, such as when you wake up, so lower light levels during the winter may disrupt your body clock and lead to symptoms of SAD It's also possible that some people are more vulnerable to SAD as a result of their genes, as some cases appear to run in families.

Symptoms of hay fever include: sneezing a runny nose itchy eyes You'll experience hay fever symptoms if you have an allergic reaction to pollen. Pollen is a fine powder released by plants as part of their reproductive cycle. It contains proteins that can cause the nose, eyes, throat and sinuses (small air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead) to become swollen, irritated and inflamed. You can have an allergy to: tree pollen, released during spring grass pollen, released during the end of spring and beginning of summer weed pollen, released late autumn Read more about the causes of hay fever. Many people find their symptoms improve as they get older. Around half of people report some improvement in symptoms after several years. Symptoms disappear completely in around 10-20% of people. Hay fever treatment There's currently no cure for hay fever, but most people are able to relieve symptoms with treatment, at least to a certain extent. The most effective way to control hay fever would be to avoid exposure to pollen. However, it's very difficult to avoid pollen, particularly during the summer months when you want to spend more time outdoors. Treatment options for hay fever include antihistamines, which can help to prevent an allergic reaction from occurring and corticosteroids (steroids), which help to reduce inflammation and swelling. Hay fever can often be controlled using over-the-counter medication from your pharmacist. However, if your symptoms are more troublesome it\u2019s worth speaking to your GP, as you may require prescription medication. For severe and persistent hay fever, there's also a type of treatment called immunotherapy. It involves being exposed to small amounts of pollen over time, to build resistance to its allergic effects. However, this can take many months or even years to work. Read more about treating hay fever. Who's affected Hay fever is one of the most common allergic conditions. It's estimated that there are more than 10 million people with hay fever in England. You can get hay fever at any age, although it usually begins in childhood or during the teenage years. It's more common in boys than girls. In adults, men and women are equally affected. You're more likely to develop hay fever if you have a family history of allergies, particularly asthma or eczema. Self-help tips It's sometimes possible to prevent the symptoms of hay fever by taking some basic precautions, such as: wearing wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting in your eyes when you're outdoors taking a shower and changing your clothes after being outdoors to remove the pollen on your body staying indoors when the pollen count is high (over 50 grains per cubic metre of air) applying a small amount of Vaseline (petroleum gel) to the nasal openings to trap pollen grains Read more about preventing hay fever. Complications Even though hay fever doesn't pose a serious threat to health, it can have a negative impact on a person's quality of life. People with very severe hay fever often find that it can disrupt their productivity at school or work. Inflammation of the sinuses (sinusitis) is another common complication of hay fever. Children may also develop a middle ear infection (otitis media) as a result of hay fever. Read more about the complications of hay fever.   Allergic rhinitis Seasonal allergic rhinitis is the medical term for hay fever. Rhinitis means inflammation of the inside of the nose. Some people also experience hay fever-like symptoms when exposed to other allergy-triggering substances, such as dust mites and animal fur. Read more about other types of allergic rhinitis. Pollen count The pollen count is a measurement of the amount of pollen in the air. The higher the count, the more severe symptoms of hay fever can become (depending on the specific type of pollen you're allergic to). The Met Office provides a pollen forecast. If the pollen count is high, you can take preventative measures, such as taking antihistamine medication, before leaving the house.

It can be very unpleasant, but you'll usually begin to feel better within about a week. You can catch flu \u2013 short for influenza \u2013 all year round, but it's especially common in winter, which is why it's also known as \"seasonal flu\". It's not the same as the common cold. Flu is caused by a different group of viruses and the symptoms tend to start more suddenly, be more severe and last longer. Some of the main symptoms of flu include: a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above tiredness and weakness a headache general aches and pains a dry, chesty cough Cold-like symptoms \u2013 such as a blocked or runny nose, sneezing, and a sore throat \u2013 can also be caused by flu, but they tend to be less severe than the other symptoms you have. Flu can make you feel so exhausted and unwell that you have to stay in bed and rest until you feel better. Read more about the symptoms of flu. What to do If you're otherwise fit and healthy, there's usually no need to see a doctor if you have flu-like symptoms. The best remedy is to rest at home, keep warm and drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. You can take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower a high temperature and relieve aches if necessary. Stay off work or school until you're feeling better. For most people, this will take about a week. Read more about treating flu at home. When to see your GP Consider visiting your GP if: you're 65 years of age or over you're pregnant you have a long-term medical condition \u2013 such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease or a neurological disease you have a weakened immune system \u2013 for example, because you're having chemotherapy or have HIV you develop chest pain, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or start coughing up blood your symptoms are getting worse over time or haven't improved after a week In these situations, you may need medication to treat or prevent complications of flu. Your doctor may recommend taking antiviral medicine to reduce your symptoms and help you recover more quickly. Read more about antiviral medication for flu. How long does flu last and is it serious? If you have flu, you generally start to feel ill within a few days of being infected. You should begin to feel much better within a week or so, although you may feel tired for much longer. You will usually be most infectious from the day your symptoms start and for a further three to seven days. Children and people with weaker immune systems may remain infectious for longer. Most people will make a full recovery and won't experience any further problems, but elderly people and people with certain long-term medical conditions are more likely to have a bad case of flu or develop a serious complication, such as a chest infection. Read more about the complications of flu. How you catch flu The flu virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when someone who is infected coughs or sneezes. These droplets typically spread about one metre. They hang suspended in the air for a while before landing on surfaces, where the virus can survive for up to 24 hours. Anyone who breathes in the droplets can catch flu. You can also catch the virus by touching the surfaces that the droplets have landed on if you pick up the virus on your hands and then touch your nose or mouth. Everyday items at home and in public places can easily become contaminated with the flu virus, including food, door handles, remote controls, handrails, telephone handsets and computer keyboards. Therefore, it's important to wash your hands frequently. You can catch flu many times, because flu viruses change regularly and your body won't have natural resistance to the new versions. Preventing the spread of flu You can help stop yourself catching flu or spreading it to others with good hygiene measures. Always wash your hands regularly with soap and warm water, as well as: regularly cleaning surfaces such as your computer keyboard, telephone and door handles to get rid of germs using tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze putting used tissues in a bin as soon as possible You can also help stop the spread of flu by avoiding unnecessary contact with other people while you're infectious. You should stay off work or school until you're feeling better. In some people at risk of more serious flu, an annual flu vaccine (see below) or antiviral medication may be recommended to help reduce the risk of becoming infected. Read more about how to stop the spread of flu. The flu vaccine A flu vaccine is available for free on the NHS for: anyone over the age of 65  pregnant women anyone who is very overweight (with a body mass index over 40) children and adults with an underlying health condition (particularly long-term heart or lung disease) children and adults with weakened immune systems An annual flu vaccine nasal spray is also now offered to healthy children aged two, three and four years old, and to children in school years one and two.  The best time to have the vaccine is in the autumn, between September and early November. If you think you might need it, contact your local GP surgery. You should have the flu vaccination every year so you stay protected, as the viruses that cause flu change every year. For more information on who should have the flu vaccine and how to get it, read the sections on the flu jab for adults, the flu jab for pregnant women and the children's flu vaccine. Other types of flu As well as seasonal flu, there are several other types of flu. These include: bird (avian) flu \u2013 a type of flu spread among birds that affects humans in rare cases swine flu \u2013 the type of flu that was responsible for the flu pandemic in 2009-10 \"gastric flu\" (gastroenteritis) \u2013 an infection of the digestive system, which can be caused by bacteria or viruses such as the norovirus Click on the links above for more information about these types of flu.

Flu can be unpleasant, but if you are otherwise healthy it will usually clear up on its own within a week. However, flu can be more severe in certain people, such as: anyone aged 65 and over pregnant women children and adults with an underlying health condition (particularly long-term heart or respiratory disease) children and adults with weakened immune systems Anyone in these risk groups is more likely to develop potentially serious complications of flu, such as pneumonia (a lung infection), so it's recommended that they have a flu vaccine every year to protect them.  The injected flu vaccine is offered free on the NHS annually to: adults over the age of 18 at risk of flu (including everyone aged 65 and over) pregnant women  children aged six months to two years at risk of flu Find out more about who should have the flu jab. Flu nasal spray vaccination The flu vaccine is routinely given on the NHS as an annual nasal spray to: children aged two, three and four years old plus children in school years one, two and three.  children aged two to 17 years at a particular risk of flu Read more about the flu nasal spray for children. 65 and overs and the flu jab You are eligible for the flu vaccine this year (2016-17) if you will be aged 65 and over on March 31 2017 \u2013 that is, you were born on or before March 31 1952. So, if you are currently 64 but will be 65 on March 31 2017, you do qualify. Where to get the flu jab You can have your NHS flu jab at: your GP surgery a local pharmacy offering the service your midwifery service if they offer it for pregnant women Some community pharmacies now offer flu vaccination to adults (but not children) at risk of flu including pregnant women, people aged 65 and over, people with long-term health conditions and carers. If you have your flu jab at a pharmacy, you don't have to inform your GP \u2013 it is up to the pharmacist to do that. How effective is the flu jab? Flu vaccine is the best protection we have against an unpredictable virus that can cause unpleasant illness in children and severe illness and death among at-risk groups, including older people, pregnant women and those with an underlying medical health condition. Studies have shown that the flu jab does work and will help prevent you getting the flu. It won't stop all flu viruses and the level of protection may vary between people, so it's not a 100% guarantee that you'll be flu-free, but if you do get flu after vaccination it's likely to be milder and shorter-lived than it would otherwise have been. There is also evidence to suggest that the flu jab can reduce your risk of having a stroke. Over time, protection from the injected flu vaccine gradually decreases and flu strains often change. So new flu vaccines are produced each year which is why people advised to have the flu jab need it every year too. Read more about how the flu jab works. Flu jab side effects Serious side effects of the injected flu vaccine are very rare. You may have a slight temperature and aching muscles for a couple of days after having the jab, and your arm may be a bit sore where you were injected. Read more about the side effects of the flu jab. When to have a flu jab The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn, from the beginning of October to early November, but don't worry if you've missed it, you can have the vaccine later in winter. Ask your GP or pharmacist. The flu jab for 2016\/17 Each year, the viruses that are most likely to cause flu are identified in advance and vaccines are made to match them as closely as possible. The vaccines are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Most injected flu vaccines protect against three types of flu virus: A\/H1N1 \u2013 the strain of flu that caused the swine flu pandemic in 2009 A\/H3N2 \u2013 a strain of flu that mainly affects the elderly and people with risk factors like a long term health condition. In 2016\/17 the vaccine will contain an A\/Hong Kong\/4801\/2014 H3N2-like virus Influenza B - a strain of flu that particularly affects children. In 2016\/17 the vaccine will contain B\/Brisbane\/60\/2008-like virus The nasal spray flu vaccine and some injected vaccines also offer protection against a fourth B strain of virus, which in 2016\/17 is the B\/Phuket\/3073\/2013-like virus.

Flu can be unpleasant, but if you are otherwise healthy it will usually clear up on its own within a week. However, flu can be more severe in certain people, such as: anyone aged 65 and over pregnant women children and adults with an underlying health condition (particularly long-term heart or respiratory disease) children and adults with weakened immune systems Anyone in these risk groups is more likely to develop potentially serious complications of flu, such as pneumonia (a lung infection), so it's recommended that they have a flu vaccine every year to protect them.  The injected flu vaccine is offered free on the NHS annually to: adults over the age of 18 at risk of flu (including everyone aged 65 and over) pregnant women  children aged six months to two years at risk of flu Find out more about who should have the flu jab. Flu nasal spray vaccination The flu vaccine is routinely given on the NHS as an annual nasal spray to: children aged two, three and four years old plus children in school years one, two and three.  children aged two to 17 years at a particular risk of flu Read more about the flu nasal spray for children. 65 and overs and the flu jab You are eligible for the flu vaccine this year (2016-17) if you will be aged 65 and over on March 31 2017 \u2013 that is, you were born on or before March 31 1952. So, if you are currently 64 but will be 65 on March 31 2017, you do qualify. Where to get the flu jab You can have your NHS flu jab at: your GP surgery a local pharmacy offering the service your midwifery service if they offer it for pregnant women Some community pharmacies now offer flu vaccination to adults (but not children) at risk of flu including pregnant women, people aged 65 and over, people with long-term health conditions and carers. If you have your flu jab at a pharmacy, you don't have to inform your GP \u2013 it is up to the pharmacist to do that. How effective is the flu jab? Flu vaccine is the best protection we have against an unpredictable virus that can cause unpleasant illness in children and severe illness and death among at-risk groups, including older people, pregnant women and those with an underlying medical health condition. Studies have shown that the flu jab does work and will help prevent you getting the flu. It won't stop all flu viruses and the level of protection may vary between people, so it's not a 100% guarantee that you'll be flu-free, but if you do get flu after vaccination it's likely to be milder and shorter-lived than it would otherwise have been. There is also evidence to suggest that the flu jab can reduce your risk of having a stroke. Over time, protection from the injected flu vaccine gradually decreases and flu strains often change. So new flu vaccines are produced each year which is why people advised to have the flu jab need it every year too. Read more about how the flu jab works. Flu jab side effects Serious side effects of the injected flu vaccine are very rare. You may have a slight temperature and aching muscles for a couple of days after having the jab, and your arm may be a bit sore where you were injected. Read more about the side effects of the flu jab. When to have a flu jab The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn, from the beginning of October to early November, but don't worry if you've missed it, you can have the vaccine later in winter. Ask your GP or pharmacist. The flu jab for 2016\/17 Each year, the viruses that are most likely to cause flu are identified in advance and vaccines are made to match them as closely as possible. The vaccines are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Most injected flu vaccines protect against three types of flu virus: A\/H1N1 \u2013 the strain of flu that caused the swine flu pandemic in 2009 A\/H3N2 \u2013 a strain of flu that mainly affects the elderly and people with risk factors like a long term health condition. In 2016\/17 the vaccine will contain an A\/Hong Kong\/4801\/2014 H3N2-like virus Influenza B - a strain of flu that particularly affects children. In 2016\/17 the vaccine will contain B\/Brisbane\/60\/2008-like virus The nasal spray flu vaccine and some injected vaccines also offer protection against a fourth B strain of virus, which in 2016\/17 is the B\/Phuket\/3073\/2013-like virus. Is there anyone who shouldn't have the flu jab? Most adults can have the injected flu vaccine, but you should avoid it if you have had a serious allergic reaction to a flu jab in the past. Read more about who shouldn't have the flu vaccine. You can find out more by reading the answers to the most common questions that people have about the flu vaccine.

However, they're able to speak freely to close family and friends when nobody else is listening \u2013 for example, when they're at home.  It's important to understand that when the mutism happens, the child is not voluntarily refusing to speak but is literally unable to speak, feeling frozen. In time, they learn to anticipate the situations that provoke mutism and do all they can to avoid them. Experts believe SM is a phobia of talking.  Most children will work their way through SM with sympathetic support, although they may remain reserved and anxious in social situations. This page covers the following information and advice for professionals and parents of children with SM: Which children are affected?  When does it start?  What are the signs?  What causes selective mutism?  What can parents do?  How is it treated?  Where can I get support and advice?   Which children are affected?  SM is relatively rare, affecting one in 150 children. Most primary schools will know of at least one child with SM. It's more common in girls and children of ethnic minority populations, or in those who have recently migrated from their country of birth. When does it start?  SM usually occurs in early childhood and is first noticed when the child begins to interact outside the family circle \u2013 for example, when they start nursery or school. It can last a few months but, if left untreated, can continue into adulthood. What are the signs?  Children with SM often have other fears and social anxieties and may have additional speech and language difficulties. They may not be able to give you eye contact and may seem: nervous uneasy and socially awkward clingy excessively shy and withdrawn, dreading that they will be expected to speak  serious stubborn or aggressive, having temper tantrums when they get home from school  frozen and expressionless during periods they cannot talk Children with SM may communicate using gestures \u2013 for example, nodding or shaking their head to get their message across. They may manage to respond with a word or two, or speak in an altered voice, such as a whisper. Some children with SM also have a fear of using public toilets \u2013 perhaps because they fear making sounds while urinating that others may hear. What causes selective mutism?  It's not always clear what causes some children to develop SM, although it is known to be associated with anxiety. The child will usually have inherited a tendency to experience anxiety from a family member. Many children become very distressed when separated from their parents and transfer this anxiety to the adults who try to settle them into a new setting. If they have a speech and language disorder or hearing problem, this only makes speaking even more stressful. Some children have trouble processing sensory information such as loud noise and jostling from crowds \u2013 a condition known as sensory integration dysfunction. This can make them \"shut down\" and unable to speak when overwhelmed in a busy environment. There is no evidence to suggest that children with SM are more likely to have suffered abuse, neglect or trauma than any other child. When mutism occurs as a symptom of post-traumatic stress it follows a very different pattern and the child suddenly stops talking in environments where they previously had no difficulty. However, this type of speech withdrawal may lead to SM if the triggers are not addressed and the child develops a more general anxiety about communication. Another common misconception is that a selectively mute child is controlling or manipulative, or that the child has autism. There is no relationship between SM and autism, although the two conditions can occur in the same child. What can parents do?  If left untreated, SM can lead to isolation, low self-esteem and social anxiety disorder. It can persist into adolescence and even adulthood if not tackled. With diagnosis at a young age and appropriate management, children can successfully overcome this disorder. SM needs to be recognised early by families and schools so that they can work together to reduce the child\u2019s anxiety. Staff in early years settings and schools are increasingly seeking training so they are ready to provide appropriate support. Getting a diagnosis If you suspect your child has SM and help is not available, or if there are additional concerns \u2013 for example if your child struggles to understand instructions or follow routines \u2013 seek a formal diagnosis from a qualified speech and language therapist. Approach your nearest speech and language therapy clinic or speak to your health visitor or GP, who can refer you. Do not accept the assurance that your child will grow out of it. Older children may also need to see a mental health professional or school educational psychologist. The clinician may initially wish to talk to you without your child present, so you can speak freely about any anxieties you have about your child\u2019s development or behaviour. The clinician will want to find out if anxiety disorders are present in your family, and if there is anything in your child's life causing them significant distress, such as divorce or difficulty learning a second language. They will look at your child's behavioural characteristics and take their full medical history. Your child may not be able to speak during their assessment, but the clinician will be prepared for this and try to find another medium of communication. For example, children may be encouraged to communicate through parents, or older children may be invited to write down responses or use a computer.  SM must be diagnosed according to specific guidelines. These include observations that: your child does not speak in specific situations, such as school lessons or when they can be overheard in public your child can speak normally in situations in which they feel comfortable, such as being alone with you at home or in an empty classroom  their inability to speak interferes with their ability to function in that setting their inability to speak has lasted for at least two months their inability to speak is not better explained by another behavioural, mental or communication disorder How is it treated?  The effectiveness of treatment depends on: how long your child has had selective mutism whether or not they have additional communication or learning difficulties or anxieties the co-operation of everyone involved with the child  With appropriate handling and treatment, most children overcome selective mutism \u2013 but the older they are, the longer it takes. They should gradually progress from relaxing in their school or nursery, to saying single words and sentences to one person, before eventually being able to speak freely to all people in all settings. Treatment does not focus on the speaking itself, but focuses on reducing the anxiety that your child has for speaking to and being overheard by people outside their immediate circle of family and friends. The need for individual treatment can be avoided if family and staff in early years settings work together to reduce this anxiety by creating a positive environment for the child. This means: not letting the child know you are anxious reassuring them that they'll be able to speak when they're ready concentrating on having fun praising all efforts the child makes to join in and interact with others (such as passing and taking toys, nodding, pointing) showing no surprise when the child speaks, but responding warmly as you would to any other child As well as these environmental changes, older children may need individual support to overcome their anxiety. The most effective forms of treatment are behavioural therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy. These are briefly described below, along with some commonly used techniques to help your child overcome their anxiety.  Behavioural therapy Behavioural therapy is designed to reinforce desired behaviours and eliminate undesired behaviours.  Rather than examining your child\u2019s past or their thoughts, it concentrates on helping your child combat their difficulty in a practical way, using a step-by-step approach to help them conquer their fears. Several of the following techniques can be used at the same time by family members and school staff under the guidance of a speech and language therapist or psychologist: Stimulus fading \u2013 the child communicates at ease with someone such as their parent when nobody else is present. Gradually, another person is introduced into the situation and once they are included in talking, the parent can withdraw. The new person can introduce more people in the same way. Positive and negative reinforcement \u2013 being positive about all forms of communication and not rewarding avoidance and silence. If the child is under pressure to talk, they will experience great relief when the moment passes. This not only makes being silent far more enjoyable than trying to speak, but also strengthens the child\u2019s belief that talking is a negative experience. Desensitisation \u2013 reducing the child\u2019s sensitivity to the sound of their voice in public, and encouraging them to communicate using voice or video recordings. Older children may build contacts using email, instant messaging or online chat, and then leave voicemail messages. They can build up relationships this way until they feel ready to try more direct communication. Shaping \u2013 a technique that encourages the child to interact without speaking before being slowly coaxed into trying sounds such as clicks and hums, then whispering quiet sounds such as \u2018s\u2019, and gradually trying a word or two. Graded exposure \u2013 an older child is encouraged to work out how much anxiety different situations cause (such as answering the phone or asking a stranger the time). Situations causing the least anxiety are tackled first. With realistic targets and repeated exposure, the anxiety associated with these situations decreases to a manageable level. Cognitive behavioural therapy Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) works by helping individuals focus on how they think about themselves, the world and other people and how their perception of these things affects their thoughts and feelings. This is carried out by mental health professionals and is more appropriate for older children and adolescents, particularly those experiencing social anxiety disorder, and adults who have grown up with SM. CBT also challenges fears and preconceptions through graded exposure. Read more about CBT. Medication Medication is only really appropriate for older children and teenagers whose anxiety has led to depression and other problems. Medication should never be prescribed as an alternative to the environmental changes and behavioural approaches described above. However, antidepressants may be prescribed alongside a treatment programme to decrease anxiety levels and speed the process of therapy, especially if previous attempts to engage the child in treatment have failed. Where can I get support and advice?  The Selective Mutism Information and Research Association provides more information on SM, including training days for parents and professionals, and can put you in contact with other affected families. In addition to your nearest speech and language therapy clinic, the Association of Speech and Language Therapists in Independent Practice can put you in contact with treating professionals. Finding a professional with specialist knowledge SM has been poorly understood over the years. It is only relatively recently the medical view that children were refusing to speak has changed, and effective treatment approaches have been developed. There is a growing body of expertise among health professionals, educational psychologists and teaching staff, but parents need to be prepared for the fact that professionals in their area may not have up-to-date knowledge or experience of working with SM. If this is the case, parents should seek out teachers and health professionals who are willing to listen, learn and develop their specialist knowledge to provide appropriate support. Advice for parents Don't use pressure or bribes with a child to encourage speaking. Let your child know you understand they are scared to speak and have difficulty speaking at times. Don't praise your child publicly for speaking, as this can cause embarrassment. Wait until you are alone with them and consider a special treat for their achievement. Reassure your child that nonverbal communication (such as smiling and waving) is fine until they feel better about talking. Don't avoid parties or family visits, but consider what environmental changes are necessary to make the situation more comfortable for the child. Ask friends and relatives to give your child time to warm up at his or her own pace and to focus on fun activities rather than getting them to talk. Give them love, support and patience as well as verbal encouragement.

They're mainly prescribed to treat depression, particularly persistent or severe cases, and are often used in combination with a talking therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). SSRIs are usually the first choice medication for depression because they generally have fewer side effects than most other types of antidepressant. As well as depression, SSRIs can be used to treat a number of other mental health conditions, including: generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) panic disorder severe phobias, such as agoraphobia and social phobia bulimia post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) SSRIs can sometimes be used to treat other conditions, such as premature ejaculation, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Occasionally, they may also be prescribed to treat pain. How SSRIs work It's thought that SSRIs work by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter (a messenger chemical that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain). It's thought to have a good influence on mood, emotion and sleep. After carrying a message, serotonin is usually reabsorbed by the nerve cells (known as \"reuptake\"). SSRIs work by blocking (\"inhibiting\") reuptake, meaning more serotonin is available to pass further messages between nearby nerve cells. It would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, but a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms and make people more responsive to other types of treatment, such as CBT. Doses and duration of treatment SSRIs are usually taken in tablet form. When they're prescribed, you'll start on the lowest possible dose thought necessary to improve your symptoms. SSRIs usually need to be taken for two to four weeks before the benefit is felt. You may experience mild side effects early on, but it's important that you don't stop taking the medication. These effects will usually wear off quickly. If you take an SSRI for four to six weeks without feeling any benefit, speak to your GP or mental health specialist. They may recommend increasing your dose or trying an alternative antidepressant. A course of treatment usually lasts for at least six months, although longer courses are sometimes recommended and some people with recurrent problems may be advised to take them indefinitely. Read more about SSRI doses. Things to consider SSRIs aren't suitable for everyone. They're not usually recommended if you're pregnant, breastfeeding or under 18, because there's an increased risk of serious side effects. However, exceptions can be made if the benefits of treatment are thought to outweigh the risks. SSRIs also need to be used with caution if you have certain underlying health problems, including diabetes, epilepsy and kidney disease. Some SSRIs can react unpredictably with other medicines, including some over-the-counter painkillers and herbal remedies, such as St John\u2019s wort. Always read the information leaflet that comes with your SSRI medication to check if there are any medicines you need to avoid. Read more about the cautions and interactions of SSRIs. Side effects Most people will only experience a few mild side effects when taking SSRIs. These can be troublesome at first, but they'll generally improve with time. Common side effects of SSRIs can include: feeling agitated, shaky or anxious feeling or being sick dizziness blurred vision low sex drive difficulty achieving orgasm during sex or masturbation in men, difficulty obtaining or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) You'll usually need to see your doctor every few weeks when you first start taking SSRIs to discuss how well the medication is working. You can also contact your doctor at any point if you experience any troublesome or persistent side effects. Read more about the side effects of SSRIs. Types of SSRIs There are currently seven SSRIs prescribed in the UK: citalopram (Cipramil) dapoxetine (Priligy) escitalopram (Cipralex) fluoxetine (Prozac or Oxactin) fluvoxamine (Faverin) paroxetine (Seroxat) sertraline (Lustral) You can find more information and advice about these SSRIs on the Medicines Complete website.

It's usually a way of coping with or expressing overwhelming emotional distress. Sometimes when people self-harm, they feel on some level that they intend to die. Over half of people who die by suicide have a history of self-harm. However, the intention is more often to punish themselves, express their distress or relieve unbearable tension. Sometimes the reason is a mixture of both. Self-harm can also be a cry for help. Getting help If you're self-harming, you should see your GP for help. They can refer you to healthcare professionals at a local community mental health service for further assessment. This assessment will result in your care team working out a treatment plan with you to help with your distress. Treatment for people who self-harm usually involves seeing a therapist to discuss your thoughts and feelings, and how these affect your behaviour and wellbeing. They can also teach you coping strategies to help prevent further episodes of self-harm. If you're badly depressed, it could also involve taking antidepressants or other medication. Read more about getting help if you self-harm. Useful organisations There are organisations that offer support and advice for people who self-harm, as well as their friends and families. These include: Samaritans \u2013 call 116 123 (open 24 hours a day), email: jo@samaritans.org or visit your local Samaritans branch Mind \u2013 call 0300 123 3393 or text 86463 (9am-6pm on weekdays) Harmless \u2013 email info@harmless.org.uk National Self Harm Network forums YoungMinds Parents Helpline \u2013 call 0808 802 5544 (9.30-4pm on weekdays) Find more mental health helplines. Types of self-harm There are many different ways people can intentionally harm themselves, such as: cutting or burning their skin punching or hitting themselves poisoning themselves with tablets or toxic chemicals misusing alcohol or drugs deliberately starving themselves (anorexia nervosa) or binge eating (bulimia nervosa) excessively exercising People often try to keep self-harm a secret because of shame or fear of discovery. For example, if they're cutting themselves, they may cover up their skin and avoid discussing the problem. It's often up to close family and friends to notice when somebody is self-harming, and to approach the subject with care and understanding.  Signs of self-harm If you think a friend or relative is self-harming, look out for any of the following signs: unexplained cuts, bruises or cigarette burns, usually on their wrists, arms, thighs and chest keeping themselves fully covered at all times, even in hot weather signs of depression, such as low mood, tearfulness or a lack of motivation or interest in anything self-loathing and expressing a wish to punish themselves not wanting to go on and wishing to end it all becoming very withdrawn and not speaking to others changes in eating habits or being secretive about eating, and any unusual weight loss or weight gain signs of low self-esteem, such as blaming themselves for any problems or thinking they're not good enough for something signs they have been pulling out their hair signs of alcohol or drugs misuse People who self-harm can seriously hurt themselves, so it's important that they speak to a GP about the underlying issue and request treatment or therapy that could help them. Why people self-harm Self-harm is more common than many people realise, especially among younger people. It's estimated around 10% of young people self-harm at some point, but people of all ages do. This figure is also likely to be an underestimate, as not everyone seeks help. In most cases, people who self-harm do it to help them cope with overwhelming emotional issues, which may be caused by: social problems \u2013 such as being bullied, having difficulties at work or school, having difficult relationships with friends or family, coming to terms with their sexuality if they think they might be gay or bisexual, or coping with cultural expectations, such as an arranged marriage trauma \u2013 such as physical or sexual abuse, the death of a close family member or friend, or having a miscarriage psychological causes \u2013 such as having repeated thoughts or voices telling them to self-harm, disassociating (losing touch with who they are and with their surroundings), or borderline personality disorder These issues can lead to a build-up of intense feelings of anger, guilt, hopelessness and self-hatred. The person may not know who to turn to for help and self-harming may become a way to release these pent-up feelings. Self-harm is linked to anxiety and depression. These mental health conditions can affect people of any age. Self-harm can also occur alongside antisocial behaviour, such as misbehaving at school or getting into trouble with the police. Although some people who self-harm are at a high risk of suicide, many people who self-harm don't want to end their lives. In fact, the self-harm may help them cope with emotional distress, so they don't feel the need to kill themselves.

The semen may be blood stained, brownish-red in colour or have a pink tinge. This page is intended to give you a better idea of the possible causes, but you shouldn't use it to diagnose yourself with a condition \u2013 always see your GP for a proper diagnosis. In many cases, no obvious cause can be found for blood in the semen and it will clear up by itself. Common causes Common causes of blood in semen include: vesiculitis \u2013 inflammation of the seminal vesicles (glands that produce most of the fluid in ejaculate) seminal vesicle cysts \u2013 small, fluid-filled sacs in the seminal vesicles prostatitis \u2013 inflammation of the prostate gland (where semen is made) recent urological surgery \u2013 such as a prostate biopsy, cystoscopy or vasectomy sexually transmitted infections (STIs) \u2013 such as genital herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhoea or trichomoniasis These problems generally aren't serious and many will get better on their own without treatment, or after a course of antibiotics or anti-inflammatory painkillers. Less common causes Less often, blood in the semen can be a result of: severe high blood pressure (hypertension) a blood clotting disorder cancer \u2013 including prostate cancer, testicular cancer and bladder cancer seminal vesicle calculi \u2013 small stones in the seminal vesicles These conditions are more serious and may require specialist treatment. Seeing your GP Your GP will try to determine whether the cause of the blood in your semen is likely to be serious or not. They'll need to consider a number of things, such as: how many times you've noticed blood in your semen whether you have any other symptoms your age your medical history They may also need to carry out a number of simple tests, including: checking your blood pressure an examination of your genitals and abdomen (tummy) a rectal examination (where your doctor inserts a finger into your bottom) urine and blood tests If you're younger than 40, have only noticed blood in your semen once or twice, and tests don't suggest you have a serious underlying condition, you shouldn't need a hospital referral. However, if you're over 40, have persistent or recurrent symptoms, or tests have suggested a potentially serious underlying cause, your GP should refer you to a urologist (specialist who treats problems of the urinary system). A further assessment with a urologist may involve having a biopsy of your prostate gland or a scan, such as an ultrasound scan. Treating blood in semen The treatment your GP or urologist recommends will depend on what they think is the underlying reason for the blood in your semen. In many cases, particularly if you have no other symptoms or the blood in your semen was an isolated incident, no treatment is necessary and the problem will usually resolve on its own. If a clear reason is identified, the treatment you're offered will depend on the specific cause. For example, you may be given antibiotics to treat an infection and cysts may need to be drained with a needle. If there's a serious underlying cause, such as a blood clotting disorder or cancer, you'll be referred to an appropriate specialist for any necessary treatment.

In sepsis, the body's immune system goes into overdrive as it tries to fight an infection. This can reduce the blood supply to vital organs such as the brain, heart and kidneys. Without quick treatment, sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death. Symptoms Early symptoms of sepsis may include: a high temperature (fever) or low body temperature chills and shivering a fast heartbeat fast breathing In some cases, symptoms of more severe sepsis or septic shock (when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level) develop soon after. These can include: feeling dizzy or faint a change in mental state \u2013 such as confusion or disorientation diarrhoea  nausea and vomiting slurred speech severe muscle pain severe breathlessness less urine production than normal \u2013 for example, not urinating for a day cold, clammy and pale or mottled skin loss of consciousness When to seek medical advice See your GP immediately or call NHS 111 if you've recently had an infection or injury and you have possible early signs of sepsis. If sepsis is suspected, you'll usually be referred to hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. Severe sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies. If you think you or someone in your care has one of these conditions, call 999 and ask for an ambulance. How is sepsis diagnosed? Sepsis is often diagnosed based on simple measurements such as your temperature, heart rate and breathing rate, and may require a simple blood test. Other tests that can help determine the type of infection, where it's located and which body functions have been affected include: urine or stool samples a wound culture \u2013 where a small sample of tissue, skin or fluid is taken from the affected area for testing respiratory secretion testing \u2013 taking a sample of saliva, phlegm or mucus blood pressure tests imaging studies \u2013 such as an X-ray, ultrasound scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan How sepsis is treated If sepsis is detected early and hasn't affected vital organs yet, it may be possible to treat the infection at home with antibiotics. Most people who have sepsis detected at this stage make a full recovery. Almost all people with severe sepsis and septic shock require admission to hospital. Some people may require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Because of problems with vital organs, people with severe sepsis are likely to be very ill and the condition can be fatal. However, sepsis is treatable if it is identified and treated quickly, and in most cases leads to a full recovery with no lasting problems. Read more about treating sepsis. Recovering from sepsis The amount of time it takes to fully recover from sepsis varies, depending on factors such as: the severity of the sepsis the person's overall health how much time was spent in hospital whether treatment was needed in an ICU Some people make a full recovery quicker than others, and not everyone experiences long-term problems. However, possible problems may include physical symptoms, such as: feeling lethargic or excessively tired muscle weakness swollen limbs or joint pain chest pain or breathlessness post-sepsis syndrome Being seriously ill can also have a psychological or emotional impact, leading to problems such as: anxiety or fear depression nightmares or insomnia poor concentration or short-term memory loss Read more about recovering from sepsis on the UK Sepsis Trust website. Who's at risk? Each year it's estimated more than 100,000 people in the UK are admitted to hospital with sepsis. Around 31,000 people die every year as a result of the condition. Anyone can develop sepsis after an injury or minor infection, although some people are more vulnerable. People most at risk of sepsis include those: with a medical condition or receiving medical treatment that weakens their immune system who are already in hospital with a serious illness who are very young or very old who have just had surgery or who have wounds or injuries as a result of an accident Read more about the causes of sepsis. Sepsis, septicaemia and blood poisoning Although sepsis is often referred to as either blood poisoning or septicaemia, these terms refer to the invasion of bacteria into the bloodstream. Sepsis can affect multiple organs or the entire body, even without blood poisoning or septicaemia. Sepsis can also be caused by viral or fungal infections, although bacterial infections are by far the most common cause.

It is also known as infectious or bacterial arthritis. The condition is most commonly caused by staphylococcal or streptococcal bacteria. These bacteria may have entered a wound and travelled through your bloodstream to the affected joint, or may have infected your joint directly following an injury or during surgery. Any joint can be affected by septic arthritis \u2013 and more than one joint can be affected at a time \u2013 but the condition is most common in the knees and hips. You should see your GP or visit your local accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible if you think you or your child may have septic arthritis. The sooner the infection is picked up and treated, the better the outlook. If the condition is left untreated, it can become life-threatening and can lead to permanent joint damage. Signs and symptoms Septic arthritis typically causes severe pain, swelling, redness and heat in affected joints. These symptoms tend to develop quickly over a few hours or days. You may also have difficulty moving the affected joint and some people have a high temperature (fever). Young children with septic arthritis will generally be irritable and may cry whenever the infected joint is moved (for example, during nappy changing). They may also try to avoid using or putting any weight on affected joints. Who's at risk? Septic arthritis can be seen at any age, including in babies and infants, although it is less common in older children, teenagers and young adults. The following factors can increase your risk of septic arthritis: having an artificial joint implant, such as a knee replacement or hip replacement having a bacterial infection somewhere else in your body having a long-term condition such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis using injected drugs taking medication that suppresses your immune system recently injuring a joint recently having joint surgery or injections into your joints Diagnosis septic arthritis If your symptoms suggest septic arthritis, your GP will refer you to your nearest A&E department immediately for an assessment. You may have a blood test and a sample of fluid removed from your affected joint with a needle to look for signs of inflammation and infection, and to identify any bacteria. If you have septic arthritis, there may be high numbers of white blood cells (a sign of infection) in your blood and joint fluid. However, in many cases these tests come back normal, so they cannot be relied upon to rule out the infection. Treating septic arthritis Septic arthritis is treated with antibiotics. You will normally need to stay in hospital for at least two weeks to have antibiotics given to you intravenously (directly into a vein). You may need to rest in bed for a few days to take pressure off the affected joint and you will be given medication to relieve the pain. You might also have the fluid drained from your infected joint using a needle and syringe, or during a procedure called an arthroscopy (where a fine, metal tube is inserted through a small incision near the affected joint). This will normally be done by the orthopaedic surgeon. After you finish the course of intravenous antibiotics, you'll probably need to take antibiotic tablets at home for at least another four weeks. You should completely recover after antibiotic treatment, although some people still experience persistent limited movement in the affected joint.

Any type of bacteria can cause the infection. Fungi such as candida and viruses can also be a cause, although this is rare. At first the infection can lead to a reaction called sepsis. This begins with weakness, chills, and a rapid heart and breathing rate. Left untreated, toxins produced by bacteria can damage the small blood vessels, causing them to leak fluid into the surrounding tissues. This can affect your heart's ability to pump blood to your organs, which lowers your blood pressure and means blood doesn't reach vital organs, such as the brain and liver. People with a weakened immune system have an increased risk of developing septic shock. This includes: newborn babies elderly people pregnant women people with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, cirrhosis or kidney failure people with lowered immune systems, such as those with HIV or AIDS or those receiving chemotherapy Symptoms of septic shock Symptoms of septic shock include: low blood pressure (hypotension) that makes you feel dizzy when you stand up a change in your mental state, such as confusion or disorientation diarrhoea nausea and vomiting cold, clammy and pale skin Septic shock is a medical emergency. Dial 999 to ask for an ambulance if you think that you or someone in your care has septic shock. Treating septic shock You'll usually be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) so your body's functions and organs can be supported while the infection is treated. In some cases treatment may start in the emergency department. Treatment may include: oxygen therapy fluids given directly through a vein (intravenously) medication to increase your blood flow antibiotics  surgery (in some cases) Read more about treating septic shock. Complications of septic shock The chances of surviving septic shock will depend on: the cause of infection the number of organs that have failed how soon treatment is started Complications of septic shock can include: inability of the lungs to take in enough oxygen (respiratory failure) the heart not being able to pump enough blood around the body (heart failure) kidney failure or injury  abnormal blood clotting These are serious health conditions that will need to be treated urgently. Septic shock can be fatal because of complications like these. Sepsis Sepsis occurs when an infection spreads through the blood, causing symptoms throughout the whole body. It's sometimes referred to as septicaemia or blood poisoning, but these terms aren't the same as sepsis. Sepsis is where the body's defence mechanisms respond to an infection in some part of the body, resulting in symptoms such as a fever, raised pulse rate, raised breathing and confusion. Septicaemia \u2013 another name for blood poisoning \u2013 is a bacterial infection of the blood that leads to the spread of infection and organ damage.

In sepsis, the body's immune system goes into overdrive as it tries to fight an infection. This can reduce the blood supply to vital organs such as the brain, heart and kidneys. Without quick treatment, sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death. Symptoms Early symptoms of sepsis may include: a high temperature (fever) or low body temperature chills and shivering a fast heartbeat fast breathing In some cases, symptoms of more severe sepsis or septic shock (when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level) develop soon after. These can include: feeling dizzy or faint a change in mental state \u2013 such as confusion or disorientation diarrhoea  nausea and vomiting slurred speech severe muscle pain severe breathlessness less urine production than normal \u2013 for example, not urinating for a day cold, clammy and pale or mottled skin loss of consciousness When to seek medical advice See your GP immediately or call NHS 111 if you've recently had an infection or injury and you have possible early signs of sepsis. If sepsis is suspected, you'll usually be referred to hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. Severe sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies. If you think you or someone in your care has one of these conditions, call 999 and ask for an ambulance. How is sepsis diagnosed? Sepsis is often diagnosed based on simple measurements such as your temperature, heart rate and breathing rate, and may require a simple blood test. Other tests that can help determine the type of infection, where it's located and which body functions have been affected include: urine or stool samples a wound culture \u2013 where a small sample of tissue, skin or fluid is taken from the affected area for testing respiratory secretion testing \u2013 taking a sample of saliva, phlegm or mucus blood pressure tests imaging studies \u2013 such as an X-ray, ultrasound scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan How sepsis is treated If sepsis is detected early and hasn't affected vital organs yet, it may be possible to treat the infection at home with antibiotics. Most people who have sepsis detected at this stage make a full recovery. Almost all people with severe sepsis and septic shock require admission to hospital. Some people may require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Because of problems with vital organs, people with severe sepsis are likely to be very ill and the condition can be fatal.

Biological sex is assigned at birth, depending on the appearance of the genitals. Gender identity is the gender that a person \"identifies\" with or feels themselves to be. While biological sex and gender identity are the same for most people, this isn't the case for everyone. For example, some people may have the anatomy of a man, but identify themselves as a woman, while others may not feel they're definitively either male or female. This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. It's not a mental illness. Some people with gender dysphoria have a strong and persistent desire to live according to their gender identity, rather than their biological sex. These people are sometimes called transsexual or trans people. Some trans people have treatment to make their physical appearance more consistent with their gender identity. Signs of gender dysphoria The first signs of gender dysphoria can appear at a very young age. For example, a child may refuse to wear typical boys' or girls' clothes, or dislike taking part in typical boys' or girls' games and activities. In most cases, this type of behaviour is just a normal part of growing up and will pass in time, but for those with gender dysphoria it continues through childhood and into adulthood. Adults with gender dysphoria can feel trapped inside a body that doesn't match their gender identity. They may feel so unhappy about conforming to societal expectations that they live according to their anatomical sex, rather than the gender they feel themselves to be. They may also have a strong desire to change or get rid of physical signs of their biological sex, such as facial hair or breasts. Read more about the symptoms of gender dysphoria. Getting help See your GP if you think you or your child may have gender dysphoria. If necessary, they can refer you to a specialist Gender Identity Clinic (GIC). Staff at these clinics can carry out a personalised assessment and provide any support you need. Assessment A diagnosis of gender dysphoria can usually be made after an in-depth assessment carried out by two or more specialists. This may require several sessions, carried out a few months apart, and may involve discussions with people you are close to, such as members of your family or your partner. The assessment will determine whether you have gender dysphoria and what your needs are, which could include: whether there's a clear mismatch between your biological sex and gender identity whether you have a strong desire to change your physical characteristics as a result of any mismatch how you're coping with any difficulties of a possible mismatch how your feelings and behaviours have developed over time what support you have, such as friends and family The assessment may also involve a more general assessment of your physical and psychological health. Treatment for gender dysphoria If the results of an assessment suggest that you or your child have gender dysphoria, staff at the GIC will work with you to come up with an individual treatment plan. This will include any psychological support you may need. Treatment for gender dysphoria aims to help reduce or remove the distressing feelings of a mismatch between biological sex and gender identity. This can mean different things for different people. For some people, it can mean dressing and living as their preferred gender. For others, it can mean taking hormones or also having surgery to change their physical appearance. Many trans people have treatment to change their body permanently, so they're more consistent with their gender identity, and the vast majority are satisfied with the eventual results. Read more about treating gender dysphoria. What causes gender dysphoria? Gender development is complex and there are many possible variations that cause a mismatch between a person\u2019s biological sex and their gender identity, making the exact cause of gender dysphoria unclear. Occasionally, the hormones that trigger the development of biological sex may not work properly on the brain, reproductive organs and genitals, causing differences between them. This may be caused by: additional hormones in the mother\u2019s system \u2013 possibly as a result of taking medication the foetus\u2019 insensitivity to the hormones, known as androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) \u2013 when this happens, gender dysphoria may be caused by hormones not working properly in the womb Gender dysphoria may also be the result of other rare conditions, such as: congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) \u2013 where a high level of male hormones are produced in a female foetus. This causes the genitals to become more male in appearance and, in some cases, the baby may be thought to be biologically male when she is born. intersex conditions \u2013 which cause babies to be born with the genitalia of both sexes (or ambiguous genitalia). Parents are recommended to wait until the child can choose their own gender identity before any surgery is carried out. Read more about disorders of sex development. How common is gender dysphoria? It's not known exactly how many people experience gender dysphoria, because many people with the condition never seek help. A survey of 10,000 people undertaken in 2012 by the Equality and Human Rights Commission found that 1% of the population surveyed was gender variant, to some extent. While gender dysphoria appears to be rare, the number of people being diagnosed with the condition is increasing, due to growing public awareness. However, many people with gender dysphoria still face prejudice and misunderstanding. Gender terminology Gender dysphoria is a complex condition that can be difficult to understand. Therefore, it helps to distinguish between the meanings of different gender-related terms: gender dysphoria \u2013 discomfort or distress caused by a mismatch between a person\u2019s gender identity and their biological sex assigned at birth transsexualism \u2013 the desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex, usually accompanied by the wish to have treatment to make their physical appearance more consistent with their gender identity transvestism \u2013 where a person occasionally wears clothes typically associated with the opposite gender (cross-dressing) for a variety of reasons genderqueer \u2013 an umbrella term used to describe gender identities other than man and woman \u2013 for example, those who are both man and woman, or neither man nor woman, or moving between genders Gender dysphoria isn't the same as transvestism or cross-dressing and isn't related to sexual orientation.

Most infections can be cured. A sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic specialises in sexual health, and can provide tests and treatment for many STIs. Visiting an STI clinic You can make an appointment to go to an STI clinic, or sometimes there's a drop-in clinic, which means you can just turn up without the need for an appointment. You might feel embarrassed, but there's no need \u2013 the staff at these clinics are used to testing for all kinds of infections. It's their job and they won't judge you. They should do their best to explain everything to you and make you feel at ease. You can go to a sexual health clinic whether you're male or female, whatever your age, regardless of whether or not you have STI symptoms. If you're under 16, the service is still confidential and the clinic won't tell your parents. If they suspect you or another young person is at risk of harm, they might need to tell other healthcare services, but they will talk to you before they do this.  Find sexual health services near you, including sexual health and GUM clinics. Your name and details When you go to a sexual health clinic, you'll be asked for your name and some contact details. You don't have to give your real name if you don't want to. If you do, it will be kept confidential. Your GP won't be told about your visit without your permission. If you have tests and the results aren't available during your visit, the clinic will need to contact you later, so give them the correct contact details. The clinic will ask how you want to receive your results. They can usually be given to you over the phone, by text, or in an unmarked letter. Answering some questions You will see a doctor or a nurse, who will ask you about your medical and sexual history. Be prepared to answer questions about your sex life, including: when you last had sex whether you've had unprotected sex whether you have any symptoms why you think you might have an infection You can ask to see a female or male doctor or nurse if you prefer, but you might have to wait longer than usual for one to become available.  Having STI tests The doctor or nurse will tell you what tests they think you need. They should explain what is going on and why they are suggesting these tests. If you're not sure about anything, ask them to explain. The tests might involve: a urine (pee) sample a blood sample swabs from the urethra (the tube urine comes out of) an examination of your genitals if you're female, swabs from the vagina, which you can usually do yourself Testing for chlamydia and gonorrhoea usually requires only a urine sample or a self-taken swab for a woman. Testing for HIV and syphilis needs a blood sample. Tests for herpes aren't usually done unless you have sores on your genitals or anus. In this case, a swab will be taken from a sore. This will be uncomfortable for a moment. Find out more about: chlamydia testing  herpes testing syphilis testing gonorrhoea testing HIV testing Getting your test results With some tests, you can get the results \u2013 and treatment, if you need it \u2013 on the same day. For others, you might have to wait for a week or two. If this is the case, the clinic will check how you would prefer to receive your results. If you test positive for an STI, you will be asked to go back to the clinic to talk about your results and the treatment you need. Many STIs can be cured with antibiotics. Some infections, such as HIV, have no cure, but there are treatments available. The clinic can advise you on these and put you in touch with a counsellor. If possible, tell your sexual partner and any ex-partners so they can get tested and treated as well. If you don't want to do this, the clinic can usually do it for you \u2013 it's called partner notification and the clinic won't reveal who you are. Using condoms to protect against STIs The best way to protect yourself from getting or passing on an infection is to use a condom every time you have sex. The clinic can give you some condoms so you can practice safer sex. Always buy condoms that have the CE mark or BSI kite mark on the packet. This means they've been tested to high safety standards. Condoms that don't have the CE mark or BSI kite mark won't meet these standards, so don't use them. Get tips on using condoms properly. Bear in mind that having had an STI once doesn't make you immune to it \u2013 you can get the same infection again.  Other places to go for help Sexual health and GUM clinics have the greatest expertise in testing and treatments for STIs, but you can also go to: your GP a young people's sexual health service \u2013 call the national sexual health line on 0300 123 7123 a community contraception clinic  a pharmacy They may be able to offer tests for some infections and advise you on where to go for further help.  Further information Does anal sex have any health risks?

You can be tested for STIs at a sexual health clinic, genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic or GP surgery. Search for a sexual health clinic near you and find out what services they offer. This page provides an overview of the different STIs and links to more information about these conditions. Chlamydia Chlamydia is the most common STI in the UK and is easily passed on during sex. Most people don't experience any symptoms, so they are unaware they're infected. In women, chlamydia can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a vaginal discharge, pain in the lower abdomen during or after sex, and bleeding during or after sex or between periods. It can also cause heavy periods. In men, chlamydia can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a white, cloudy or watery discharge from the tip of the penis, and pain or tenderness in the testicles. It's also possible to have a chlamydia infection in your rectum (bottom), throat or eyes. Diagnosing chlamydia is done with a urine test or by taking a swab of the affected area. The infection is easily treated with antibiotics, but can lead to serious long-term health problems if left untreated, including infertility.  Read more about chlamydia. Genital warts Genital warts are small fleshy growths, bumps or skin changes that appear on or around your genital or anal area. They're caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV) and are the second most common STI in England after chlamydia. The warts are usually painless, but you may notice some itching or redness. Occasionally, they can cause bleeding. You don't need to have penetrative sex to pass the infection on because HPV is spread by skin-to-skin contact. Several treatments are available for genital warts, including creams and freezing the warts (cryotherapy). Read more about genital warts.  Genital herpes Genital herpes is a common infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is the same virus that causes cold sores. Some people develop symptoms of HSV a few days after coming into contact with the virus. Small, painful blisters or sores usually develop, which may cause itching or tingling, or make it painful to urinate. After you've been infected, the virus remains dormant (inactive) most of the time. However, certain triggers can reactivate the virus, causing the blisters to develop again, although they're usually smaller and less painful. It's easier to test for HSV if you have symptoms. Although there's no cure for genital herpes, the symptoms can usually be controlled using antiviral medicines. Read more about genital herpes. Gonorrhoea Gonorrhoea is a bacterial STI easily passed on during sex. About 50% of women and 10% of men don't experience any symptoms and are unaware they're infected. In women, gonorrhoea can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a vaginal discharge (often watery, yellow or green), pain in the lower abdomen during or after sex, and bleeding during or after sex or between periods, sometimes causing heavy periods. In men, gonorrhoea can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a white, yellow or green discharge from the tip of the penis, and pain or tenderness in the testicles. It's also possible to have a gonorrhoea infection in your rectum, throat or eyes. Gonorrhoea is diagnosed using a urine test or by taking a swab of the affected area. The infection is easily treated with antibiotics, but can lead to serious long-term health problems if left untreated, including infertility. Read more about gonorrhoea. Syphilis Syphilis is a bacterial infection that in the early stages causes a painless, but highly infectious, sore on your genitals or around the mouth. The sore can last up to six weeks before disappearing. Secondary symptoms such as a rash, flu-like illness or patchy hair loss may then develop. These may disappear within a few weeks, after which you'll have a symptom-free phase. The late or tertiary stage of syphilis usually occurs after many years, and can cause serious conditions such as heart problems, paralysis and blindness. The symptoms of syphilis can be difficult to recognise. A simple blood test can usually be used to diagnose syphilis at any stage. The condition can be treated with antibiotics, usually penicillin injections. When syphilis is treated properly, the later stages can be prevented. Read more about syphilis. HIV HIV is most commonly passed on through unprotected sex. It can also be transmitted by coming into contact with infected blood \u2013 for example, sharing needles to inject steroids or drugs. The HIV virus attacks and weakens the immune system, making it less able to fight infections and disease. There's no cure for HIV, but there are treatments that allow most people to live a long and otherwise healthy life. AIDS is the final stage of an HIV infection, when your body can no longer fight life-threatening infections. Most people with HIV look and feel healthy and have no symptoms. When you first develop HIV, you may experience a flu-like illness with a fever, sore throat or rash. This is called a seroconversion illness. A simple blood test is usually used to test for an HIV infection. Some clinics may also offer a rapid test using a finger-prick blood test or saliva sample. Read more about HIV and AIDS and coping with a positive HIV test. Trichomoniasis Trichomoniasis is an STI caused by a tiny parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). It can be easily passed on through sex and most people don't know they're infected. In women, trichomoniasis can cause a frothy yellow or watery vaginal discharge that has an unpleasant smell, soreness or itching around the vagina, and pain when passing urine. In men, trichomoniasis rarely causes symptoms. You may experience pain or burning after passing urine, a whitish discharge, or an inflamed foreskin. Trichomoniasis can sometimes be difficult to diagnose and your GP may suggest you go to a specialist clinic for a urine or swab test. Once diagnosed, it can usually be treated with antibiotics. Read more about trichomoniasis. Pubic lice Pubic lice (\"crabs\") are easily passed to others through close genital contact. They're usually found in pubic hair, but can live in underarm hair, body hair, beards and occasionally eyebrows or eyelashes. The lice crawl from hair to hair but don't jump or fly from person to person. It may take several weeks for you to notice any symptoms. Most people experience itching, and you may notice the lice or eggs on the hairs. Pubic lice can usually be successfully treated with special creams or shampoos available over the counter in most pharmacies or from a GP or GUM clinic. You don't need to shave off your pubic hair or body hair. Read more about pubic lice. Scabies Scabies is caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin. It can be passed on through close body or sexual contact, or from infected clothing, bedding or towels. If you develop scabies, you may have intense itching that's worse at night. The itching can be in your genital area, but it also often occurs between your fingers, on wrists and ankles, under your arms, or on your body and breasts. You may have a rash or tiny spots. In some people, scabies can be confused with eczema. It's usually very difficult to see the mites. Scabies can usually be successfully treated using special creams or shampoos available over the counter in most pharmacies, or from a GP or GUM clinic. The itching can sometimes continue for a short period, even after effective treatment. Read more about scabies.

The foreskin (the loose flap of skin that covers the head of the penis) is also often affected. Balanitis is a common condition affecting both boys and men. It occurs more often in men who have not been circumcised. Symptoms can include: redness, swelling and soreness around the head of the penis or foreskin a thick discharge under the foreskin a rash on the penis itchiness an unpleasant odour pain when urinating Some people may also have a tight foreskin that will not retract (pull back). This is called phimosis. When to seek medical advice Balanitis is not usually serious, but it can be a sign of another condition, such as a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or thrush (a type of fungal infection). It's therefore important to visit your GP or a local sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic if you think you have balanitis. You should also see your GP if your son has symptoms of balanitis. Read more about diagnosing balanitis. What causes balanitis? Skin irritation is the most common cause of balanitis in boys. This can occur because it's not always possible to pull back the foreskin fully at this age, leading to a build-up of a cheesy-looking substance called smegma that can irritate the skin. Irritation by smegma is also a common cause of balanitis in uncircumcised men if the penis is not kept clean. Other causes of balanitis include: irritation caused by urine or substances such as soaps and shower gels (contact dermatitis) thrush, which is more common in people with diabetes or who have recently taken antibiotics a bacterial infection, usually caused by streptococcal bacteria sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as gonorrhoea, genital herpes and syphilis skin conditions, such as atopic eczema, psoriasis, lichen sclerosus and lichen planus in boys, repeatedly playing with their foreskin In some cases, no cause can be found. How balanitis is treated Most cases of balanitis are easily managed with a combination of creams or ointments, good hygiene and avoiding substances that irritate the penis (see below). This may include corticosteroid, antibiotic and antifungal creams and ointments, depending on what the underlying cause of the condition is. These treatments will usually start to have an effect within a week and can be stopped after around two weeks, although in some people it does eventually come back after treatment. A partial circumcision may sometimes be recommended for a small number of cases of recurring phimosis. Read more about treating balanitis. Preventing balanitis You can reduce your chances of developing balanitis by: avoiding potential irritants, such as soaps, bubble baths and latex condoms keeping your penis clean \u2013 you should wash it with water every day avoiding STIs \u2013 use condoms whenever you have sex and don't share sex toys Babies and young children who still wear nappies should have their nappies changed regularly because the warm and moist conditions can increase their risk of balanitis.

It's passed on from one person to another through unprotected sex (sex without a condom) and is particularly common in sexually active teenagers and young adults. If you live in England, are under 25 and are sexually active, it's recommended that you get tested for chlamydia every year or when you change sexual partner. In 2013, more than 200,000 people tested positive for chlamydia in England. Almost 7 in every 10 people diagnosed with the condition were under 25 years old. Symptoms of chlamydia Most people with chlamydia don't notice any symptoms and don't know they have it. If you do develop symptoms, you may experience: pain when urinating unusual discharge from the vagina, penis or rectum (back passage) in women, pain in the tummy, bleeding during or after sex, and bleeding between periods in men, pain and swelling in the testicles If you think you're at risk of having an STI or have any symptoms of chlamydia, visit your GP, community contraceptive service or local genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic to get tested. Read more about chlamydia symptoms. How do you get chlamydia? Chlamydia is a bacterial infection. The bacteria are usually spread through sex or contact with infected genital fluids (semen or vaginal fluid). You can get chlamydia through: unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex sharing sex toys that aren't washed or covered with a new condom each time they're used your genitals coming into contact with your partner's genitals \u2013 this means you can get chlamydia from someone even if there is no penetration, orgasm or ejaculation infected semen or vaginal fluid getting into your eye It can also be passed by a pregnant woman to her baby \u2013 read about the complications of chlamydia for more information about this. Chlamydia can't be passed on through casual contact, such as kissing and hugging, or from sharing baths, towels, swimming pools, toilet seats or cutlery. Is chlamydia serious? Although chlamydia doesn't usually cause any symptoms and can normally be treated with a short course of antibiotics, it can be serious if it's not treated early on. If left untreated, the infection can spread to other parts of your body and lead to long-term health problems, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), epididymo-orchitis (inflammation of the testicles), and infertility. It can also sometimes cause reactive arthritis. This is why it's important to get tested and treated as soon as possible if you think you might have chlamydia. Read more about the complications of chlamydia. Getting tested for chlamydia Testing for chlamydia is done with a urine test or a swab test. You don't always need a physical examination by a nurse or doctor. Anyone can get a free and confidential chlamydia test at a sexual health clinic, a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic or a GP surgery. People under 25 years old can also get tested by the National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP). This is often in places such as pharmacies, contraception clinics or colleges. If you live in England, you're under 25 and you're sexually active, you should get tested for chlamydia every year or when you change sexual partner, as you're more likely to catch it. You can also buy chlamydia testing kits to do at home, although the accuracy of these tests varies. If you do use one of these tests, speak to your pharmacist or GP for advice. Read more about getting a chlamydia test. How chlamydia is treated Chlamydia can usually be treated easily with antibiotics. You may be given some tablets to take all on one day, or a longer course of capsules to take for a week. You shouldn't have sex until you and your current sexual partner have finished your treatment. If you had the one-day course of treatment, you should avoid having sex for a week afterwards. It's important that your current sexual partner and any other sexual partners you've had during the last six months are also tested and treated to help stop the spread of the infection. The NCSP recommends that under 25s who have chlamydia should be offered another test around three months after being treated. This is because young adults who test positive for chlamydia are at increased risk of catching it again. Sexual health or GUM clinics can help you contact your sexual partners. Either you or the clinic can speak to them, or they can be sent a note advising them to get tested. The note won't have your name on it, so your confidentiality will be protected. Read more about treating chlamydia. Preventing chlamydia Anyone who is sexually active can catch chlamydia. You're most at risk if you have a new sexual partner or don't use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, when having sex. You can help to prevent the spread of chlamydia by: using a condom every time you have vaginal or anal sex using a condom to cover the penis during oral sex using a dam (a piece of thin, soft plastic or latex) to cover the female genitals during oral sex or when rubbing female genitals together not sharing sex toys If you do share sex toys, wash them or cover them with a new condom between each person who uses them.

It causes painful blisters on the genitals and the surrounding areas. As genital herpes can be passed to others through intimate sexual contact, it's often referred to as a sexually transmitted infection (STI). HSV can affect any mucous membrane (moist lining), such as those found in the mouth (cold sores). Genital herpes is a chronic (long-term) condition. The virus remains in your body and can become active again. The average rate of recurrence is four to five times in the first two years after being infected. However, over time, it tends to become active less frequently and each outbreak becomes less severe. Read more about the symptoms of genital herpes. The herpes simplex virus (HSV) There are two types of herpes simplex virus (HSV), type 1 and type 2. Both types are highly contagious and can be passed easily from one person to another by direct contact. Genital herpes is usually transmitted by having sex (vaginal, anal or oral) with an infected person. Even if someone with genital herpes doesn't have any symptoms, it's possible for them to pass the condition on to a sexual partner. At least eight out of 10 people who carry the virus are unaware they have been infected because there are often few or no initial symptoms. However, certain triggers can activate the virus, causing an outbreak of genital herpes. Read more about the causes of genital herpes. Who is affected? Genital herpes is a common condition, especially in people from 20 to 24 years old. In 2013, 32,279 people attended a sexual health clinic in England with an attack of genital herpes for the first time. Read more about how genital herpes is diagnosed. Treating genital herpes Although there's no cure for genital herpes, the symptoms can usually be controlled using antiviral medicines. However, it's important to prevent the spread of genital herpes by avoiding sex until symptoms have cleared up and continuing to use a condom afterwards. Read more about how genital herpes is treated. Pregnancy Genital herpes can cause problems during pregnancy. These complications can be more serious depending on whether you already have genital herpes, or develop it for the first time while pregnant. Read more about complications of genital herpes.

Genital warts are very common. In England, they are the second most common type of sexually transmitted infection (STI) after chlamydia. Genital warts are the result of a viral skin infection caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). They are usually painless and do not pose a serious threat to health. But they can be unpleasant to look at and cause psychological distress. There is no evidence that your fertility will be affected by genital warts. Read more about the symptoms of genital warts. The human papilloma virus (HPV) The HPV is not a single virus, but a family of more than 100 different strains of viruses. Different strains usually affect different parts of the body, including the hands or feet. Although around 30 different types of HPV can affect the genital skin, most cases of infection with HPV cause no visible symptoms. Around 90% of all cases of genital warts are caused by two strains of the virus \u2013 type 6 and type 11. The types of HPV that cause visible genital warts do not cause genital cancer. Other strains of HPV can cause cervical cancer. How do they spread? Genital warts can be spread during vaginal or anal sex, and by sharing sex toys. But you don't need to have penetrative sex to pass the infection on because HPV is spread by skin-to-skin contact. Read more about the causes of genital warts. It can take months, or even years, for warts to develop after infection with HPV. So if you're in a relationship and you get genital warts, it does not necessarily mean your partner has been having sex with other people. HPV is most likely to be transmitted to others when warts are present, although it is still possible to pass the virus on before the warts have developed and after they have disappeared. Condoms do not provide complete protection because it is possible for the skin around your genital area not covered by the condom to become infected. Read more about preventing genital warts. Treating genital warts If you think you have genital warts, see a health professional as they may need to be treated. It is possible to have more than one STI at a time, so if you think you have warts, it is a good idea to have a check-up. You can make an appointment at your local sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic. You can go to a sexual health clinic whatever age you are. If you're under 16, the service is still confidential and the clinic won't tell your parents. Find your local sexual health or GUM clinic. The treatment for genital warts depends on how many warts you have and where they are. Several treatments are available, such as liquids or creams and freezing the warts (cryotherapy). You should not use wart creams that are available over the counter because they are designed to only treat warts on the hands or verrucas. If you are diagnosed with genital warts, it is recommended you do not have sex, including anal and oral sex, until your genital warts have fully healed. This will help prevent you passing the infection on to others. It will also help speed up your recovery. Learn more in treating genital warts. Will the warts come back? Some people only ever get one episode of genital warts. For many others, the warts will come back weeks, months or years later. If you do develop a new wart, it is not possible to say if these are a result of the original infection or a new infection with HPV. Who is affected? Both men and women can be affected by genital warts. According to Public Health England, in 2012 there were 73,893 new cases of genital warts diagnosed by GUM clinics in England. This compares with 206,912 new cases of chlamydia in 2012. Genital warts are most common in sexually active teenagers and young adults. The highest rates of genital warts occur in men aged 20 to 24 years and women aged 16 to 19 years. HPV vaccinations HPV vaccines in the UK are offered to all girls in year 8 (aged 12 to 13 years). Since September 2012, the vaccine Gardasil has been used and can help protect against HPV types 6 and 11, which cause around 90% of genital warts. It also protects against types 16 and 18, which are linked to more than 70% of cases of cervical cancer in the UK. Before September 2012, a different vaccine called Cervarix was used to protect against HPV types 16 and 18. HPV vaccines cannot protect against all types of HPV. If you are a woman and have received HPV vaccinations, you should still attend cervical screening (smear tests) as the vaccines do not guarantee that you will not develop cervical cancer in the future.

It used to be known as 'the clap'. The bacteria are mainly found in discharge from the penis and in vaginal fluid. Gonorrhoea is easily passed between people through: unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex sharing vibrators or other sex toys that haven't been washed or covered with a new condom each time they're used The bacteria can infect the cervix (entrance to the womb), the urethra (tube through which urine passes out of the body), the rectum, and less commonly the throat or eyes. The infection can also be passed from a pregnant woman to her baby. If you're pregnant and may have gonorrhoea, it's important to get tested and treated before your baby is born. Without treatment, gonorrhoea can cause permanent blindness in a newborn baby. Gonorrhoea isn't spread by kissing, hugging, sharing baths or towels, swimming pools, toilet seats, or sharing cups, plates and cutlery, because the bacteria can't survive outside the human body for long. Signs and symptoms Typical symptoms of gonorrhoea include a thick green or yellow discharge from the vagina or penis, pain when urinating and (in women) bleeding between periods. However, around 1 in 10 infected men and almost half of infected women don't experience any symptoms. Read more about the symptoms of gonorrhoea. Getting tested If you have any of the symptoms of gonorrhoea, or you're worried you may have an STI, you should visit your local genitourinary medicine (GUM) or sexual health clinic for a sexual health test. Gonorrhoea can be easily diagnosed by testing a sample of discharge picked up using a swab. Testing a sample of urine can also be used to diagnose the condition in men. It's important to get tested as soon as possible, because gonorrhoea can lead to more serious long-term health problems if it's not treated, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women, or infertility. You can find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching by postcode or town. For information on all sexual health services, visit the FPA website. Read more about diagnosing gonorrhoea and the possible complications of gonorrhoea. Treating gonorrhoea Gonorrhoea is usually treated with a single antibiotic injection and a single antibiotic tablet. With effective treatment, most of your symptoms should improve within a few days. It's usually recommended that you attend a follow-up appointment a week or two after treatment, so another test can be carried out to see if you're clear of infection. You should avoid having sex until you've been given the all-clear. Read more about how gonorrhoea is treated. Who's affected? Anyone who's sexually active can catch gonorrhoea, especially people who change partners frequently or don't use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, when having sex. Gonorrhoea is the second most common bacterial STI in the UK after chlamydia. Almost 35,000 cases were reported in England during 2014, with most cases affecting young men and women under the age of 25. Previous successful treatment for gonorrhoea doesn't make you immune to catching the infection again. Preventing gonorrhoea Gonorrhoea and other STIs can be successfully prevented by using appropriate contraception and taking other precautions, such as: using male condoms or female condoms every time you have vaginal sex, or male condoms during anal sex using a condom to cover the penis, or a latex or plastic square (dam) to cover the female genitals, if you have oral sex not sharing sex toys, or washing them and covering them with a new condom before anyone else uses them If you're worried you may have an STI, visit your local GUM or sexual health clinic for advice.

It is usually caused by an infection. The term non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) is used when the condition is not caused by gonorrhoea \u2013 a sexually transmitted infection (STI). NGU is sometimes referred to as non-specific urethritis (NSU) when no cause can be found. In women, NGU rarely has any symptoms. Symptoms in men include: a painful or burning sensation when urinating the tip of the penis feeling irritated and sore a white or cloudy discharge from the tip of the penis Read more about the symptoms of NGU. If you think you have NGU, you should visit your local genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic or sexual health clinic. These clinics have access to specialist diagnostic equipment that your GP may not have. It is easy to find sexual health services in your area. Sexual health services are free and available to everyone, regardless of age, sex, ethnic origin and sexual orientation. Why does NGU happen? NGU can have a number of possible causes, including irritation to the urethra and STIs. Chlamydia causes up to 43 out of 100 cases of NGU. There are many cases of NGU where no infection is found. If no cause is found, you will still be offered treatment for possible infection. This is also the case if inflammation is caused by an object such as a catheter in the urethra, or by using creams and soaps around the genitals. Read more about the causes of NGU. Who is affected? Urethritis is the most common condition diagnosed and treated among men in GUM clinics or sexual health clinics in the UK. There are around 80,000 men diagnosed with urethritis every year. It is more difficult to diagnose urethritis in women because it may not cause as many symptoms. NGU is usually diagnosed after urine and swab tests. Read more about diagnosing NGU. Treating NGU Antibiotics are usually prescribed to treat NGU. You may be given them before you get your test results. Antibiotics are also used in cases where NGU is thought to have been caused by an object, cream or soap. In most cases, only a short course of treatment is needed and symptoms clear up after about two weeks. The most common antibiotics used are azithromycin and doxycycline (Vibramycin-D). It is important that past and current sexual partners are also treated, to prevent any infection spreading to others. After treatment has been completed, and symptoms have disappeared, it should be safe to start having sex again. Read more about treating NGU. Preventing NGU As NGU is usually caused by an STI, practising safer sex is the best way to reduce the chances of it developing. Safer sex involves using barrier contraception, such as condoms, and having regular checks at sexual health clinics or GUMs. Read more about preventing NGU. Complications NGU can have some complications \u2013 for example, the condition can keep coming back. Other complications include: reactive arthritis \u2013 when the immune system starts attacking healthy tissue, which can lead to joint pain and conjunctivitis epididymo-orchitis \u2013 inflammation of the testicles Women often have no symptoms of NGU. However, if it's caused by chlamydia and left untreated, it can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Repeated episodes of PID are associated with an increased risk of infertility.

As well as being found in pubic hair, the lice are also sometimes found in: underarm and leg hair hair on the chest, abdomen and back facial hair, such as beards and moustaches eyelashes and eyebrows (very occasionally) Unlike head lice, pubic lice don't live in scalp hair. Pubic lice are spread through close bodily contact, most commonly sexual contact. Symptoms of pubic lice After getting pubic lice, it can take several weeks before any symptoms appear. Symptoms are the same for men and women and include: itching in the affected areas inflammation and irritation caused by scratching black powder in your underwear blue spots or small spots of blood on your skin, such as on your thighs or lower abdomen (caused by lice bites) Itching is the most common symptom of pubic lice and is an allergic reaction to their saliva. The itching is usually worse at night, when the lice are most active. What do pubic lice look like? Adult pubic lice are very small (2mm long) and aren't easy to see. They're a yellow-grey or dusky red colour and have six legs. Pubic lice are sometimes known as crabs because they have two large front legs that look like the claws of a crab. These are used to hold onto the base of hairs. The lice lay their eggs (nits) in sacs that are stuck firmly to hairs and are a pale brownish colour. When the eggs hatch, the empty egg sacs are white. Although pubic lice and lice eggs are small and difficult to see, they may be visible in coarse hair anywhere on your body (apart from hair on your head). When to seek medical advice See your GP or practice nurse if you think you have pubic lice. Alternatively, you could go to a sexual health clinic, also known as a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic. These are often located in hospitals or health centres. Search for sexual health services in your area. Pubic lice are usually easy to diagnose by examining the affected area. The doctor or nurse may use a magnifying glass to look for signs of the lice, such as pale-coloured eggs or the lice themselves. Getting tested for STIs You should be tested for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) if you have pubic lice through sexual contact. The lice don't transmit HIV or other STIs, but a check-up is usually recommended as a precaution.  Any sexual partners you've had over the last three months will also need to be seen and treated. If you prefer, staff at the clinic can contact a person on your behalf without releasing your details. How do you get pubic lice? Pubic lice aren't related to poor personal hygiene. They're usually spread through close bodily contact with an infected person. The lice crawl from hair to hair, but can't fly or jump. They need human blood to survive, so will only leave the body to move from one person to another. The most common way pubic lice are spread is through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal and oral sex. Using condoms and other methods of barrier contraception doesn't protect you against pubic lice. Other types of close bodily contact, such as hugging and kissing, can also spread the lice. It's also possible \u2013 though much rarer \u2013 for pubic lice to be spread through sharing clothes, towels and bedding.  Treating pubic lice Pubic lice can be treated at home with insecticide cream, lotion or shampoo. Your GP or pharmacist can advise you about which treatment to use and how to use it. It's important to follow this advice. Some treatments only need to be applied to the affected area, but sometimes the whole body must be treated, taking care to avoid the eyes. The treatment usually needs to be repeated after three to seven days. If the treatment doesn't work, you may need to use another type. This is because pubic lice can develop resistance to some treatments. Your GP or pharmacist will be able to advise you about suitable alternatives. To prevent re-infestation, anyone you've had close bodily contact with, including any sexual partners you've had in the past three months, should also be treated, even if they don't have symptoms. Certain groups, such as young people under 18 years of age and pregnant or breastfeeding women, may require a specific type of treatment. Ask your GP or pharmacist for further advice about this. Applying a lotion, cream or shampoo In most cases the instructions for using a lotion, cream or shampoo will be as follows: apply the product to the affected area, particularly any hairy areas, such as your eyebrows, beard or moustache \u2013 depending on the product, you might need to apply it to your whole body, including the scalp, neck, ears and face be careful not to get the product in your eyes \u2013 if you do, rinse your eyes thoroughly with water reapply the treatment if you wash any part of your body during the treatment time after the treatment time (stated on the packet) has passed, wash the lotion or cream off repeat the treatment after three to seven days as instructed Don't use the medication more than twice. If you think it hasn't worked go to see your GP or pharmacist for advice. Side effects Insecticides used to treat pubic lice may cause skin irritation, such as itchiness, redness, stinging or burning. If you have skin irritation, wash the insecticide off the affected area. Some aqueous and alcohol-based medications may discolour permed, coloured or bleached hair. Check the patient information leaflet. Follow-up treatment The first treatment application will probably kill the lice, but the eggs may not have been destroyed. This means more lice could hatch and the cycle will start again. Reapplying the treatment after three or seven days will ensure that any lice are killed before they're old enough to lay more eggs. Check for lice a week after your second treatment, or return to your GP, practice nurse, or sexual health clinic so they can check for you. Finding empty eggshells (dead nits) doesn't necessarily mean you're still infested as they can remain stuck to the hairs even after treatment. Treating an eyelash infestation Eyelash infestations are rare. If your eyelashes are infested, seek specialist advice from your doctor. They'll be able to recommend the correct treatment for you.  You can't use the same insecticide lotion or cream that's used on your body because it will irritate your eyes. Make sure you follow the treatment instructions carefully. Washing clothing, towels and bedding Wash clothing, towels and bedding in a washing machine. This should be on a hot cycle (50C or higher) to ensure the lice are killed and to prevent reinfection. Complications of pubic lice Sometimes, a pubic lice infestation can lead to minor complications, such as skin or eye problems. Scratching can irritate your skin, or it could lead to an infection such as impetigo (a bacterial skin infection) or furunculosis (boils on the skin). Eye infections, such as conjunctivitis, and eye inflammation, such as blepharitis, can sometimes develop if your eyelashes have been infested with pubic lice. Seek medical advice if you have severe skin irritation or sore eyes. Sexual health advice You can call the Department of Health's sexual health helpline on 0300 123 7123 for confidential advice and support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If you're under 25, you can also contact an advisor at Brook using their text and webchat service. They provide free and confidential information and advice about STIs, contraception, pregnancy, plus other sexual health matters.

The main symptom of scabies is intense itching that's worse at night. It also causes a skin rash on areas where the mites have burrowed. Read more about the symptoms of scabies. Scabies mites Scabies mites are called Sarcoptes scabiei. They feed using their mouths and front legs to burrow into the outer layer of skin (epidermis), where they lay eggs. After three to four days, the baby mites (larvae) hatch and move to the surface of the skin, where they mature into adults. Scabies like warm places, such as skin folds, between the fingers, under fingernails, or around the buttock or breast creases. They can also hide under watch straps, bracelets or rings. Read more about the life cycle of the scabies mite. How scabies is spread Scabies is usually spread through prolonged periods of skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, or through sexual contact. It's also possible \u2013 but rare \u2013 for scabies to be passed on by sharing clothing, towels and bedding with someone who's infected. It can take up to eight weeks for the symptoms of scabies to appear after the initial infection. This is known as the incubation period. Read more about the causes of scabies. Scabies outbreaks Scabies is widespread in densely populated areas with limited access to medical care, and is most common in the following tropical and subtropical areas: Africa Central and South America northern and central Australia Caribbean Islands India southeast Asia In developed countries, scabies outbreaks can sometimes occur in places where there are lots of people, such as schools, nurseries and care homes. In the UK, most outbreaks of scabies occur in the winter. This may be because people tend to spend more time indoors and closer to each other at this time of year. It's difficult to know exactly how many cases of scabies there are in the UK. This is because many people don't visit their GP and treat the condition with non-prescription medicines. Treating scabies Visit your GP if you think you have scabies. It's not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated. The two most widely used treatments for scabies are permethrin cream and malathion lotion (brand name Derbac M). Both medications contain insecticides that kill the scabies mite. Permethrin 5% cream is usually recommended as the first treatment. Malathion 0.5% lotion is used if permethrin is ineffective. If your partner has been diagnosed with genital scabies, to avoid reinfection you should visit your nearest sexual health clinic so you can be checked and, if necessary, treated. Avoid having sex and other forms of close bodily contact until both you and your partner have completed the full course of treatment. Read more about diagnosing scabies and treating scabies. Complications of scabies Scabies can sometimes lead to a secondary skin infection if your skin becomes irritated and inflamed through excessive itching. Crusted scabies is a rare but more severe form of scabies, where a large number of mites are in the skin. This can develop in older people and those with a lowered immunity.

It's important to get tested and treated as soon as possible if you think you might have syphilis, as it can cause serious problems if it's left untreated. It can usually be cured with a short course of antibiotics. You can catch syphilis more than once, even if you've been treated for it before. This page covers: Symptoms of syphilis What to do if you think you have syphilis Treatments for syphilis How syphilis is spread Preventing syphilis Syphilis in pregnancy Symptoms of syphilis The symptoms of syphilis aren't always obvious and may eventually disappear, but you'll usually remain infected unless you get treated. Some people with syphilis have no symptoms. Symptoms can include: small, painless sores or ulcers that typically appear on the penis, vagina, or around the anus, but can occur in other places such as the mouth  a blotchy red rash that often affects the palms of the hands or soles of the feet small skin growths (similar to genital warts) that may develop on the vulva in women or around the anus in both men and women white patches in the mouth tiredness, headaches, joint pains, a high temperature (fever), and swollen glands in your neck, groin or armpits If it's left untreated for years, syphilis can spread to the brain or other parts of the body and cause serious, long-term problems. Read more about the symptoms of syphilis. What to do if you think you have syphilis You should get tested as soon as possible if you're worried you could have syphilis, because: syphilis won't normally go away on its own getting tested is the only way to find out if you have it the medicines used to treat syphilis are only available on prescription \u2013 you can't buy them yourself treatment can help reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others and of serious problems developing later on The best place to get tested is your nearest genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic or sexual health clinic. The test for syphilis usually involves a blood test and removing a sample of fluid from any sores using a swab (similar to a cotton bud). Read more about testing for syphilis. Treatments for syphilis Syphilis is usually treated with either: an injection of antibiotics into your buttocks \u2013 most people will only need one dose, although three injections given at weekly intervals may be recommended if you've had syphilis for a long time a course of antibiotics tablets if you can't have the injection \u2013 this will usually last two or four weeks, depending on how long you've had syphilis  You should avoid any kind of sexual activity or close sexual contact with another person until at least two weeks after your treatment finishes. Read more about treating syphilis. How syphilis is spread Syphilis is mainly spread through close contact with an infected sore. This usually happens during vaginal, anal or oral sex, or by sharing sex toys with someone who's infected. Anyone who's sexually active is potentially at risk. Pregnant women with syphilis can also pass the infection to their unborn baby. Read more about Syphilis in pregnancy below. It may be possible to catch syphilis if you're an injecting drug user and you share needles with somebody who's infected, or through blood transfusions (this is very rare in the UK as all blood donations are tested for syphilis). Syphilis can't be spread by using the same toilet, clothing, cutlery or bathroom as an infected person. Preventing syphilis Syphilis can't always be prevented, but if you're sexually active you can reduce your risk by practising safer sex: use a male condom or female condom during vaginal, oral and anal sex use a dental dam (a square of plastic) during oral sex avoid sharing sex toys \u2013 if you do share them, wash them and cover them with a condom before each use These measures can also reduce your risk of catching other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If you're an injecting drug user, don't use other people's needles or share your needles with others. Syphilis in pregnancy If a woman becomes infected while she's pregnant, or becomes pregnant when she already has syphilis, it can be very dangerous for her baby if not treated. Infection in pregnancy can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or a serious infection in the baby (congenital syphilis). Screening for syphilis during pregnancy is offered to all pregnant women so the infection can be detected and treated before it causes any serious problems.

Symptoms of trichomoniasis usually develop within a month of infection, although up to half of all infected men and women have no symptoms. The symptoms of trichomoniasis are similar to those of many other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) so it can sometimes be difficult to diagnose. Symptoms in women Trichomoniasis in women can cause any of the following symptoms: abnormal vaginal discharge that may be thick, thin or frothy and yellow-green in colour producing more discharge than normal, which may also have an unpleasant fishy smell soreness, inflammation (swelling) and itching around the vagina \u2013 sometimes the inner thighs also become itchy pain or discomfort when passing urine or having sex Symptoms in men Trichomoniasis in men can cause any of the following symptoms: pain during urination or ejaculation needing to urinate more frequently than usual  thin white discharge from the penis soreness, swelling and redness around the head of the penis (balanitis) or foreskin (balano-posthitis) When to seek medical advice Visit your GP or local genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic if you develop any of the symptoms of trichomoniasis or if you think you may be infected. Trichomoniasis can usually be diagnosed after an examination of the genitals and a laboratory test carried out on a swab taken from the vagina or penis. If the test shows you have trichomoniasis, it's important that your current sexual partner and any other recent partners are also tested and treated. Read more about diagnosing trichomoniasis. How do you get trichomoniasis? Trichomoniasis is caused by a tiny parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis.   In women, this parasite mainly infects the vagina and urethra (tube that carries urine out of the body). In men, the infection most commonly affects the urethra, but the head of the penis or prostate gland (a gland near the bladder that helps produce semen) can become infected in some cases. The parasite is usually spread by having unprotected sex (sex without a condom). It could also be spread by sharing sex toys if you don't wash them or cover them with a new condom before use. You don't have to have many sexual partners to catch trichomoniasis. Anyone who is sexually active can catch it and pass it on. Trichomoniasis isn't thought to be passed on through: oral or anal sex kissing or hugging sharing cups, plates or cutlery toilet seats The best way to prevent trichomoniasis is to have safer sex. This means always using a condom when having sex, covering any sex toys you use with a condom, and washing sex toys after use. Read more about preventing trichomoniasis. Treating trichomoniasis Trichomoniasis is unlikely to go away without treatment, but it can be effectively treated with antibiotics. Most men and women are treated with an antibiotic called metronidazole, which is usually taken twice a day for five to seven days. It's important to complete the whole course of antibiotics and avoid having sex until the infection clears up, to prevent reinfection. Your current sexual partner and any other recent partners should also be treated. Read more about treating trichomoniasis. Complications of trichomoniasis Complications of trichomoniasis are rare, although some women with the infection may be at an increased risk of further problems. If you're infected with trichomoniasis while you're pregnant, the infection may cause your baby to be either:  born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) have a low birth weight Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 08\/12\/2015 Next review due: 08\/12\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Most infections can be cured. A sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic specialises in sexual health, and can provide tests and treatment for many STIs. Visiting an STI clinic You can make an appointment to go to an STI clinic, or sometimes there's a drop-in clinic, which means you can just turn up without the need for an appointment. You might feel embarrassed, but there's no need \u2013 the staff at these clinics are used to testing for all kinds of infections. It's their job and they won't judge you. They should do their best to explain everything to you and make you feel at ease. You can go to a sexual health clinic whether you're male or female, whatever your age, regardless of whether or not you have STI symptoms. If you're under 16, the service is still confidential and the clinic won't tell your parents. If they suspect you or another young person is at risk of harm, they might need to tell other healthcare services, but they will talk to you before they do this.  Find sexual health services near you, including sexual health and GUM clinics. Your name and details When you go to a sexual health clinic, you'll be asked for your name and some contact details. You don't have to give your real name if you don't want to. If you do, it will be kept confidential. Your GP won't be told about your visit without your permission. If you have tests and the results aren't available during your visit, the clinic will need to contact you later, so give them the correct contact details. The clinic will ask how you want to receive your results. They can usually be given to you over the phone, by text, or in an unmarked letter. Answering some questions You will see a doctor or a nurse, who will ask you about your medical and sexual history. Be prepared to answer questions about your sex life, including: when you last had sex whether you've had unprotected sex whether you have any symptoms why you think you might have an infection You can ask to see a female or male doctor or nurse if you prefer, but you might have to wait longer than usual for one to become available.  Having STI tests The doctor or nurse will tell you what tests they think you need. They should explain what is going on and why they are suggesting these tests. If you're not sure about anything, ask them to explain. The tests might involve: a urine (pee) sample a blood sample swabs from the urethra (the tube urine comes out of) an examination of your genitals if you're female, swabs from the vagina, which you can usually do yourself Testing for chlamydia and gonorrhoea usually requires only a urine sample or a self-taken swab for a woman. Testing for HIV and syphilis needs a blood sample. Tests for herpes aren't usually done unless you have sores on your genitals or anus. In this case, a swab will be taken from a sore. This will be uncomfortable for a moment. Find out more about: chlamydia testing  herpes testing syphilis testing gonorrhoea testing HIV testing Getting your test results With some tests, you can get the results \u2013 and treatment, if you need it \u2013 on the same day. For others, you might have to wait for a week or two. If this is the case, the clinic will check how you would prefer to receive your results. If you test positive for an STI, you will be asked to go back to the clinic to talk about your results and the treatment you need. Many STIs can be cured with antibiotics. Some infections, such as HIV, have no cure, but there are treatments available. The clinic can advise you on these and put you in touch with a counsellor. If possible, tell your sexual partner and any ex-partners so they can get tested and treated as well. If you don't want to do this, the clinic can usually do it for you \u2013 it's called partner notification and the clinic won't reveal who you are. Using condoms to protect against STIs The best way to protect yourself from getting or passing on an infection is to use a condom every time you have sex. The clinic can give you some condoms so you can practice safer sex. Always buy condoms that have the CE mark or BSI kite mark on the packet. This means they've been tested to high safety standards. Condoms that don't have the CE mark or BSI kite mark won't meet these standards, so don't use them. Get tips on using condoms properly. Bear in mind that having had an STI once doesn't make you immune to it \u2013 you can get the same infection again.  Other places to go for help Sexual health and GUM clinics have the greatest expertise in testing and treatments for STIs, but you can also go to: your GP a young people's sexual health service \u2013 call the national sexual health line on 0300 123 7123 a community contraception clinic  a pharmacy They may be able to offer tests for some infections and advise you on where to go for further help.  Further information Does anal sex have any health risks?

Other symptoms of dysentery can include: painful stomach cramps nausea or vomiting a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above, or 37.5C (99.5F) or above in children under five In the UK, most people with dysentery only experience mild symptoms. It's not always necessary to see a GP, as it tends to clear up within a week or so. See your GP if your symptoms are severe or don't start to improve after a few days. Tell them if you have recently been abroad. Treating dysentery Treatment isn't normally needed, as it usually clears up on its own. However, it's important to make sure you drink plenty of fluids and use oral rehydration solutions (ORS) if necessary, to avoid dehydration. See treating diarrhoea for more information on this. Over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol can help to relieve pain and a fever. It's best to avoid antidiarrhoeal medications such as loperamide, as they can make things worse. You should stay at home until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea, to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to others. If your symptoms are severe or persistent, your GP may prescribe a short course of antibiotics. In severe cases, you may need to be treated in hospital for a few days. What causes dysentery? There are two main types of dysentery: bacillary dysentery or shigellosis \u2013 caused by shigella bacteria; this is the most common type of dysentery in the UK amoebic dysentery or amoebiasis \u2013 caused by an amoeba (single-celled parasite) called Entamoeba histolytica, that's found mainly in tropical areas; this type of dysentery is usually picked up abroad Both types of dysentery are highly infectious and can be passed on if the poo of an infected person gets into another person's mouth. This can happen if someone with the infection doesn't wash their hands after going to the toilet and then touches food, surfaces, or another person. In the UK, the infection usually affects groups of people in close contact, such as families, schools and nurseries. There is also a chance of picking up the infection through anal or anal-oral sex (\"rimming\"). In developing countries with poor sanitation, infected poo may contaminate the water supply or food (particularly cold, uncooked food). Preventing dysentery You can reduce your risk of getting dysentery with good hygiene.

The shin pain can be felt during or after strenuous activity, particularly running, or sports with sudden stops and starts, such as basketball and tennis. The pain is felt along the shin bone (tibia), which runs down the inner part of your shin. At first you will feel a dull, aching pain. If you ignore it and continue to exercise, it can become very painful and you may have to stop exercising altogether. It's really important not to \"run through the pain\" because shin pain could be a sign of an injury to the bone and surrounding tissues in your leg. Continued force on your legs will make the injury and your pain worse. If possible, stop doing the activity which causes the problem for at least two weeks. You can still exercise during this time, but choose activities that don't put too much force on your shins, such as cycling, swimming, cross-training or yoga. Why shin splints happen Shin splints have a number of different causes. You're at risk of getting shin splints if you: have been running for less than five years run on hard surfaces or slopes wear poorly fitting or worn-out trainers that don't cushion and support your feet properly are overweight, as this places extra stress on your legs have flat feet or your feet roll inwards, as this puts more pressure on your lower legs have weak ankles or a tight Achilles tendon (the band of tissue connecting the heel bone to the calf muscle) have tight calf muscles Medial stress syndrome The most common cause of shin splints is medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS). MTSS is the result of frequent and intense periods of exercise when your body isn't used to it. Long-distance running and sports involving a lot of stopping and starting, such as basketball and tennis, increase your risk of getting MTSS. Suddenly increasing the distance and\/or pace you run are also common causes. These activities place a considerable amount of pressure on your legs, particularly if they are carried out on hard ground, and can cause injury to the bone and surrounding tissues. MTSS is thought to occur when the layer of connective tissue covering the surface of the shin bone (periosteum) becomes inflamed. It can become inflamed if too much pressure is placed on your shins, or if your foot rolls excessively when it hits the ground. This is known as over-pronation and it puts abnormal forces through the tibia and the shin bone. The pain is usually felt in both shins and it can take several days, or even weeks, for the pain to decrease once you stop the activity. Self care You should stop the activity causing your shin splints for at least two weeks. After this time, the pain in your shins should begin to decrease and you can gradually resume the activity (see below). While you're resting your legs, you can continue to do low impact activities, such as cross-training, cycling or swimming. Pool running is also a good way of maintaining cardiovascular fitness. Pain relief Pain and swelling can be relieved by holding an ice pack against your shins (a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel works well). Do this for 10 minutes every two to three hours for the first two days. You can also use over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, to help relieve the pain and inflammation. Stretching your calf muscles and the front of your leg can also help. Choosing the right shoes It's important your running shoes give you the right amount of cushioning and support for your weight and foot type. If your foot rolls inwards, you may need to have orthotics (rigid shoe inserts) fitted. Go to a specialist running shop if you are buying running shoes for the first time. A trained member of staff will be able to carry out a number of tests, including a gait analysis, and advise which shoes are best for you. If you continue having problems with your shoes, a podiatrist can give a more expert opinion and look at your overall lower limb biomechanics. Podiatrists specialise in diagnosing and treating foot problems. Find a podiatrist in your area. When to visit your GP See your GP if the pain does not improve. They will investigate other possible causes, such as: reduced blood supply to the lower leg, particularly if you smoke  tiny cracks in the shin bone (stress fractures), which usually, but not always, give pain in only one leg a leg muscle bulging out of place (muscle hernia) swelling of the leg muscle that compresses nearby nerves and blood vessels, known as compartment syndrome (see below)  a nerve problem in your lower back (radiculopathy) The pain of compartment syndrome is usually felt in both legs and only comes on with exercise. It can be felt in the front, side or back of the leg and, sometimes, in all three. Unlike the pain of MTSS, the pain caused by compartment syndrome quickly subsides when exercise ceases. Seek immediate medical assistance if: the pain is severe and follows a fall or accident your shins are hot and inflamed the swelling gets worse the pain persists during rest Your GP may refer you for physiotherapy, or you may be able to refer yourself. You could also opt to see a physiotherapist privately. Read more about accessing physiotherapy. The physiotherapist can assess your injury, show you some exercises and advise a suitable programme of rehabilitation. Alternatively, your GP may refer you to a consultant orthopaedic surgeon with a foot and ankle interest, or a consultant in sport and exercise medicine. These doctors are trained in assessing and treating sport-related problems. Getting back to your normal exercise programme You can return to your usual activity after at least two weeks of rest, and only after the pain has gone. Increase your activity level gradually, building up the time you spend running or doing sports. Run on a flat, soft surface, such as a recreation ground or playing field. Keep the distance and intensity of your run to 50% of what it was before the injury. Stop immediately if the pain returns. Gradually, over a period of three to six weeks, you can increase the distance you run. After six weeks, you can gradually start to increase your pace. Make sure you warm up properly before starting to exercise and, afterwards, take time to cool down. Learn how to warm up before exercising and how to stretch after exercising. Preventing shin splints returning You can avoid shin splints in the future by: wearing running shoes with the correct level of cushioning and support using orthotics (supportive insoles) if you over-pronate or have flat feet (running shop staff or a podiatrist will be able to advise you further about this) avoid training on hard surfaces whenever possible build up your activity level gradually improving your overall strength and flexibility Page last reviewed: 16\/12\/2014 Next review due: 16\/12\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which also causes chickenpox. It's estimated around one in every four people will have at least one episode of shingles during their life. This topic covers: Symptoms of shingles When to seek medical advice Causes of shingles Is shingles contagious? Treating shingles Complications of shingles The shingles vaccine Ophthalmic shingles Symptoms of shingles The main symptom of shingles is pain, followed by a rash that develops into itchy blisters, similar in appearance to chickenpox.  New blisters may appear for up to a week, but a few days after appearing they become yellowish in colour, flatten and dry out. Scabs then form where the blisters were, which may leave some slight scarring and loss of skin pigment. The pain may be a constant, dull or burning sensation, and its intensity can vary from mild to severe.  You may have sharp stabbing pains from time to time, and the affected area of skin will usually be tender. In some cases shingles may cause some early symptoms that develop a few days before the painful rash first appears. These early symptoms can include: a headache burning, tingling, numbness or itchiness of the skin in the affected area a feeling of being generally unwell a high temperature (fever) An episode of shingles typically lasts around two to four weeks. It usually affects a specific area on just one side of the body. It doesn't cross over the midline of the body, an imaginary line running from between your eyes down past the belly button. Any part of your body can be affected, including your face and eyes, but the chest and tummy (abdomen) are the most common areas. When to seek medical advice Shingles isn't usually serious, but see your GP as soon as possible if you recognise the symptoms. They'll usually be able to diagnose shingles based on your symptoms and the appearance of the rash. Early treatment may help reduce the severity of your symptoms and the risk of developing complications. Referral to hospital It's uncommon for someone with shingles to be referred to hospital, but your GP may consider seeking specialist advice if: they suspect a complication of shingles, such as meningitis or encephalitis shingles is affecting one of your eyes \u2013 there's a risk you could develop permanent vision problems if the condition isn't treated quickly a diagnosis isn't certain you have an unusually persistent case of shingles that's not responding to treatment you've been diagnosed with the condition twice you're pregnant you have a weakened immune system \u2013 particularly in severe cases or cases affecting children Causes of shingles Most people have chickenpox in childhood, but after the illness has gone the varicella-zoster virus remains inactive (dormant) in the nervous system. The immune system keeps the virus in check, but it can be reactivated later in life and cause shingles. It's possible to have shingles more than once, but it's very rare to get it more than twice.  It's not known exactly why the shingles virus is reactivated at a later stage in life, but most cases are thought to be caused by having lowered protection against infections and diseases (immunity). This may be the result of: old age \u2013 as you age, your immunity may decrease; shingles most commonly occurs in people over the age of 70 physical and emotional stress \u2013 the chemicals released by your body when you're stressed can prevent your immune system working properly HIV and AIDS \u2013 people with HIV are much more likely to get shingles than the rest of the population because their immune system is weak recently having a bone marrow transplant \u2013 the conditioning you require before the transplant weakens your immune system recently having an organ transplant \u2013 you may need to take medication to suppress your immune system so your body accepts the donated organ chemotherapy \u2013 chemotherapy medication, often used to treat cancer, can temporarily weaken your immune system However, young people who are otherwise healthy can also sometimes develop shingles. Is shingles contagious? It's not possible to catch shingles from someone with the condition or from someone with chickenpox. However, you can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles if you haven't had chickenpox before. The blisters of shingles contain live virus. If a person who has never had chickenpox makes direct contact with an open blister or something with the fluid on it, they can contract the virus and develop chickenpox. Preventing the spread of the virus If you have shingles, you're contagious until the last blister has dried and scabbed over. To help prevent the virus being passed on, avoid sharing towels or flannels, swimming or playing contact sports. You should also avoid work or school if your rash is oozing fluid (weeping) and can't be covered. Chickenpox can be particularly dangerous for certain groups of people. If you have shingles, avoid: women who are pregnant and haven't had chickenpox before as they could catch it from you \u2013 this may harm their unborn baby people who have a weak immune system \u2013 such as someone with HIV or AIDS babies less than one month old \u2013 unless it's your own baby, in which case your baby should have proteins that fight infection (antibodies) to protect them from the virus Treating shingles Although there's no cure for shingles, treatment is available to relieve the symptoms until the condition resolves. Most cases of shingles last around two to four weeks. Treatment for shingles can include: covering the rash with clothing or a non-stick (non-adherent) dressing to reduce the risk of other people becoming infected with chickenpox \u2013 it's very difficult to pass the virus on to someone else if the rash is covered painkilling medication \u2013 such as paracetamol, ibuprofen or codeine antiviral medication to stop the virus multiplying \u2013 although not everyone will need this Read more about treating shingles. Complications of shingles Shingles can sometimes lead to complications, such as postherpetic neuralgia. This is where severe nerve pain lasts for several months or more after the rash has gone. Complications like this are usually in elderly people who have had the condition and those with a weakened immune system. Read more about complications of shingles. The shingles vaccine It's not always possible to prevent shingles, but a vaccine called Zostavax can reduce your chances of developing the condition. If you still develop shingles after having this vaccine, it may be milder and last for a shorter time than usual. This vaccine is now routinely offered on the NHS as a single injection to people aged 70 and 78. Check with your GP if you're eligible to receive it. Read about: Shingles vaccination Who can have the shingles vaccine Ophthalmic shingles Some cases of shingles can affect one of the eyes and are known as ophthalmic shingles. This occurs when the virus is reactivated in part of the trigeminal nerve, a nerve that controls sensation and movement in your face. Symptoms can include: a rash over your forehead, nose and around your eye conjunctivitis \u2013 inflammation of your eye that causes it to become red and watery, with a sticky coating on your eyelashes a red eye problems with your vision Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 08\/07\/2016 Next review due: 08\/07\/2019 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The shingles vaccine is given as a single injection into the upper arm. Unlike the flu jab, you'll only need to have the vaccination once and you can have it at any time of the year. The shingles vaccine is expected to reduce your risk of getting shingles. If you are unlucky enough to go on to have the disease, your symptoms may be milder and the illness shorter. Shingles can be very painful and uncomfortable. Some people are left with pain lasting for years after the initial rash has healed. And shingles is fatal for around 1 in 1,000 over-70s who develop it. It's fine to have the shingles vaccine if you've already had shingles. The shingles vaccine works very well in people who have had shingles before and it will boost your immunity against further shingles attacks. Who can have the shingles vaccination? From September 1 2016 the shingles vaccine is routinely available to people aged 70 and 78. You become eligible for the vaccine on the first day of September 2016 after you've turned 70 or 78 and remain so until the last day of August 2017. In addition, anyone who was eligible for immunisation in the previous three years of the programme but missed out on their shingles vaccination remains eligible until their 80th birthday. This includes: people aged 71, 72 and 73 on 1 September 2016 people aged 79 on 1 September 2016  The shingles vaccine is not available on the NHS if you are aged 80 or over. Until 31 August 2016, the shingles vaccine is still available to all those who were aged 70 or 78 on 1 September 2015. You can have the shingles vaccination at any time of year, though many people will find it convenient to have it at the same time as their annual flu vaccination. Find out more about who is eligible for shingles vaccination. How do I get the shingles vaccine? You don't need to do anything. Your doctor will invite you to the surgery for the vaccine when you become eligible. If you can't go to the appointment you're offered, contact your GP practice to rearrange it. It\u2019s important that you don't leave it too late to have the vaccination, as your GP may only be able to give it to you before 31 August 2017. What is the brand name of the shingles vaccine? The brand name of the shingles vaccine given in the UK is Zostavax. It can be given at any time of the year. Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for Zostavax. How does the shingles vaccine work? The vaccine contains a weakened chickenpox virus (varicella-zoster virus). It's similar, but not identical to, the chickenpox vaccine. Very occasionally, people have developed a chickenpox-like illness following shingles vaccination (fewer than 1 in 10,000 individuals). How long will the shingles vaccine protect me for? It's difficult to be precise, but research suggests the shingles vaccine will protect you for at least five years, probably longer. How safe is the shingles vaccine? There is lots of evidence showing that the shingles vaccine is very safe. It's already been used in several countries, including the US and Canada, and no safety concerns have been raised. The vaccine also has few side effects. Read more about shingles vaccine side effects. What is shingles? Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a painful skin rash caused by the reactivation of the chickenpox virus (varicella-zoster virus) in people who have previously had chickenpox. It begins with a burning sensation in the skin, followed by a rash of very painful fluid-filled blisters that can then burst and turn into sores before healing. Often an area on just one side of the body is affected, usually the chest but sometimes the head, face and eye. Read more about the symptoms of shingles. How is shingles spread? You don't \"catch\" shingles \u2013 it comes on when there's a reawakening of chickenpox virus that's already in your body. The virus can be reactivated because of advancing age, medication, illness or stress and so on. Anyone who has had chickenpox can get shingles. It's estimated that around one in five people who have had chickenpox go on to develop shingles. Read more about the causes of shingles. Who's most at risk of shingles? People tend to get shingles more often as they get older, especially over the age of  70. And the older you are, the worse it can be. The shingles rash can be extremely painful, such that sufferers can't even bear the feeling of their clothes touching the affected skin. The pain of shingles can also linger long after the rash has disappeared, even for many years. This lingering pain is called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Read more about the complications of shingles. There's more information about shingles vaccination in this NHS leaflet. Read the answers to some of the common questions about the shingles vaccine.

There are two main types of restricted growth: proportionate short stature (PSS) \u2013 a general lack of growth, where the length of the trunk and limbs are in proportion disproportionate short stature (DSS) \u2013 where the limbs are shorter or out of proportion with other parts of the body As well as having short stature, some people with restricted growth also have other physical problems, such as bowed legs or an unusually curved spine. However, most people don't have any other serious problems. They can often live a relatively normal life and have a normal life expectancy. Read more about the symptoms of restricted growth. What causes restricted growth? The most common cause of PSS is being born to small parents, but it can sometimes occur as a result of the body not producing enough growth hormone. Certain genetic syndromes, such as Turner syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome, can also cause PSS. DSS usually occurs as part of a genetic condition, such as achondroplasia. Many children born with DSS have parents of average height and the faulty gene causing the condition occurred by chance. If your child is diagnosed with restricted growth, tests will be carried out to try to identify the underlying cause. Read more about the causes of restricted growth and diagnosing restricted growth. Managing restricted growth Treatments recommended for people with restricted growth depend on the cause of the condition and any associated problems they have. A number of different healthcare professionals will usually be involved in your care. Some people with restricted growth may benefit from treatment with growth hormone injections, which can help a child with restricted growth grow more than they otherwise would. In cases of DSS where the legs are particularly short, a leg-lengthening procedure is sometimes used, although this is controversial and there is uncertainty about its safety and effectiveness.

It's also one of the most common reasons people call 999 for an ambulance. It's normal to get out of breath when you've overexerted yourself, but when breathlessness comes on suddenly and unexpectedly, it's usually a warning sign of a medical condition. The information below outlines the most common reasons for: sudden shortness of breath long-term shortness of breath This guide shouldn't be used to self-diagnose your condition, but should give you an idea of what's causing your breathlessness. When to call a doctor You should call your GP immediately if you have sudden shortness of breath, as there may be a problem with your airways or heart. Your GP will assess you over the phone, and may either visit you at home or admit you to hospital. If your shortness of breath is the result of anxiety, you may be asked to come to the surgery rather than a home visit. If you've struggled with your breathing for a while, don't ignore it. See your GP as it's likely you have a long-term condition, such as obesity, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which needs to be managed properly. Your doctor may ask you some questions, such as: Did the breathlessness come on suddenly or gradually? Did anything trigger it, such as exercise? How bad is it? Does it only happen when you've been active, or when you're not doing anything? Is there any pain when you breathe? Do you have a cough? Do certain positions make it worse \u2013 for example, are you unable to lie down? Feeling like you can't get enough air can be terrifying, but doctors are well trained in managing this. You may be given extra oxygen to breathe if this is needed. Causes of sudden shortness of breath Sudden and unexpected breathlessness is most likely to be caused by one of the following health conditions. Click on the links below for more information about these conditions. A problem with your lungs or airways Sudden breathlessness could be an asthma attack. This means your airways have narrowed and you'll produce more phlegm (sticky mucus), which causes you to wheeze and cough. You'll feel breathless because it's difficult to move air in and out of your airways. Your GP may advise you to use a spacer device with your asthma inhaler. This delivers more medicine to your lungs, helping to relieve your breathlessness. Pneumonia (lung inflammation) may also cause shortness of breath and a cough. It's usually caused by an infection, so you'll need to take antibiotics. If you have COPD, it's likely your breathlessness is a sign this condition has suddenly got worse. A heart problem  It's possible to have a \"silent\" heart attack without experiencing all the obvious symptoms, such as chest pain and overwhelming anxiety. In this case, shortness of breath may be the only warning sign you're having a heart attack. If you or your GP think this is the case, they'll give you aspirin and admit you to hospital straight away. Heart failure can also cause breathing difficulties. This life-threatening condition means your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly. It leads to a build-up of water inside the lungs, which makes breathing more difficult. A combination of lifestyle changes and medicines or surgery will help the heart pump better and relieve your breathlessness. Breathlessness could also relate to a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate). Panic attack or anxiety A panic attack or anxiety can cause you to take rapid or deep breaths, known as hyperventilating. Concentrating on slow breathing or breathing through a paper bag should bring your breathing back to normal. More unusual causes These include: a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) pneumothorax \u2013 partial collapse of your lung caused by a small tear in the lung surface, which allows air to become trapped in the space around your lungs pulmonary embolism \u2013 a blockage in one of the blood vessels in the lung idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis \u2013 a rare and poorly understood lung condition that causes scarring of the lungs pleural effusion \u2013 a collection of fluid next to the lung diabetic ketoacidosis \u2013 a complication of diabetes where acids build up in your blood and urine Causes of long-term breathlessness Long-term breathlessness is usually caused by: obesity or being unfit poorly controlled asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \u2013 permanent damage to the lungs usually caused by years of smoking anaemia \u2013 a low level of oxygen in the blood caused by a lack of red blood cells or haemoglobin (the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen) heart failure \u2013 when your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate) More unusual causes of long-term breathlessness are: bronchiectasis \u2013 a lung condition where the airways are abnormally widened and you have a persistent phlegmy cough pulmonary embolism \u2013 a recurrent blockage in a blood vessel in the lung partial collapse of your lung caused by lung cancer pleural effusion \u2013 a collection of fluid next to the lung narrowing of the main heart valve, restricting blood flow to the rest of the body frequent panic attacks, which can cause you to hyperventilate (take rapid or deep breaths)  Page last reviewed: 29\/01\/2015 Next review due: 29\/01\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's thought to affect up to one in three people in the UK and is becoming more common. Short-sightedness can range from mild, where treatment may not be required, to severe, where a person's vision is significantly affected. The condition usually starts around puberty and gets gradually worse until the eye is fully grown, but it can also develop in very young children. Signs that your child may be short-sighted can include: needing to sit near the front of the class at school because they find it difficult to read the whiteboard sitting close to the TV complaining of headaches or tired eyes regularly rubbing their eyes Getting your eyes tested If you think you or your child may be short-sighted, you should book an eye test at a local opticians. Find an opticians near you. You should have a routine eye test at least every two years, but you can have a test at any point if you have any concerns about your vision. An eye test can confirm whether you're short or long-sighted, and you can be given a prescription for glasses or contact lenses to correct your vision. For some people \u2013 such as children under 16, or those under 19 and in full-time education \u2013 eye tests are available free of charge on the NHS. Read about NHS eyecare entitlements to check if you qualify. Read more about diagnosing short-sightedness. What causes short-sightedness? Short-sightedness usually occurs when the eyes grow slightly too long. This means that light doesn't focus on the light-sensitive tissue (retina) at the back of the eye properly. Instead, the light rays focus just in front of the retina, resulting in distant objects appearing blurred. It's not clear exactly why this happens, but it often runs in families and has been linked to focusing on nearby objects, such as books and computers, for long periods during childhood. Ensuring your child regularly spends time playing outside may help to reduce their risk of becoming short-sighted. Read more about the causes of short-sightedness. Treatments for short-sightedness Short-sightedness can usually be corrected effectively with a number of treatments. The main treatments are: corrective lenses \u2013 such as glasses or contact lenses to help the eyes focus on distant objects laser eye surgery to alter the shape of the eye \u2013 this isn't usually available on the NHS and shouldn't be carried out on children, whose eyes are still developing artificial lens implants \u2013 where a man-made lens is permanently inserted into the eyes to help them focus correctly; these are also not usually available on the NHS Read more about treating short-sightedness. Associated eye conditions Some adults with severe short-sightedness and young children with untreated short-sightedness are more likely to develop other eye problems. These can include: a squint \u2013 a common childhood condition where the eyes point in different directions a lazy eye \u2013  a childhood condition where the vision in one eye doesn't develop properly glaucoma \u2013 increased pressure inside the eyes cataracts \u2013 where cloudy patches develop inside the lens of the eye retinal detachment \u2013 where the retina pulls away from the blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients Page last reviewed: 02\/09\/2015 Next review due: 02\/09\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It takes between 12 and 16 weeks to heal after the shoulder has been put back into place. Dislocating your shoulder means the ball joint of your upper arm has popped out of the shoulder socket. The surrounding tissues may also have become overstretched or torn. The shoulder is one of the easiest joints to dislocate because the ball joint sits in a very shallow socket. This makes the arm extremely mobile and able to move in many directions, but also means it's not very stable. Most people dislocate their shoulder during a contact sport such as rugby, or in a sports-related accident. In older people the cause is often falling onto outstretched hands, for example after slipping on ice. Shoulder dislocations can occur more easily in people who are highy flexible, such as those with joint hypermobility (loose joints).  How do I know if I've dislocated my shoulder? In most cases of dislocated shoulder, the ball part of the joint pops out in front of the shoulder socket. This is usually obvious because: you won't be able to move the arm and it will be extremely painful the shoulder will suddenly look square rather than round you may be able to see a lump or bulge (the top of the arm bone) under the skin in front of your shoulder It's much more unusual for the bone to pop out of the back of the shoulder joint. This usually happens after an epileptic fit or electrocution injury and is less easy to spot. What you should do If you think you have dislocated your shoulder, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately. Don't try to pop your arm back in yourself, as this could damage the tissues, nerves and blood vessels around the shoulder joint. While waiting for medical help, avoid moving your upper arm as much as possible. Place something soft, such as a folded blanket or pillow, in the gap between the arm and side of the chest to support it. If you can, make a simple sling to hold the lower arm across the chest, with the elbow bent at a right angle. How a dislocated shoulder is treated When you get to A&E, you will be assessed and examined. You will usually be X-rayed to make sure you haven't broken any bones, as it's fairly common for someone who has dislocated their shoulder to also break the bone of their upper arm or the joint. If you do have a fracture, further scans may also be carried out to investigate it in more detail. Fractures with a shoulder dislocation will require specialist orthopaedic care and may involve surgery. If you don\u2019t have any fractures, your arm will be gently manipulated back into its shoulder joint using a procedure known as reduction. Surgery is sometimes necessary if the tissues surrounding the joint are badly torn and the joint is not stable. If the tissues are overstretched but not torn, surgery can sometimes be avoided by doing appropriate exercises to strengthen the shoulder. Reduction You will be given some medication to sedate you and ensure you are as relaxed and pain-free as possible. Reduction is usually carried out in the A&E department, but sometimes it is done in the operating theatre under general anaesthetic (where you are asleep) under the care of an orthopaedic team. You will usually sit on the bed while the doctor rotates your arm around the shoulder joint until it goes back in its socket. This may take a few minutes. Once the shoulder joint is back in place, you will often have another X-ray to check the shoulder is in the correct position. Repairing tears in the shoulder tissues Some people tear a rotator cuff tendon (bands of tissue that stretch over the top of the shoulder) as well as the labrum (the cuff of tough tissue surrounding and supporting the shoulder joint) when they dislocate their shoulder. If these tissues have been damaged, you may need surgery to repair them. For some people, this can significantly reduce the risk of dislocating the same shoulder again in the future (see below). These operations are carried out under general anaesthetic and are increasingly being done with keyhole surgery, using only small incisions and an arthroscope (a thin tube fitted with a light source and a camera). Recovering from a dislocated shoulder You can usually go home soon after reduction, but you'll need to rest your arm in a sling for a few weeks. You will usually be referred to the orhopaedic department for follow-up care and you may also be referred to a physiotherapist for rehabilitation to strengthen your shoulder. Arm and shoulder exercises You may be asked to rest your arm in the sling for two to three weeks while the soft tissues around the shoulder repair themselves. After this, a physiotherapist can show you some gentle arm and shoulder exercises to do at home with your arm out of its sling. These will help reduce stiffness, relieve some of the pain and build up strength in your shoulder muscles. Before you begin your exercises, hold an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) on the shoulder for 10 to 15 minutes and take some painkillers. For some useful exercises to get you started, see the NHS leaflet: rehabilitation after shoulder dislocation (PDF, 482kb). It's normal to experience aching, discomfort or stretching when doing these exercises. However, if you have intense pain for more than 30 minutes, do the exercise less forcefully and less often. It's better to do short, frequent sessions of five to 10 minutes four times a day rather than one long session, and to gradually increase the number of repetitions you do. Pain relief The shoulder may be very painful during the first two to three weeks at home and you may need to take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. Always follow the dosage instructions on the packet. If this doesn't control the pain, see your GP for a prescription for a stronger painkiller, such as codeine. Recovery time You can stop wearing the sling after a few weeks, but it takes about 12 to 16 weeks to completely recover from a dislocated shoulder. You can usually resume most activities within two weeks, but avoid heavy lifting and playing sports involving shoulder movements for six weeks to three months. Your orthopaedic surgeon and physiotherapist will advise you. You'll probably be off work for two to four weeks, or longer if you have a physical job. Discuss this with your GP, physiotherapist or consultant. If you've also broken your arm or shoulder joint, you may need to wear your sling for up to six weeks and recovery will take longer. Dislocating the shoulder a second time If you've dislocated your shoulder once, you're more likely to dislocate it again in the future \u2013 particularly if you're less than 20 years old. Your chances of another dislocation depend partly on how well the tissues surrounding the joint healed the first time. It can help if the torn tissues were surgically repaired after the dislocated shoulder was fixed. Regularly doing the exercises your physiotherapist recommends and avoiding awkward arm positions can also reduce the risk of dislocating your shoulder again.

Read more about the causes of shoulder pain. Treating shoulder pain There are things you can do yourself to treat shoulder pain, including using painkillers such as ibuprofen, or ice packs to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Avoiding activities that may aggravate your symptoms will also help. Depending on the cause of your shoulder pain, you may need further treatment, such as: physiotherapy injections of corticosteroids \u2013 a type of medication that contains hormones  surgery (in some cases) In most cases, shoulder disorders improve over time if treatment advice is followed. Read about how shoulder pain is treated. When to see your GP You should see your GP if your pain is the result of an injury, is particularly bad, or there is no sign of improvement after a couple of weeks.

It involves the rotator cuff tendon \u2013 a tough, rubbery cord that connects the muscles in your shoulder to the top of your arm. The tendon and muscle run through a narrow space at the top of the shoulder called the subacromial space. In shoulder impingement syndrome, the tendon becomes trapped in this space and repeatedly scrapes against the bone above, causing pain that tends to be worse when you raise your arm over your head. You may also experience a persistent ache in your shoulder and pain at night. Shoulder impingement syndrome can start suddenly after an injury, or (generally from middle age onwards) it can come on gradually without any obvious cause. What causes shoulder impingement syndrome? The subacromial space is naturally quite narrow, especially when the arm is raised. Anything that further narrows this space can cause the tendon to become trapped. Possible causes include: bone spurs under the bony roof (acromion) at the top of the subacromial space can narrow the space and catch on the tendon swelling or thickening of the rotator cuff tendon \u2013 which may result from an injury or general overuse of the shoulder inflammation of the fluid-filled sac (bursa) that lies between the rotator cuff tendon and acromion (known as \"bursitis\") a build-up of calcium deposits within the rotator cuff tendon Seeking medical advice See your GP if you have persistent shoulder pain. They should be able to diagnose shoulder impingement syndrome by asking about your symptoms and examining your shoulder. You may also be asked to do some specific arm movements to help them work out the cause of your pain. If the cause of your pain is unclear, your GP may refer you for a specialist assessment by a shoulder surgeon, who may also carry out some scans of your shoulder. This can help to rule out other possible causes of shoulder pain. Treating shoulder impingement syndrome Caring for your shoulder at home If shoulder impingement syndrome is only mild, the following measures may be all that are needed: Rest the tendon \u2013 Avoiding any overarm movements will help prevent any further inflammation (swelling) or damage. Your doctor or physiotherapist will tell you how long you should rest it for, and when you should start exercises (see below). Ice packs \u2013 Holding an ice pack to the shoulder for around 20 minutes several times a day may help to ease the pain. Don't put ice directly on your skin \u2013 wrap it in a towel. If you don't have an ice pack, try ice cubes or a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel. Painkillers \u2013 Mild non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can provide short-term pain relief and are available as tablets or a gel that you apply to the shoulder. Other painkillers, such as paracetamol, may also help to ease the pain. If your pain is more severe, a stronger painkiller such as codeine can be prescribed. Exercises While it's important to rest the shoulder joint, you shouldn't stop movement altogether. Inactivity will cause the muscles to weaken, which will worsen the problem and cause your shoulder to stiffen up. For this reason, a sling is not usually recommended. Your GP may refer you to a physiotherapist, who will be able to recommend some arm exercises to help stretch and strengthen your shoulder, and improve your range of movement. After an initial period of supervision by a physiotherapist, you will usually be able to continue doing these exercises at home. Read more about physiotherapy. Corticosteroid injections Corticosteroids are medications that can be used to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. If there is swelling and evidence of inflammation in your shoulder, corticosteroids can be injected directly into the affected area. They may also be combined with local anaesthetic to further help relieve your pain. Although corticosteroid injections can relieve pain, without physiotherapy they do not have a long-term effect, and it's common for the pain to return. You can sometimes have another injection, but you will need to wait at least six weeks. Usually, no more than one to two injections into the same area are recommended. Possible side effects of corticosteroid injections include thinning and lightening of the skin. Surgery If the treatments above aren't effective, you may need an operation to widen the subacromial space in your shoulder, so the rotator cuff tendon is no longer rubbing against the bone above. This is known as subacromial decompression. This can usually be done using a technique called arthroscopy, which is a type of keyhole surgery carried out under general anaesthetic, where special surgical instruments and a thin, flexible tube containing a camera are inserted through small cuts in your skin. This means you should recover faster and with less scarring than if a larger cut was made. Most people are able to go home the same day or the day after. This technique can also be used to remove any calcium deposits that have formed in the tendon in your shoulder.

It's one of the most common anxiety disorders. Social anxiety disorder is much more than \"shyness\". It can be intense fear and anxiety over simple everyday activities, such as shopping or speaking on the phone. Many people sometimes worry about certain social situations, but someone with social anxiety disorder will worry excessively about them before, during and afterwards. They fear doing or saying something they think will be embarrassing or humiliating, such as blushing, sweating or appearing incompetent. Social anxiety disorder is a type of complex phobia. This type of phobia has a disruptive or disabling impact on a person's life. It can severely affect a person's confidence and self-esteem, interfere with relationships and impair performance at work or school. Social anxiety disorder often starts during childhood or adolescence and tends to be more common in women. It's a recognised disorder that can be effectively treated, so you should see your GP if you think you have it.  Signs of social anxiety disorder A child with social anxiety disorder may cry more than usual, freeze, or have tantrums. They may fear going to school and taking part in classroom activities and school performances. Teens and adults with social anxiety disorder may: dread everyday activities, such as: meeting strangers talking in groups or starting conversations speaking on the telephone talking to authority figures working eating or drinking with company shopping have low self-esteem and feel insecure about their relationships fear being criticised avoid eye-to-eye contact misuse drugs or alcohol to try to reduce their anxiety Panic attacks The fear of a social situation can sometimes build up to a panic attack, where you feel an overwhelming sense of fear, apprehension and anxiety. This usually only lasts a few minutes. You may also experience physical symptoms, such as feeling sick, sweating, trembling and heart palpitations. These symptoms often reach a peak before quickly passing. Although these type of symptoms can be alarming, they don't cause any physical harm. Read more about dealing with panic attacks.  Other mental health problems Many people with social anxiety disorder will also have another mental health problem, such as: depression generalised anxiety disorder panic disorder post-traumatic stress disorder Some people may also have a substance or alcohol misuse problem, because they use drugs or alcohol as a way of coping with their anxiety. What causes social anxiety disorder? As with many mental health conditions, social anxiety disorder is most probably the result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Anxiety disorders often run in families, so you're more likely to have social anxiety disorder if a close family member is affected. However, the exact nature of the relationship between genetics and learned behaviour is uncertain. The behaviour of parents may also have an influence on whether their child will develop social anxiety disorder. If you have worried or anxious parents, it can often affect your ability to cope with anxiety during childhood, adolescence and adulthood. People with social anxiety disorder often describe their parents as: overprotective not affectionate enough constantly criticising them and worrying they may do something wrong overemphasising the importance of manners and grooming exaggerating the danger of approaching strangers Getting help If you think you may have social anxiety disorder, you should try to see your GP for help. Your GP should make it as easy as possible for you to have a consultation with them. For example, they may offer you an assessment over the phone if it's easier, or they may give you an appointment when the surgery is less busy \u2013 for example, before or after normal hours.  If your anxiety is severe, or you'd like your child to be assessed, your GP may be able to visit you at home.  Diagnosing social anxiety disorder Your GP may ask you some questions from a diagnostic questionnaire, such as the Social Phobia Inventory, Social Phobia Scale or Social Interaction Anxiety Scale. These give a score that indicates your level of anxiety in social situations (there are similar scales designed for use on children). The type of questions your GP might ask you are: do you\/does your child tend to avoid social places or activities? do you\/does your child get scared about doing things with other people, like talking, eating and going to parties? do you\/does your child find it difficult to do things when others are watching? Your GP will want to rule out other possible causes of your fear, such as generalised anxiety disorder or agoraphobia (a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or where help wouldn't be available if things go wrong). They'll also want to explore whether you have any other problems that would need to be treated separately, such as depression or an alcohol or drug problem. Read about treating depression, drug misuse and treating alcohol misuse. Treating social anxiety disorder in adults If you've been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, there are a number of different treatment options available. Cognitive behavioural therapy Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective treatments for social anxiety disorder. Generally, CBT works by helping you identify unhelpful and unrealistic beliefs and behavioural patterns. You and your therapist work together to change your behaviour and replace unhelpful beliefs with more realistic and balanced ones. CBT teaches new skills and helps you understand how to react more positively to situations that would usually cause you anxiety. Your therapy sessions may include learning about social anxiety, graduated exposure to feared social situations (which may include some homework), examining and modifying your core beliefs and helping to prevent relapse. CBT involves a considerable time commitment. The exact amount of time required can vary, depending on your specific condition and response to therapy. One example is 15 hourly sessions, plus one of 90 minutes. However, you may require fewer or more sessions, or you may need fewer sessions that last longer. Supported self-help If you wish to try a different psychological therapy, you may be offered supported self-help. This could be in the form of a CBT-based book or computer programme to try over three to four months. One of the most widely-used self-help therapies for people with anxiety or phobias is FearFighter, which is available on the NHS in some areas. You can also pay to do the course privately. Learn more about self-help therapies. Antidepressants Some people may benefit from trying a type of antidepressant medication, usually a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), either instead of or in combination with individual CBT. SSRIs increase the level of serotonin in your brain. They can be taken on a long-term basis. As with all antidepressants, SSRIs can take several weeks to start working. You'll usually be started on a low dose, which will gradually be increased as your body gets used to the medicine. Escitalopram or sertraline are the two SSRIs often prescribed to treat social anxiety disorder. If you're prescribed one of these, you'll initially be asked to see your GP every few weeks to check on your progress and see if you're responding well to it. Common side effects of SSRIs include: feeling agitated, shaky or anxious feeling or being sick indigestion diarrhoea or constipation loss of appetite and weight loss dizziness blurred vision thirst or dry mouth excessive sweating sleeping problems (insomnia) headaches low sex drive (loss of libido) difficulty achieving orgasm during sex or masturbation in men, difficulty obtaining or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) When you and your GP decide that it's appropriate for you to stop taking your SSRI medication, your dose will gradually be reduced. You should only stop taking your medication when your GP advises you to do so. Psychotherapy If all of the above interventions aren't right for you, for whatever reason, you may be offered interpersonal psychotherapy or short-term psychotherapy specifically designed for social anxiety disorder. Psychotherapy generally involves talking to a trained therapist either one-to-one, in a group, or with your wife, husband or partner. It allows you to look deeper into your problems and worries, and deal with troublesome habits and a wide range of mental disorders. Interpersonal psychotherapy aims to link social anxiety to relationship problem areas and address these. You'll probably be offered 16-20 sessions over four to five months. Short-term psychotherapy for social anxiety disorder aims to improve your social skills, and encourage you to face feared social situations outside therapy sessions. A course of treatment usually consists of 25-30 sessions that last 50 minutes, over a six- to eight-month period.  Treating social anxiety disorder in children The psychological therapies offered to adults outlined above should also be considered for children aged 15 and older. Both group-based and individual CBT should take into account how well the child or young person can process thoughts and emotions.  For individual CBT, the recommended number of sessions is eight to 12, each one lasting 45 minutes. Sessions will include gradually exposing the child to feared or avoided social situations and training them in social skills, rehearsing their use in social situations. There will also be training for parents. Group-based CBT may be offered for children and young people aged seven and older. As with individual CBT, group sessions aim to gradually expose affected children to feared or avoided social situations, and train them in social skills. There may be eight to 12 sessions, each lasting 90 minutes. Parent-driven CBT is more appropriate for younger children. Parents are trained to use CBT-based materials with their children, such as books designed to treat their child's anxiety problem.

SBS symptoms The symptoms of SBS may include: headaches and dizziness nausea (feeling sick) aches and pains fatigue (extreme tiredness) poor concentration shortness of breath or chest tightness eye and throat irritation irritated, blocked or runny nose skin irritation (skin rashes, dry itchy skin) The symptoms of SBS can occur on their own or in combination with each other, and they may vary from day to day. Different individuals in the same building may experience different symptoms. They usually improve or disappear altogether when you leave the building and often return when you re-enter the building. Who's affected by SBS? Anyone can be affected by SBS, but office workers in modern buildings without opening windows and with mechanical ventilation or air conditioning systems are most at risk. The likelihood of experiencing SBS symptoms can be higher if you're employed in routine work that involves using display screen equipment. If you or your employees use computer equipment at work, you should ensure that both the equipment and work area are set up correctly and are in line with the Health and Safety Executive\u2019s Display Screen Equipment Regulations (1992) (PDF, 254kb). Read more tips about how to use a laptop correctly and safely. Women are more likely to develop the symptoms of SBS than men. This may be because more women work in offices, rather than women being more susceptible to the condition. SBS environments SBS seems to be associated with certain types of buildings. Most cases occur in open plan offices, but people sometimes develop the symptoms while in other buildings that are occupied by lots of people such as: schools libraries museums There have also been anecdotal reports of people experiencing symptoms such as headaches, tiredness and dizziness at home. Although these symptoms aren't necessarily related to SBS, it's important to ensure your home is a safe environment. Make sure you have working smoke alarms fitted and that gas appliances, such as cookers and boilers, are regularly serviced. Make sure you can open the windows to allow you to ventilate your home, and keep your home as dust-free as possible. Keeping the rooms free of clutter and in good decorative order will also help make your home a pleasant environment in which to live. Read more about preventing carbon monoxide poisoning and keeping your home clean. Risk factors Since the 1970s, researchers have tried to identify the cause of SBS. As yet, no single cause has been identified. Most experts believe that it may be the result of a combination of things. Possible risk factors for SBS may include: poor ventilation low humidity high temperature or changes in temperature throughout the day airborne particles, such as dust, carpet fibres or fungal spores airborne chemical pollutants, such as those from cleaning materials or furniture, or ozone produced by photocopiers and printers physical factors, such as electrostatic charges poor standards of cleanliness in the working environment inadequate ventilation when using chemical cleaning products   poor lighting that causes glare or flicker on visual display units improper use of display screen equipment psychological factors, such as stress or low staff morale Advice for employees If you think your working environment is making you ill, talk to your colleagues to see whether they have similar symptoms. If SBS appears to be a workplace issue, you should raise it with your line manager. They'll be able to investigate the matter further with the help of your health and safety representative. Your employer has a duty of care to investigate the problem. For further advice, your employer should have access to an occupational health service. The environmental health services of your local authority or your local Health and Safety Executive (HSE) office may also be able to provide help and advice about how to deal with SBS. Visit GOV.UK to find your local authority. To find your local HSE office you can call the HSE's helpline number on 0845 345 0055 (Monday to Friday, 8am-6pm). Visit your GP if you have symptoms of SBS that you're particularly concerned about. Employer\u2019s responsibilities The HSE recommends that employers take the steps outlined below to investigate the possible causes of SBS. Carry out an employee survey to find out whether symptoms are occurring more often than expected. It may also help to identify any obvious causes that can easily be fixed, such as adjusting the office temperature. See below for more information. Check the general cleanliness of the building, including checking that the vacuum cleaners are working properly and are regularly emptied and their filters are clean. Check that cleaning materials are being used properly and stored correctly. Check the operation of the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system. In particular, the system that supplies fresh air should be checked. Check the condition and cleanliness of air filters, humidifiers, de-humidifiers and cooling towers. The HSE recommends humidity of 40-70% should be maintained in office environments. Check heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system maintenance schedules. Make sure they're being followed properly. Once the above steps have been completed and any necessary actions have been taken, employers should carry out another employee survey at a later date to find out whether employees are still experiencing the symptoms of SBS. If the SBS symptoms are still present, a more detailed investigation will be needed. This can be carried out by a building services engineer or another similarly qualified consultant. Employee surveys There can be advantages in employers being proactive about SBS and asking individual workers informally whether they have any concerns about their working environment. If there are credible reports of symptoms, a survey should be arranged in a way that tries to avoid employee discussion, which can distort the findings. A simple survey should cover the frequency of symptoms and whether they improve outside of the building. Conducting this type of survey can help identify any issues which can then be dealt with before they become more serious problems. Workplace health There are a number of measures you can take at work to help prevent the symptoms of sick building syndrome. For example, you can: open windows to avoid getting too hot organise and prioritise your workload to help prevent stress take regular screen breaks of five to 10 minutes (if you use a computer) for every hour that you're sitting at your desk go outside for some fresh air and a walk during lunchtime and break time  eat healthily and exercise regularly to help maintain high energy levels and good posture while at work Read more about workplace health.

The most serious type is called sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell disease mainly affects people of African, Caribbean, Middle Eastern, Eastern Mediterranean and Asian origin. In the UK, it's particularly common in people with an African or Caribbean family background. People with sickle cell disease produce unusually shaped red blood cells that can cause problems because they don't live as long as healthy blood cells and they can become stuck in blood vessels. Sickle cell disease is a serious and lifelong condition, although long-term treatment can help manage many of the problems associated with it. This page covers: Symptoms Causes Screening and testing Treatments Outlook Carriers Symptoms of sickle cell disease People born with sickle cell disease sometimes experience problems from early childhood, although most children have few symptoms and lead normal lives most of the time. The main symptoms of sickle cell disease are: painful episodes called sickle cell crises, which can be very severe and can last up to a week an increased risk of serious infections anaemia (where red blood cells can't carry enough oxygen around the body), which can cause tiredness and shortness of breath Some people also experience other problems such as delayed growth, strokes and lung problems. Read more about the symptoms of sickle cell disease. Causes of sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease is caused by a faulty gene that affects how red blood cells develop. If both parents have this faulty gene, there's a 25% chance of each child they have being born with sickle cell disease. The child's parents often won't have the condition themselves because they're only carriers of the sickle cell trait (see below). Read more about the causes of sickle cell disease. Screening and testing for sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease is often detected during pregnancy or soon after birth. Screening for sickle cell disease in pregnancy is offered to all pregnant women in England to check if there's a risk of a child being born with the condition, and all babies are offered screening as part of the newborn blood spot test (heel prick test). Blood tests can also be carried out at any age to check for the condition or to see if you're a carrier of the faulty gene that causes it. Read more about screening and testing for sickle cell disease. Treatments for sickle cell disease People with sickle cell disease will need specialist care throughout their lives. A number of treatments are available to help manage problems caused by the condition. For example: painful episodes can sometimes be prevented by drinking plenty of fluids and staying warm pain can often be treated with ordinary painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, although sometimes treatment with stronger painkillers in hospital may be necessary the risk of infections can be reduced by taking daily antibiotics and ensuring you're fully vaccinated a blood transfusion may be needed if severe anaemia develops a medicine called hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) can reduce the symptoms if they're interfering with your or your child's life having regular blood transfusions (usually every 3-4 weeks) may be helpful if problems continue or get worse, or there are signs of damage caused by the condition Stem cell or bone marrow transplants can potentially cure sickle cell disease, but they're not done very often because of the significant risks involved. Read more about how sickle cell disease is treated and living with sickle cell disease. Outlook for sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease is very variable, but most children with it will lead happy and normal lives. However, it can still be a serious condition that can have a significant impact on a person's life. It can lead to problems such as strokes, serious infections and lung problems, which can occasionally be fatal. Overall, the life expectancy for someone with sickle cell disease tends to be shorter than normal, but this can vary depending on the exact type of sickle cell disease they have, how it's treated, and what problems they experience. Currently, people with sickle cell anaemia typically live until 40-60 years of age, although milder types of sickle cell disease may have no impact on life expectancy. It's hoped the outlook will continue to improve as newer treatments are developed. Carriers of sickle cell (sickle cell trait) A carrier of sickle cell is someone who carries one of the faulty genes that causes sickle cell disease, but doesn't have the condition themselves. It's also known as having the sickle cell trait. People who carry sickle cell won't develop sickle cell disease, but are at risk of having a child with the condition if their partner is also a carrier. You can request a blood test to check if you have carry sickle cell from your GP surgery or nearest sickle cell and thalassaemia centre. Read more about being a sickle cell carrier. Information about you If you have sickle cell anaemia, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

If you are a carrier of sickle cell or thalassaemia, you can pass these conditions on to your baby. All pregnant women in England are offered a blood test to find out if they carry a gene for thalassaemia, and those at high risk of being a sickle cell carrier are also offered a test for sickle cell. If the mother is found to be a carrier, screening is also offered to the father.  This test should be offered before you're 10 weeks pregnant. It's important the test is done early \u2013 if you find out you're a carrier, you and your partner will have the option of further tests to know if your baby will be affected. This page covers: Why will I be offered screening in pregnancy? What does the screening test involve? Do I have to have this screening test? Getting your screening results Further tests in pregnancy if the mother's a carrier If your unborn baby has sickle cell disease or thalassaemia major What if I decide not to have screening when I'm pregnant? Can anyone have a test for sickle cell and thalassaemia? Finding out you're a carrier What if I get pregnant and already know I'm a carrier or my partner is a carrier? About sickle cell and thalassaemia Sickle cell disease and thalassaemia major affect haemoglobin, a part of the blood that carries oxygen around the body. People who have these conditions will need specialist care throughout their lives. People with sickle cell: can have episodes of very severe pain can get serious, life-threatening infections are usually anaemic \u2013 their bodies have difficulty carrying oxygen Babies with sickle cell disease can receive early treatment, including immunisations and antibiotics. This, along with support from their parents, will help prevent serious illness and allow the child to live a healthier life. Find out more about sickle cell disease. People with thalassaemia major are very anaemic and need a blood transfusion every three to five weeks, as well as injections and medicines throughout their lives. Read more about thalassaemia. There are also other less common, and less serious, haemoglobin disorders that may be found through screening. Why will I be offered screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia early in pregnancy? Screening is offered to find out if you are a carrier of a gene for sickle cell or thalassaemia and therefore likely to pass it on to your baby. Genes are the codes in our bodies for things like eye colour and blood group. Genes work in pairs: for everything we inherit, we get one gene from our mother and one gene from our father. People only have sickle cell disease or thalassaemia major if they inherit two unusual haemoglobin genes \u2013 one from their mother and one from their father. People who inherit just one unusual gene are known as \"carriers\", or as having a \"trait\". Carriers are healthy and do not have the disease. Sickle cell carriers can experience some problems in situations where their bodies might not get enough oxygen, such as having a general anaesthetic. All carriers can pass the unusual gene on to their children. When both parents are carriers When both parents are carriers, each time they are expecting a child there is: a one in four (25%) chance of the child not being affected \u2013 the baby will not have or carry the disease a one in four (25%) chance of inheriting both unusual haemoglobin genes and having the disease a two in four (50%) chance of inheriting one unusual haemoglobin gene and being a carrier Anyone can be a carrier of haemoglobin disease. However, it is more common among people with ancestors from Africa, the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, India, Pakistan, south and southeast Asia, and the Middle East. Read more about being a carrier of sickle cell disease or a carrier of thalassaemia. What does the screening test involve? Screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia involves a blood test. It's best to have the test before you are 10 weeks pregnant. This is because you'll have the option of more tests to find out whether your baby will be affected if this first test shows you're a carrier of a blood disorder. By having the test early, you and your partner can find out about all your options and make an informed decision if your baby is at risk of inheriting a blood disorder \u2013 see Further tests if the mother is a carrier.  All pregnant women are offered a test for thalassaemia, but not all women are automatically offered a test for sickle cell. In areas where haemoglobin diseases are more common, all women will automatically be offered a blood test for sickle cell. In areas where haemoglobin diseases are less common, a questionnaire is used to identify your family origins and the origins of the baby's father. If the questionnaire shows that either you or the baby's father is at risk of being a sickle cell carrier, you will be offered a screening test. You can ask to have the test even if your family origins do not suggest the baby would be at high risk of a haemoglobin disease. Can this screening harm me or my baby? No, the screening test cannot harm you or your baby, but it is important to think carefully about whether or not to have this test. It can provide information that may mean you have to make further important decisions. For example, you may be offered further tests that have a risk of miscarriage. Do I have to have this screening test? No, you do not have to have the screening test. Some people want to find out if their baby has sickle cell disease or thalassaemia, while others do not. Getting your screening results The test will tell you if you are a carrier or not, or whether you have the disease yourself. You will get the result of the blood test within two weeks. The person doing the test will discuss the arrangements for getting your results to you. If you are found to be a carrier of sickle cell or thalassaemia, you will be contacted by a specialist nurse or midwife counsellor for genetic counselling. Further tests in pregnancy if the mother is a carrier Testing to see if the father is a carrier If the screening test finds that you are a carrier of a haemoglobin disease, your baby's father will also be offered a blood test. If tests show the father is not a carrier, your baby will not have sickle cell disease or thalassaemia major and you will not be offered further tests in pregnancy. However, there is still a 50% chance your baby could be a carrier and pass on the unusual gene to their children. You can discuss the implications of you or your baby being a carrier with your GP or a healthcare professional at your local sickle cell and thalassaemia centre. Read more about finding out you're a carrier. Diagnostic tests when both parents are carriers If tests show your baby's father is also a carrier, there is a one in four chance (25%) that your baby can have the disease. You will be offered further tests called diagnostic tests to find out if your baby is affected. A diagnostic test will tell you: if your baby has sickle cell disease, thalassaemia major or another haemoglobin disorder if your baby is carrier if your baby is completely unaffected If the baby's father is not available and you have been identified as a carrier, you will be offered a diagnostic test. About 1 in 100 diagnostic tests result in a miscarriage. It is up to you whether or not to have the diagnostic test. It can be a very difficult time if you are told you are at risk of having a baby with sickle cell disease or thalassaemia major. You can talk to your midwife, specialist nurse or doctor about your situation and your options. You can also get information and support from the charity Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC). They have a helpline you can call for information and support on 0845 077 2290, or 020 7713 7486 from a mobile. There are two types of diagnostic test: chorionic villus sampling (CVS) \u2013 this is usually performed from 11 to 14 weeks of pregnancy. A fine needle, usually put through the mother's abdomen, is used to take a tiny sample of tissue from the placenta. The cells from the tissue can be tested for sickle cell or thalassaemia. Read more about CVS. amniocentesis \u2013 this is done from 15 weeks of pregnancy. A fine needle is passed through the mother's abdomen into the uterus to collect a small sample of the fluid surrounding the baby. The fluid contains some of the baby's cells, which can be tested for sickle cell or thalassaemia. Read more about amniocentesis. If you find out your unborn baby has sickle cell disease or thalassaemia major If the result shows your baby has sickle cell disease or thalassaemia major, you will be offered an appointment with a health professional. You will be able to get information about the condition the baby has inherited and talk through your choices. Some conditions are more serious than others. Some women decide to continue with the pregnancy, while others decide they do not want to continue with the pregnancy and have a termination (abortion). If you are faced with this choice, you will get professional support to help you make a decision. Support for parents is also available from the charity ARC. If the test shows you are a carrier, there is a chance that other members of your family could be carriers, too. You may want to encourage them to ask for a test, especially if they are planning to have a baby. Find out more about what to expect when a screening test suggests there might be a problem. What if I decide not to have screening when I'm pregnant? If you choose not to have the screening test, your baby can still have screening for sickle cell disease as part of newborn blood spot screening a few days after the birth. Can anyone have a test for sickle cell and thalassaemia at any time? Although testing for sickle cell and thalassaemia is only offered during pregnancy, anyone can ask their GP or local sickle cell and thalassaemia centre for a free test at any time. If you or your partner are concerned you may be a carrier, perhaps because someone in your family has a blood disorder or is a carrier, it's a good idea to get tested before you start a family. That way you can understand your risk of passing on a blood disorder to any children you have, and discuss options for a healthy pregnancy with your GP or another healthcare professional.  Finding out you're a carrier If the test shows you are a carrier of sickle cell, thalassaemia or another haemoglobin variant, you will be contacted by a specialist nurse or midwife counsellor for genetic counselling. You will get a specific carrier result depending on the unusual haemoglobin gene you have inherited. You can find more detailed information about different types of carrier  in these leaflets: Sickle cell carrier Beta thalassaemia carrier Delta beta thalassaemia carrier Haemoglobin O Arab carrier Haemoglobin C carrier Haemoglobin D carrier Haemoglobin E carrier Haemoglobin Lepore carrier There is a chance that other members of your family could be carriers, too. You may want to encourage them to ask for a test, especially if they're planning to have a baby. They can ask their GP or local sickle cell and thalassaemia centre for a free test at any time.   What if I get pregnant and already know I'm a carrier or my partner is a carrier? If one parent is a carrier If you know that either your or your partner is a carrier of sickle cell or thalassaemia, the other parent should get tested as soon as possible if you want to understand your child's risk of inheriting one of these blood disorders, so you can find out about all your options. If both parents are carriers If you're pregnant and already know that both you and your partner are carriers \u2013 for example, because you found out in a previous pregnancy \u2013 you should talk to your GP or midwife as soon as possible. You will then have the option of being fast-tracked for a diagnostic test to find out if your baby's affected. Read more about being a carrier of sickle cell disease or a carrier of thalassaemia.

Also known as a stomach or tummy bug, it's usually caused by an infection. Most babies and toddlers who have diarrhoea and vomiting don't need treatment and you can safely look after them at home. However, it's important to look out for signs of dehydration. Babies and toddlers can become dehydrated more quickly than older children when they have diarrhoea and vomiting. If dehydration becomes severe it can be dangerous, particularly in young babies. It's also important to be careful with hygiene while your child is ill to stop diarrhoea and vomiting spreading. Looking after a baby or toddler with diarrhoea and vomiting When to get medical advice When to seek medical help urgently How to rehydrate your child with ORS solution Caring for your child once they're rehydrated How to stop diarrhoea and vomiting spreading Looking after a baby or toddler with diarrhoea and vomiting Carry on offering babies their usual milk feeds. Bottle fed babies can also have drinks of water between feeds. Keep giving them formula at the usual strength \u2013 never water it down. Toddlers over one can have other drinks, such as full-fat cows' milk, but avoid fruit juice and fizzy drinks as these can make diarrhoea worse. If your child is having solid foods, offer them food as usual if they seem to want it. If you wish, you can give your baby oral rehydration salt (ORS) solution to help prevent dehydration. This is available from your pharmacist. If you are worried about your child, you can speak to your GP, health visitor or pharmacist, or call NHS 111 for advice. When to get medical advice Vomiting usually lasts for 1-2 days, while diarrhoea lasts for about 5-7 days. If your child's symptoms last longer than this, or if they are showing signs of dehydration, speak to your GP. Signs of dehydration in a baby or toddler Your child may be dehydrated if they have: sunken eyes in young babies, a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head few or no tears when they cry a dry mouth fewer wet nappies dark yellow urine See other signs of dehydration. When to get medical help urgently Get medical advice urgently if your baby or toddler: seems to be deteriorating rather than getting better has a temperature of over 38C (100.4F) for a baby less than three months old, or over 39C (102.2F) for a baby aged three to six months old. (Over six months a child's temperature isn't the most useful indicator of how seriously ill they are.) Read more about how to take your baby's temperature. has blood or mucus in their poo has bile-stained (green) vomit has severe abdominal pain See other signs of serious illness in young children. How to rehydrate your child with ORS solution If your baby becomes dehydrated, they will need to be rehydrated with oral rehydration salt (ORS) solution, which is available from your pharmacist or GP. They will explain how to use it. The ORS solution helps replace the water and salts lost from your child's body because of the diarrhoea and vomiting. To rehydrate your baby or toddler, you need to offer them small amounts of ORS solution frequently over a period of about four hours. If your child is breastfed, keep offering them breastfeeds as well. If your child isn't breastfed, don't offer them any other drinks apart from the ORS solution unless a health professional suggests it. Don't offer your child any food while they are having the ORS solution. If your baby or toddler keeps vomiting the solution back up or won't drink it, speak to your GP. Don't give your child anti-diarrhoea drugs unless advised to by a health professional. Caring for your child once they're rehydrated Once your child is rehydrated, they can start to eat solid food again. Offer them plenty of their usual drinks, including milk feeds, but avoid fruit juice or fizzy drinks. If your child has more episodes of diarrhoea you may be advised to give them some ORS solution after each bout. How to stop diarrhoea and vomiting spreading Make sure everyone in the family washes their hands frequently, preferably using liquid soap with warm running water. They also need to dry their hands properly. It's particularly important for everyone to wash their hands after going to the toilet or changing a nappy and before eating. Anyone who has diarrhoea and vomiting should have their own towel to use. Babies or children who have diarrhoea and vomiting should be kept away from childcare or school for at least 48 hours after the last bout of diarrhoea or vomiting. Babies or children shouldn't swim in public swimming pools for two weeks after diarrhoea and vomiting has stopped. Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

The most common cause of vomiting in children and babies is gastroenteritis. This is an infection of the gut usually caused by a virus or bacteria, which also causes diarrhoea. The symptoms can be unpleasant but your child will usually start to feel better after a few days. However, persistent vomiting can sometimes cause your child to become severely dehydrated and occasionally it can be a sign of something more serious, such as meningitis. This page outlines what to do if your child keeps vomiting and describes some of the common causes of vomiting in children and babies. If your child has a high temperature, you can also read a separate page about fever in children. What to do If your child vomits, you should keep a close eye on them. Trust your instincts and contact your GP immediately if you're worried. If the cause is just a tummy bug, your child should still be feeling well enough to eat, play and be their usual self. In this case, keep feeding them as normal and offer them regular drinks (see below). But if they don't seem themself \u2013 for example, if they're floppy, irritable or less responsive \u2013 they may be seriously ill, so you should get medical help immediately. When to get medical advice You should contact your GP if: your child is repeatedly vomiting and is unable to hold down fluids you think they're dehydrated \u2013 symptoms of dehydration can include a dry mouth, crying without producing tears, urinating less or not wetting many nappies, and drowsiness their vomit is green or contains blood they have been vomiting for more than a day or two Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if your child is vomiting and develops sudden and severe tummy pain, or they're floppy, irritable or less responsive Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest A&E department immediately if they're vomiting and have a headache, stiff neck and a rash. Looking after your child at home In most cases, you can treat your child safely at home. The most important thing you can do is make sure they keep drinking fluids to prevent dehydration. If your baby is vomiting, carry on breastfeeding or giving them milk feeds. If they seem dehydrated, they will need extra fluids. Ask your GP or pharmacist whether you should give your baby oral rehydration solution. Oral rehydration solution is a special powder that you make into a drink. It contains sugar and salts to help replace the water and salts lost through vomiting and diarrhoea. Children who are vomiting should keep taking small sips of clear fluid, such as water or clear broth. Fruit juice and fizzy drinks should be avoided until they're feeling better. If they're not dehydrated and haven't lost their appetite, it's fine for your child to eat solid foods as normal. Again, speak to your GP or pharmacist if you're concerned about dehydration. They may recommend an oral rehydration solution for your child. Contact your GP or practice nurse if your child is unable to hold down oral rehydration solution. If your child has diarrhoea and is vomiting, they shouldn't go to school or any other childcare facility until 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea or vomiting. Read more about treating gastroenteritis in children. Causes of vomiting in children There are a number of possible causes of vomiting in children, which are described below. Gastroenteritis Gastroenteritis is an infection of the gut. It's a common cause of vomiting in children and usually lasts a few days. Food allergy Food allergies can cause vomiting in children, as well as other symptoms, such as a raised, red, itchy skin rash (urticaria) and swelling of the face, around the eyes, lips, tongue or the roof of the mouth. Watch out for foods that may bring on vomiting and see your GP for a diagnosis if you think your child may have a food allergy. Other infections Vomiting can sometimes be a sign of an infection other than gastroenteritis, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), middle ear infections, pneumonia or meningitis. Contact your child's GP if they're vomiting and experiencing additional symptoms of an infection, such as a high temperature (fever) and irritability. Appendicitis Appendicitis is a painful swelling of the appendix, a finger-like pouch connected to the large intestine. It causes severe tummy pain that gets worse over time. If your child has tummy pain that's gradually getting worse, contact your GP, local out-of-hours service or NHS 111 immediately. You should call 999 for an ambulance if they have pain that gets worse quickly and spreads across their tummy. In most cases of appendicitis, the appendix will need to be surgically removed as soon as possible. Poison Accidentally swallowing something poisonous can cause your child to vomit. If you think this is the case, contact your GP immediately or take your child to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Causes of vomiting in babies These include: gastroenteritis  a food allergy or milk intolerance gastro-oesophageal reflux \u2013 where stomach contents escape back up the gullet  too big a hole in the bottle teat, which causes your baby to swallow too much milk \u2013 read more bottle feeding advice accidentally swallowing something poisonous congenital pyloric stenosis \u2013 a condition present at birth where the passage from the stomach to the bowel has narrowed, so food is unable to pass through easily; this causes projectile vomiting a strangulated hernia \u2013 your baby will vomit frequently and cry as if they are in a lot of pain; this should be treated as a medical emergency intussusception (where the bowel telescopes in on itself) \u2013 as well as vomiting, your baby may look pale, floppy and have symptoms of dehydration Page last reviewed: 17\/04\/2015 Next review due: 17\/04\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Most deaths happen during the first six months of a baby\u2019s life. Infants born prematurely or with a low birthweight are at greater risk. SIDS also tends to be slightly more common in baby boys. SIDS usually occurs when a baby is asleep, although it can occasionally happen while they're awake. Parents can reduce the risk of SIDS by not smoking while pregnant or after the baby is born, and always placing the baby on their back when they sleep (see below). Find out how to stop smoking.  What causes SIDS? The exact cause of SIDS is unknown, but it's thought to be down to a combination of factors. Experts believe SIDS occurs at a particular stage in a baby\u2019s development, and that it affects babies who are vulnerable to certain environmental stresses. This vulnerability may be caused by being born prematurely or having a low birthweight, or because of other reasons not yet identified.  Environmental stresses could include tobacco smoke, getting tangled in bedding, a minor illness or a breathing obstruction. There's also an association between co-sleeping (sleeping with your baby on a bed, sofa or chair) and SIDS. Babies who die of SIDS are thought to have problems in the way they respond to these stresses and how they regulate their heart rate, breathing and temperature. Although the cause of SIDS isn't fully understood, there are a number of things you can do to reduce the risk. What can I do to help prevent SIDS? Below is a list of things you can do to help prevent SIDS. Do: Always place your baby on their back to sleep. Place your baby in the \"feet to foot\" position (with their feet touching the end of the cot, Moses basket, or pram). Keep your baby\u2019s head uncovered. Their blanket should be tucked in no higher than their shoulders. Let your baby sleep in a cot or Moses basket in the same room as you for the first six months. Use a mattress that's firm, flat, waterproof and in good condition. Breastfeed your baby (if you can). See Why breastfeed? for more information. Don't: Smoke during pregnancy or let anyone smoke in the same room as your baby (both before and after birth). Sleep on a bed, sofa or armchair with your baby. Share a bed with your baby if you or your partner smoke or take drugs, or if you've been drinking alcohol. Let your baby get too hot or too cold. A room temperature of 16-20C, with light bedding or a lightweight baby sleeping bag, will provide a comfortable sleeping environment for your baby. Read more about reducing the risk of SIDS. Seeking medical advice if your baby is unwell Babies often have minor illnesses, which you don't need to worry about. Give your baby plenty of fluids to drink and don't let them get too hot. If you're worried about your baby at any point, see your GP or call NHS 111 for advice. Dial 999 for an ambulance if your baby: stops breathing or turns blue is struggling for breath  is unconscious or seems unaware of what's going on won\u2019t wake up has a fit for the first time, even if they seem to recover Read more about spotting signs of serious illness in children. Support services If a baby dies suddenly and unexpectedly, there will need to be an investigation into how and why they died. A post-mortem examination will usually be necessary, which can be very distressing for the family. The police and healthcare professionals work closely to investigate unexpected infant deaths and ensure the family is supported. They should be able to put you in touch with local sources of help and support. Many people find talking to others who have had similar experiences helps them to cope with their bereavement. The Lullaby Trust provides advice and support for bereaved families. Specially trained advisers are available on their helpline. The number is 0808 802 6868 and it's open Monday to Friday (10am-5pm), and at weekends and public holidays (6pm-10pm). You can also visit their website for further information and support if you are bereaved. The Babyloss and Sands websites are useful resources for those affected by the death of a baby during pregnancy, at birth or shortly afterwards. Read more about bereavement. Information about your child If your baby was affected by SIDS, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Silica is a substance naturally found in certain types of stone, rock, sand and clay. Working with these materials can create a very fine dust that can be easily inhaled. Once inside the lungs, the dust particles are attacked by the immune system. This causes inflammation (swelling) and gradually leads to areas of hardened and scarred lung tissue (fibrosis). Lung tissue that\u2019s scarred in this way does not function properly. People who work in the following industries are particularly at risk: stone masonry and stone cutting \u2013 especially with sandstone construction and demolition \u2013 because of exposure to concrete and paving materials pottery, ceramics and glass manufacturing mining and quarrying sand blasting Signs and symptoms The symptoms of silicosis usually take many years to develop and you may not notice any problems until after you've stopped working with silica dust. The symptoms can also continue to get worse, even if you're no longer exposed. In most cases, exposure for at least 10-20 years is required to cause the condition, although in a few cases it can develop after 5-10 years of exposure or, in rare cases, after only a few months of very heavy exposure. Main symptoms The main symptoms of silicosis are: a persistent cough persistent shortness of breath weakness and tiredness If the condition continues to get worse, these symptoms may become more severe. Some people may eventually find simple activities such as walking or climbing stairs very difficult and may be largely confined to their house or bed. The condition can ultimately be fatal if the lungs stop working properly (respiratory failure) or serious complications develop (see below), but this is rare in the UK. Further problems Silicosis can also increase your risk of other serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, including: tuberculosis (TB) and other chest infections pulmonary hypertension heart failure arthritis  kidney disease  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  lung cancer  The links above will take you to more information on these conditions, including their treatment. How can my GP help? See your GP if you think there's a possibility you could have silicosis. Your GP may suspect the condition after asking about your symptoms and work history, and listening to your lungs with a stethoscope. They'll want to know about any periods when you may have been exposed to silica and whether you were issued with any safety equipment, such as a face mask, when you were working. If silicosis is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist for further tests to confirm the diagnosis. These tests can include: a chest X-ray to detect abnormalities in the structure of your lungs a computerised tomography (CT) scan of your chest, to produce more detailed images of your lungs  lung function testing (spirometry), which involves breathing into a machine called a spirometer to assess how well your lungs are working You may also be asked to have a test for TB, as you're more likely to get TB if you have silicosis. Treating silicosis There's no cure for silicosis, as the lung damage cannot be reversed. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. The condition may continue to get worse, leading to further lung damage and serious disability, although this may happen very slowly over many years. The following steps may limit the risk of complications: ensure you're not exposed to any more silica stop smoking (if you smoke) have regular test to check for TB, if advised by your doctor have the annual flu jab and the pneumococcal vaccination You may be offered long-term oxygen therapy if you're having difficulty breathing and have low levels of oxygen in your blood. Bronchodilator medicines may also be prescribed to widen your airways and make breathing easier. You'll be given a course of antibiotics if you develop a bacterial chest infection. In very severe cases, a lung transplant may be an option, although there are strict health requirements to meet before this will be considered. Preventing silicosis Silicosis can be prevented by avoiding prolonged exposure to silica dust. In the UK, all workplaces must now comply with The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002, which sets a workplace exposure limit for silica. Your employer should warn you about any risks to your health, make sure you're aware of the correct procedures to reduce your risk of exposure to silica dust, and supply you with the necessary equipment to protect you. You can read more detailed information about the control of exposure to silica dust (PDF, 99.5kb) on the Health and Safety Executive website. Claiming compensation If you've been diagnosed with silicosis, you may be able to claim compensation in one of the following ways: Industrial injuries disablement benefit \u2013 a sum of money paid weekly to people with silicosis who were exposed to silica while in employment (but not self-employment) and to people who have silicosis and lung cancer. Launch a civil claim for compensation through the courts (you'll need to get legal advice about how to do this). Claim a lump sum in compensation under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979 if you have silicosis, or you are the dependant of someone who has died from the condition and you haven't been able to get compensation through the courts because the employer who exposed you has stopped trading. You can read more detailed information about Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit on the GOV.UK website.

The diaphragm is a thin membrane of muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen (tummy). It is located underneath the ribcage and helps to control breathing. The medical name for hiccups is \"singultus\". What causes hiccups? Hiccups are very common and most people will get them at some point during their life. They can affect people of any age, including babies. Hiccups often occur without any obvious trigger, although short episodes have been linked with: drinking alcohol  smoking having a bloated stomach eating too quickly or eating spicy foods drinking hot or fizzy drinks emotions, such as stress, fear or excitement In rare cases, hiccups can last for a long time. If hiccups last for more than 48 hours they are known as \"persistent\" or \"protracted\" hiccups, and hiccups that last longer than a month are called \"intractable\" hiccups. These longer-lasting hiccups have been linked with a number of underlying medical conditions and some medications. Read more about the causes of hiccups. When to seek medical advice Hiccups are not usually serious and in most cases only last a few minutes. However, you should see your GP if you have hiccups that recur frequently or last longer than 48 hours so they can try to identify a possible cause and determine whether any further investigation or treatment is necessary. How hiccups are treated Most hiccups will pass quickly and won't need any specific treatment. If your hiccups are troublesome, there are some things you can do that may help, such as: sipping ice-cold water holding your breath for a short period biting on a lemon swallowing granulated sugar tasting vinegar pulling your knees up to your chest For longer-lasting hiccups, identifying and treating any identifiable cause may help, and there are also a number of medications that are sometimes used specifically to control hiccups.

They are felt as a dull, throbbing pain in the upper face. Many people assume they have a sinus headache, when in fact it's much more likely to be either a migraine or tension-type headache. It's important to see your GP if you have any type of bad headache that you cannot control with over-the-counter medicine, particularly if it lasts a week or more, so you can get a proper diagnosis and treatment. What causes sinus headaches? The sinuses are small air spaces in the skull, found behind the nose, eyes and cheeks. They open out into the nose, allowing mucus to drain and air to circulate normally. When the lining of the nose and upper airways becomes infected \u2013 for example, with a cold \u2013 the infection can spread to the sinuses and cause them to become swollen. The small opening from the sinuses to the nose can become blocked, which leads to a build-up of pressure inside the sinuses. This is known as sinusitis. For some people with sinusitis, the pressure builds up to such an extent that it causes pain, or a sinus headache. You may feel stuffy and congested for a while, but it normally gets better once the cold goes away. Sinusitis and sinus headaches can last much longer. This usually only happens if bacteria infect the trapped mucus, or your sinuses repeatedly swell up because of an allergy. Symptoms of a sinus headache A sinus headache is a constant, throbbing pain felt in the face (around the eyes, cheeks and forehead), usually only on one side. It tends to be at its worst first thing in the morning and may get better by the afternoon. The pain may get worse when you move your head, strain or bend down, and when you experience extreme changes in temperature (such as going from a warm room into freezing air outside). It can also spread to your teeth, upper jaw and other parts of your head. Your face may feel swollen and tender to the touch, and you will also have other symptoms of sinusitis, such as green or yellow mucus discharge from your nose and a high temperature (fever). The symptoms of a sinus headache can be very similar to those of a migraine and tension-type headache, so it can sometimes be hard to tell which you have, but sinus headaches occur with other sinusitis symptoms, such as fever and nasal discharge. Generally, if you have facial pain or a headache, but no other symptoms of sinusitis, you're more likely to have a migraine or tension-type headache. Treating a sinus headache If you have mild symptoms, you may be able to treat them at home by: resting and drinking plenty of fluids taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen using over-the-counter decongestant nasal sprays or drops to help unblock your nose \u2013 although these shouldn't be used for more than a week at a time holding a warm flannel to your affected sinuses for a few minutes, and repeating this several times a day flushing the inside of your nose with a saline nasal spray or solution available from your pharmacist \u2013 this can help to reduce swelling in the sinuses by cleaning out mucus, bacteria and any allergy-causing particles When to see your GP See your GP if your headache doesn't improve after a week, gets worse, or keeps coming back. Your GP may recommend: antibiotics \u2013 if a bacterial infection is thought to be the cause of your symptoms antihistamines \u2013 if an allergy is thought to be the cause of your symptoms corticosteroid sprays or drops to reduce the swelling in your sinuses In some cases, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist, who will carry out some tests to find the underlying cause of your symptoms. If no other treatments help, your ENT specialist may recommend surgery to improve the drainage of your sinuses. Read more about treating sinusitis.

It's usually caused by a viral infection and often improves within two or three weeks. The sinuses are small, air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead. The mucus produced by your sinuses usually drains into your nose through small channels. In sinusitis, these channels become blocked because the sinus linings are inflamed (swollen). Signs and symptoms Sinusitis usually occurs after an upper respiratory tract infection, such as a cold. If you have a persistent cold and develop the symptoms below, you may have sinusitis. Symptoms of sinusitis include: a green or yellow discharge from your nose a blocked nose pain and tenderness around your cheeks, eyes or forehead a sinus headache a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or more toothache a reduced sense of smell bad breath (halitosis) Children with sinusitis may be irritable, breathe through their mouth, and have difficulty feeding. Their speech may also sound nasal (as though they have a stuffy cold). The symptoms of sinusitis often clear up within a few weeks (acute sinusitis), although occasionally they can last three months or more (chronic sinusitis). When to see your GP If your symptoms are mild and getting better, you don't usually need to see your GP and can look after yourself at home. See your GP if: your symptoms are severe or getting worse your symptoms haven't started to improve after around 7-10 days you experience episodes of sinusitis frequently Your GP will usually be able to diagnose sinusitis from your symptoms and by examining the inside of your nose. If you have severe or recurrent sinusitis, they may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for further assessment. How sinusitis is treated Most people with sinusitis will feel better within two or three weeks and can look after themselves at home. You can help relieve your symptoms by: taking over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen using nasal decongestants \u2013 these shouldn't be used for more than a week, as this might make things worse holding warm packs to your face regularly cleaning the inside of your nose with a saline solution \u2013 you can make this at home yourself or use sachets of ingredients bought from a pharmacy If your symptoms aren't improving or are getting worse, your GP may prescribe antibiotics or corticosteroid spray or drops to see if they help. If your symptoms don't get better after trying these treatments, you may be referred to an ENT specialist for surgery to improve the drainage of your sinuses. Read more about treating sinusitis. What causes sinusitis? Sinusitis is usually the result of a cold or flu virus spreading to the sinuses from the upper airways. Only a few cases are caused by bacteria infecting the sinuses. An infected tooth or fungal infection can also occasionally cause the sinuses to become inflamed. It's not clear exactly what causes sinusitis to become chronic (long-lasting), but it has been associated with: allergies and related conditions, including allergic rhinitis, asthma and hay fever nasal polyps (growths inside the nose) smoking a weakened immune system Making sure underlying conditions such as allergies and asthma are well controlled may improve the symptoms of chronic sinusitis.

The effects of Sjögren's syndrome can be widespread. Certain glands become inflamed, which reduces the production of tears and saliva, causing the main symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome, which are dry eyes and dry mouth. In women (who are most commonly affected), the glands that keep the vagina moist can also be affected, leading to vaginal dryness. Read more about the symptoms of Sjögren\u2019s syndrome. What causes Sjögren's syndrome? Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune condition, which means that instead of protecting the body from infection or illness, the immune system reacts abnormally and starts attacking healthy cells and tissue. In Sjögren's syndrome, the immune system attacks the tear and saliva glands, and other secretory glands throughout the body. The reasons for this remains unknown, but research suggests that it's triggered by a combination of genetic, environmental and, possibly, hormonal factors. Some people are thought to be more vulnerable to the syndrome when they're born and that certain events, such an infection, can trigger the problems with the immune system. Read more about the causes of Sjögren\u2019s syndrome. Healthcare professionals classify Sjögren's syndrome as being either: primary \u2013 when the syndrome develops by itself and not as the result of another condition secondary \u2013 when the syndrome develops in combination with another autoimmune disorder, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis Diagnosing Sjögren's syndrome Sjögren's syndrome can be difficult to diagnose, because it has similar symptoms to other conditions and there is no single test for it. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and carry out a test to see how dry your mouth and eyes are. Read more about diagnosing Sjögren's syndrome. Treating Sjögren's syndrome There is no cure for Sjögren's syndrome, but treatments can help control symptoms. Dry eyes and mouth can usually be helped with artificial tears and saliva. It's important to maintain good eye and mouth hygiene, because your risk of developing an infection is greater. Taking care of your eyes and mouth can help prevent problems such as corneal ulcers and tooth decay. In severe cases, medication or surgery may be recommended. Read more about treating Sjögren's syndrome. Complications of Sjögren's syndrome Sjögren's syndrome can sometimes lead to complications. For example, your eyesight could be permanently damaged if the reduced tear production isn't treated. Sjögren's syndrome also increases your risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a cancer of the lymph glands. However, the chances are still low, at around 5%. Women with Sjögren's syndrome have an increased risk of having children with a temporary \"lupus\" rash or heart abnormalities. Any pregnancy will be closely monitored for potential problems. Read more about the complications of Sjögren\u2019s syndrome. Who's affected by Sjögren's syndrome? Sjögren's syndrome most commonly affects people aged 40-60, with women accounting for about 90% of cases. It\u2019s difficult to know exactly how many people are affected by the syndrome because many don't see their GP about their symptoms. However, Arthritis Research UK estimates that there may be up to half a million people in the UK who have Sjögren's syndrome. Information about you If you have Sjögren's syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

The most common sign of melanoma is the appearance of a new mole or a change in an existing mole. This can happen anywhere on the body, but the back, legs, arms and face are most commonly affected. In most cases, melanomas have an irregular shape and more than one colour. They may also be larger than normal moles and can sometimes be itchy or bleed. An \"ABCDE checklist\" has been developed for people to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma. Watch a visual guide to moles. Read more about the symptoms of melanoma. These pages mainly cover a type of melanoma known as superficial spreading melanoma, which accounts for around 70% of all melanomas in the UK. Other types of melanoma are summarised below. Nodular melanoma Nodular melanoma is a fast-developing type of melanoma, most common in middle-aged people. It may not develop from an existing mole and can appear in areas of skin that aren't regularly exposed to the sun. Lentigo maligna melanoma Lentigo maligna melanoma is most common in elderly people and those who have spent a lot of time outdoors. It is common on the face and tends to grow slowly over a number of years. Acral lentiginous melanoma  Acral lentiginous melanoma is a rare type of melanoma that usually appears on the palms of the hands and the soles or big toenails of the feet. This is the most common type of melanoma in people with dark skin. Cancer Research UK has more information about the different types of melanoma. Why does melanoma happen? Melanoma happens when some cells in the skin begin to develop abnormally. It is thought that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from natural or artificial sources may be partly responsible. Certain things can increase your chances of developing melanoma, such as having: lots of moles or freckles pale skin that burns easily red or blonde hair a family member who has had melanoma Read more about the causes of melanoma. Diagnosing melanoma See your GP if you notice any change to your moles. Your GP will refer you to a specialist clinic or hospital if they think you have melanoma. In most cases, a suspicious mole will be surgically removed and studied to see if it is cancerous. This is known as a biopsy. You may also have a test to check if melanoma has spread elsewhere in your body. This is known as a sentinel node biopsy. Read more about diagnosing melanoma. How is melanoma treated? The main treatment for melanoma is surgery, although your treatment will depend on your circumstances. If melanoma is diagnosed and treated at an early stage, surgery is usually successful. If melanoma isn't diagnosed until an advanced stage, treatment is mainly used to slow the spread of the cancer and reduce symptoms. This usually involves medicines, such as chemotherapy. Read more about treating melanoma. Once you have had melanoma, there is a chance it may return. This risk is increased if your cancer was widespread and severe. If your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your melanoma returning, you will probably need regular check-ups to monitor your health. You will also be taught how to examine your skin and lymph nodes to help detect melanoma if it returns. Who is affected Melanoma is the 5th most common cancer in the UK with around 13,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed each year. More than a quarter of cases are diagnosed in people under 50, which is unusual compared to most other types of cancer. It's also becoming more common in the UK over time, thought to be caused by increased exposure to UV light from the sun and sunbeds. More than 2,000 people die every year in the UK from melanoma. Can melanoma be prevented? Melanoma is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing it by limiting your exposure to UV light. You can help protect yourself from sun damage by using sunscreen and dressing sensibly in the sun. Sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided. Regularly checking your moles and freckles can help lead to an early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment. Read more about sunscreen and sun safety.

See your GP as soon as possible if you notice changes in a mole, freckle or patch of skin, especially if the changes happen over a few weeks or months. Signs to look out for include a mole that is: getting bigger changing shape changing colour bleeding or becoming crusty itchy or painful A helpful way to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma is the ABCDE checklist: Asymmetrical \u2013 melanomas have two very different halves and are an irregular shape. Border \u2013 melanomas have a notched or ragged border. Colours \u2013 melanomas will be a mix of two or more colours. Diameter \u2013 melanomas are larger than 6mm (1\/4 inch) in diameter. Enlargement or elevation \u2013 a mole that changes size over time is more likely to be a melanoma. Melanomas can appear anywhere on your body, but they most commonly appear on the back, legs, arms and face. They may sometimes develop underneath a nail. In rare cases, melanoma can develop in the eye. Noticing a dark spot or changes in vision can be signs, although it is more likely to be diagnosed during a routine eye examination. Want to know more?

Non-melanoma skin cancer refers to a group of cancers that slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin. The term 'non-melanoma' distinguishes these more common kinds of skin cancer from the less common skin cancer known as melanoma, which spreads faster in the body. The first sign of non-melanoma skin cancer is usually the appearance of a lump or patch on the skin that doesn't heal after a few weeks. In most cases, cancerous lumps are red and firm, while cancerous patches are often flat and scaly. See your GP if you have any skin abnormality that hasn't healed after four weeks. Although it is unlikely to be skin cancer, it is best to be sure. Read more about the symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer. Types of non-melanoma skin cancer Non-melanoma skin cancers usually develop in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis) and are often named after the type of skin cell from which they develop. The two most common types of non-melanoma skin cancer are: basal cell carcinoma \u2013 starts in the cells lining the bottom of the epidermis and accounts for about 75% of skin cancers squamous cell carcinoma \u2013 starts in the cells lining the top of the epidermis and accounts for about 20% of skin cancers Although not classed as non-melanoma skin cancers, actinic keratoses and Bowen's disease may sometimes develop into squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated. Why does it happen? Non-melanoma skin cancer is mainly caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light comes from the sun, as well as artificial sunbeds and sunlamps. In addition to UV light overexposure, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing non-melanoma skin cancer, such as: a family history of the condition pale skin that burns easily a large number of moles or freckles Read more about the causes of non-melanoma skin cancer. Who is affected? Non-melanoma skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. There are more than 100,000 new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer every year in the UK. Non-melanoma skin cancer affects slightly more men than women. Diagnosis Your GP can examine your skin for signs of skin cancer. They may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or a specialist plastic surgeon if they are unsure or suspect skin cancer. Your GP may refer you urgently, within two weeks, for squamous cell skin cancer. Basal cell skin cancers usually don't need an urgent referral but you should still see a specialist within 18 weeks. Read a guide to NHS waiting times. The specialist will examine your skin again and will perform a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of skin cancer. A biopsy is an operation that removes some affected skin so it can be studied under a microscope. Read more about diagnosing non-melanoma skin cancer. Treating non-melanoma skin cancer Surgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer. This involves removing the cancerous tumour and some of the surrounding skin. Other treatments for non-melanoma skin cancer include cryotherapy, creams, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and a treatment known as photodynamic therapy (PDT). Treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer is generally successful as, unlike most other types of cancer, there is a considerably lower risk that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body. It is estimated that basal cell carcinoma will spread to other parts of the body in less than 0.5% of cases. The risk is slightly higher in cases of squamous cell carcinoma, which spreads to other parts of the body in around 2-5% of cases. Treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer is completely successful in approximately 90% of cases. Read more about treating non-melanoma skin cancer. Complications If you have had non-melanoma skin cancer in the past, there is a chance the condition may return. The chance of non-melanoma skin cancer returning is increased if your previous cancer was widespread and severe. If your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your non-melanoma skin cancer returning, you will probably require regular check-ups to monitor your health. You will also be shown how to examine your skin to check for tumours. Prevention Non-melanoma skin cancer is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing the condition by avoiding overexposure to UV light. You can help protect yourself from sunburn by using sunscreen, dressing sensibly in the sun and limiting the time you spend in the sun during the hottest part of the day. Sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided. Regularly checking your skin for signs of skin cancer can help lead to an early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment.

The lump or discoloured patch is the cancer, sometimes referred to as a tumour. Non-melanoma skin cancer most often appears on areas of skin which are regularly exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, hands and shoulders. Basal cell carcinoma Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) usually appears as a small red or pink lump, although it can be pearly-white or 'waxy' looking. It can also look like a red, scaly patch. The lump slowly grows and may become crusty, bleed or develop into a painless ulcer. Squamous cell carcinoma Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) appears as a firm pink lump and may have a flat, scaly and crusted surface. The lump is often tender to touch, bleeds easily and may develop into an ulcer. Bowen's disease Bowen's disease is a very early form of skin cancer, sometimes referred to as \"squamous cell carcinoma in situ\". It develops slowly and is easily treated.  The main sign is a red, scaly patch on the skin which may itch. It most commonly affects elderly women and is often found on the lower leg. However, it can appear on any area of the skin. Read more about Bowen's disease. When to seek medical advice If you develop a lump, lesion or skin discolouration that hasn't healed after four weeks, see your GP. While it is unlikely to be cancer, it is best to be sure.

It's common and harmless, and may just go away without treatment. However, it can be hard to tell whether a lump is a cyst or something else that might need treatment. So, if you have any sort of lump, it's best to see your GP so it can be properly diagnosed. You can also read our page on lumps and swellings, to get a better idea of what your lump is. Some people confuse cysts with boils or skin abscesses. Boils and abscesses are painful collections of pus that indicate an infection. A cyst may go on to become a boil or abscess. This page covers everything you need to know about skin cysts. What does a cyst look like? A skin cyst looks like round, dome-shaped bump. It's yellow or whitish, often with a small dark plug through which you might be able to squeeze out pus. It can range in size from smaller than a pea to a few centimetres across, and grows slowly. Skin cysts don't usually hurt, but can become tender, sore and red if they become infected. Another sign of infection is foul-smelling pus coming out of it. Where are skin cysts found? Epidermoid cysts (one of the main types of cyst) are commonly found on the face, neck, chest, shoulders or skin around the genitals.  These cysts affect young and middle-aged adults, and are especially common in people with acne. They don't usually run in families. Some cysts form around the hair follicles. These are known as pilar cysts, and it's typical to find a few of these on the scalp. Unlike epidermoid cysts, pilar cysts strongly run in families. They typically affect middle-aged adults, and women more than men.  A cyst that forms on the eyelid is known as a chalazion, or meibomian cyst. Why do epidermoid and pilar cysts form? Some of the cells in the top layer of skin produce keratin, a protein that gives skin its strength and flexibility. Normally, these cells move up to the surface of the skin as they start to die, so they can be shed. But sometimes, these cells can move deeper into your skin and multiply, forming a sac. They secrete keratin into the middle of the sac, which forms a thick, yellow paste. This can ooze out of the cyst if it is burst. Anyone can develop a skin cyst, but you're more likely to have one if you've gone through puberty, you have a history of acne, or you have injured the skin (if you've damaged a hair follicle, for example). Skin cysts are not contagious. How are cysts treated? Cysts are usually harmless. If they're small and not bothering you, they can just be left alone. You might find it helps to hold a warm flannel against the skin, to encourage the cyst to heal and reduce any inflammation. Don't be tempted to pop the cyst, because if it's infected, you only risk spreading the infection and if the sac is left underneath the skin, it can grow back. If you think the cyst is infected, see your GP as you may need antibiotics. If the cyst is bothering you \u2013 for example, it's catching on your clothes or looks unpleasant \u2013 it can be removed. Your GP will use a local anaesthetic to numb your skin, make a tiny cut in the skin, and squeeze the cyst out. This procedure will leave a scar. Also, the cyst may still grow back at later date, especially if it was removed from the scalp or scrotum (pouch of skin containing the testicles).

It\u2019s usually used to improve the appearance of blemishes such as birthmarks and melasma (dark patches). Skin-lightening procedures work by reducing the concentration or production of melanin in the skin. Melanin is the pigment that gives skin its colour and helps protect it from the sun. The main techniques used to lighten the skin include: chemical peels  skin-lightening creams  laser treatment Trying a skin-lightening procedure is a major decision. It can be expensive, time-consuming, and the results can\u2019t be guaranteed. If you\u2019re thinking of going ahead, be absolutely sure about your reasons for wanting to try it and don\u2019t rush into it. It\u2019s a good idea to discuss your plans with your GP first. They might want to chat about your reasons for wanting to lighten your skin, and there might be a medical reason why the procedure isn't appropriate for you. Skin-lightening techniques can result in serious side effects and complications. People with darker skin tones are particularly at risk of these problems. Skin-lightening creams Powerful skin-lightening creams are available on prescription from a doctor. These usually contain one or both of the following medications: hydroquinone corticosteroids (steroid medication), such as hydrocortisone Products containing these ingredients that haven\u2019t been prescribed by a doctor are banned in the UK, as they can cause serious side effects if used incorrectly. For more information, read our article on the risks of skin-lightening creams. Products containing other potentially harmful substances such as mercury are also banned. Make sure you check the ingredients of any product before you buy it. Avoid it if hydroquinone, corticosteroids or mercury are listed in the ingredients, or if it doesn\u2019t come with a list of ingredients. Many alternative skin-lightening products containing natural ingredients are available online and in shops without prescription. These are legal and unlikely to be harmful, but there\u2019s no guarantee they work. How to use your skin-lightening cream Your doctor will advise you how to use your skin-lightening cream. You\u2019ll normally be advised to: use it sparingly once or twice a day on the darkened area of skin only avoid getting the cream on the surrounding skin or in your eyes, mouth and nose apply the cream with a cotton bud, or wash your hands thoroughly before and after applying the cream avoid touching the treated area against another person's skin for at least a few hours after applying the cream use sun cream to protect your skin from the aggravating effects of sunlight Most people will need to continue the treatment for around three or four months. Your doctor may recommend stopping treatment after this time, or only using it very occasionally. Possible side effects Side effects of skin-lightening creams can include: skin irritation and inflammation (redness and swelling) a burning or stinging sensation itchy and flaky skin What could go wrong Possible risks of creams containing hydroquinone, corticosteroids or mercury include: skin turning dark or too light thinning of the skin visible blood vessels in the skin scarring kidney, liver or nerve damage abnormalities in a newborn baby (if used during pregnancy) If you\u2019re prescribed skin-lightening cream by a doctor, they should let you know about the potential risks and how common these are. What to do if you have problems If you experience side effects while using a prescribed skin-lightening cream, contact the prescriber for advice. If you have any alarming symptoms that require urgent medical attention, such as a nasty rash, swelling or increasing pain, go to your local accident and emergency (A&E) department. Laser skin lightening A laser can also be used to lighten blemishes or dark patches of skin. This works by either removing the outer layer of skin or damaging the cells that produce melanin. The results of laser skin lightening tend to be quite variable. It may work for some people, while for others it may not have any effect, or the skin lightening may only be temporary. Cost Laser skin lightening isn\u2019t usually available on the NHS, so you\u2019ll normally have to pay for it privately. The cost of each session may vary widely across practitioners and is dependent on the size of the skin area, the extent of the lightening, and the equipment used. Several sessions are often needed to increase the chances of the procedure being effective. What it involves Before the procedure starts, a test may be carried out on a small area of skin to see how it reacts. If you don\u2019t experience any problems, you\u2019ll usually have your first session a few weeks later. You may experience a stinging or pricking sensation during the procedure, so a local anaesthetic cream may be used to numb your skin beforehand. During a session: you\u2019d be given special goggles to wear to protect your eyes from the laser a small hand-held laser device would be held against your skin \u2013 this may feel like a rubber band snapping at the skin a jet of cold air may be blown onto your skin to keep it cool throughout Each session will usually last around 30 minutes to an hour. You can go home when it\u2019s finished. Recovery It can take a week or two for your skin to recover from laser skin lightening. You may want to take a few days off work until your skin\u2019s appearance starts to improve. Your skin would normally be red and swollen for a few days, and may be bruised or crusty for a week or two. Over the next few weeks, your skin should start to fade to a lighter colour. It will be sensitive to the sun for up to six months. You can aid your recovery by: only washing the treated area gently with unperfumed soap and carefully dabbing it dry regularly applying aloe vera gel or petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline) to cool and soothe the treated area not picking at any scabs or crusts that develop taking painkillers such as paracetamol for any discomfort and holding an icepack to the skin to reduce any swelling applying sun cream to the treated area for at least six months to protect it from the aggravating effects of the sun Side effects to expect It\u2019s common after laser skin lightening to have: redness and swelling bruising crusting blistering These effects normally pass in a week or two. What could go wrong Serious complications of laser treatment are generally uncommon, but can include: scarring skin infection the skin turning darker or too light You should be told how likely these complications are, and what could be done about them if they occurred. What to do if you have problems Cosmetic procedures can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. If you have laser skin lightening and are not happy with the results, or think the procedure wasn't carried out properly, you should take up the matter with the hospital or clinic where you were treated. It is best that you go back to the practitioner who treated you if you have any complications. If this is not possible, you can go to your GP or local A&E department.

Most rashes are harmless and go away on their own. But if your baby has developed a rash and seems unwell, or if you're worried, see your GP to find out the cause and receive any necessary treatment. It's especially important to be aware of the symptoms of meningitis. This guide may give you a better idea of the cause of the rash, but don't use it to diagnose your baby's condition. Always see a GP for a proper diagnosis. This page covers the following common rashes in babies: Baby acne (neonatal acne)  Cradle cap  Eczema  Erythema toxicum (the \"normal newborn rash\")  Hand, foot and mouth disease  Sweat rash (miliaria)  Hives (urticaria)  Impetigo  Milia (blocked oil glands)  Nappy rash  Ringworm  Scabies  Slapped cheek syndrome  It also describes the warning signs of meningitis and explains what to do if you're worried about your baby. The causes of rashes in older children are covered separately. Baby acne (neonatal acne) Pimples sometimes develop on a baby's cheeks, nose and forehead within a month of their birth. These tend to get worse before clearing up completely after a few weeks or months. Washing your baby's face with water and a mild moisturiser can improve the appearance of their skin. Avoid acne medicines intended for older children and adults. Pimples or blackheads that develop after three months of age (infantile acne) tend to be more severe and often need medical treatment. Cradle cap Cradle cap is where yellowish, greasy, scaly patches develop on a baby's scalp. Occasionally, the face, ears and neck are also affected. Cradle cap isn't itchy and shouldn't bother your baby. If your baby is scratching or upset, they may have eczema (see below). Cradle cap is a common condition that tends to develop within two or three months after birth. It usually gets better without treatment in a few weeks or months. Gently washing your baby's hair and scalp with baby shampoo may help to prevent further patches developing. Read more about treating cradle cap. Eczema Eczema is a long-term condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. The most common form is atopic eczema, which mainly affects babies and children but can continue into adulthood. Eczema in babies under six months is sometimes associated with allergies to milk and egg. Atopic eczema often starts in young babies as a red, itchy rash on the face, scalp and body. As the child gets older, it usually starts to develop in areas with folds of skin, such as behind the knees or on the front of the elbows. Creams and ointments can often relieve the symptoms. Read more about managing your baby's eczema. Erythema toxicum Half of all newborns develop a blotchy red skin reaction called erythema toxicum, usually at two or three days old. It's a normal newborn rash that won't bother your baby and clears after a few days. Hand, foot and mouth disease Hand, foot and mouth disease is a common, viral illness that causes a blistery rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, as well as ulcers in the mouth. Your baby may also feel unwell and have a fever. Treatment isn't usually needed, as the baby's immune system clears the virus, and symptoms go away after about 7 to 10 days. If you're worried, see your GP. Hives (urticaria) Hives (also known as urticaria) is a raised, red itchy rash that appears on the skin. It happens when a trigger (such as a food that your baby is allergic to) causes a substance called histamine to be released into their skin. If your baby gets urticaria during feeding, the condition may be triggered by something they've had to eat or drink. The most common foods are egg and milk, but many other foods can sometimes be the cause. The urticaria rash is usually short-lived and can be controlled with antihistamines. Read more about treating hives. If your baby gets hives repeatedly, it's important to see your GP to discuss possible allergies. Impetigo Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the surface layers of the skin, which causes sores and blisters. It's not usually serious, but you can visit your GP for a prescription of antibiotics, which should clear the infection within 7 to 10 days. Read more about treating impetigo. Milia  About half of all newborns develop tiny (1-2mm) white spots, called milia, on their face. These are just blocked pores and usually clear within the first four weeks of life. Nappy rash Nappy rash occurs when the skin around the baby's nappy area becomes irritated. This is often caused by prolonged exposure to wee or poo, but can sometimes be the result of a fungal infection or rare skin condition. You can usually reduce nappy rash by taking simple steps to keep your baby's skin clean and dry, and using a barrier cream if needed. Antifungal cream may be necessary if the rash is caused by a fungal infection. Read more about nappies and nappy rash. Ringworm Ringworm is a common fungal skin infection that causes a ring-like red rash almost anywhere on the body (the baby's scalp, feet and groin are common areas). It's usually easily treated using over-the-counter creams. Read more about treating ringworm. Scabies Scabies is a common infestation of the skin that can affect people of all ages. It's caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin. It's often spread between family members, so when babies get scabies it's usually because someone else in the family had it recently. Babies with scabies develop tiny and very itchy spots all over the body, including on the soles of the feet, armpits and genital area. Treatment with creams that kill the scabies mite needs to be given to the whole family at the same time for it to be effective. Slapped cheek syndrome Slapped cheek syndrome is a viral infection particularly common in children and babies. It typically causes a bright red rash on both cheeks and a fever. Most babies won't need treatment, as slapped cheek syndrome is usually a mild condition that passes in a few days. Sweat rash (miliaria) A heat rash, sometimes called miliaria or prickly heat, may flare up when your baby sweats \u2013 for example, because they're dressed in too many clothes or the environment is hot and humid. It's a sign your baby's sweat glands have become blocked. They may develop tiny red bumps or blisters on their skin, but these will soon clear without treatment. Meningitis warning signs It's important to be aware of the warning signs of meningitis in your baby, which include: becoming floppy and unresponsive, or stiff with jerky movements becoming irritable and not wanting to be held unusual crying vomiting and refusing feeds pale and blotchy skin loss of appetite staring expression very sleepy with a reluctance to wake up fever  Some babies develop a swelling in the soft part of their head (fontanelle). Trust your instincts. If you think your baby has meningitis, see your GP immediately or go to your nearest accident & emergency (A&E) department.  Page last reviewed: 02\/07\/2015 Next review due: 02\/07\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Most rashes are harmless and disappear without the need for treatment. However, see your GP if your child has a rash and seems unwell, or if you're worried. They'll be able to investigate the cause and recommend any necessary treatment. This page may give you a better idea about what could be causing the rash, but don't use this to self-diagnose your child's condition \u2013 always see a GP for a proper diagnosis. The most common causes of rashes in children are: cellulitis chickenpox  eczema erythema multiforme  hand, foot and mouth disease   impetigo keratosis pilaris (\"chicken skin\") measles molluscum contagiosum pityriasis rosea prickly heat psoriasis ringworm  scabies scarlet fever  slapped cheek syndrome urticaria (hives)  The skin rash of meningitis is also covered on the page. Although meningitis has become less common over recent years, it's important to be aware of the rash and the other signs and symptoms of meningitis. The causes of skin rashes in babies have a separate page. Cellulitis Cellulitis is an infection of the deeper layers of skin and underlying tissue. The affected area will be red, painful, swollen and hot. It often affects the legs, but can occur anywhere on the body. Your child will probably also have a fever. See your GP immediately if an area of your child's skin suddenly turns red, hot and tender. If you can't see your GP on the same day, go to a walk-in centre or minor injuries unit. Cellulitis can usually be diagnosed by assessing the symptoms and examining the skin. It usually responds well to treatment with antibiotics. Chickenpox  Chickenpox is a viral illness that most children catch at some point. It most commonly affects children under 10 years of age. A rash of itchy spots turns into fluid-filled blisters. They crust over to form scabs, which after a while drop off. Some children only have a few spots, whereas others have them over their entire body. The spots are most likely to appear on the face, ears and scalp, under the arms, on the chest and belly, and on the arms and legs. There's no specific treatment for chickenpox, but you can take steps to relieve the symptoms. For example, paracetamol can help relieve fever (don't give aspirin to children under 16), and calamine lotion and cooling gels can be used to ease itching. Read more about treating chickenpox. Eczema Eczema is a long-term condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. The most common type is atopic eczema, which mainly affects children but can continue into adulthood. Atopic eczema commonly develops behind the knees or on the elbows, neck, eyes and ears. It isn't a serious condition, but if your child later becomes infected with the herpes simplex virus, it can cause the eczema to flare up into an outbreak of tiny blisters called eczema herpeticum, and will cause a fever. About one in five children in the UK has eczema, and in eight out 10 cases it develops before the age of five, often before a child's first birthday.  Read about treating atopic eczema. Erythema multiforme  Erythema multiforme is a skin rash (usually mild) that's caused by an allergic reaction to the herpes simplex virus. The spots look like targets, with a dark red centre and paler ring around the outside. The hands or feet tend to be affected first, followed by the limbs, upper body and face. Your child will probably feel unwell and may have a fever, which you should be able to treat with over-the-counter medicine. It may take from two to six weeks before they feel better. See your GP if your child has a rash and seems unwell. In rare cases, erythema multiforme can be triggered by a reaction to certain medications, such as an antibiotic or anticonvulsant. This more severe form is called Stevens-Johnson syndrome and it can be life-threatening. Hand, foot and mouth disease  Hand, foot and mouth disease is a common, contagious infection that causes mouth ulcers and spots and blisters on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It's most common in young children (particularly those under 10), but it can also affect older children and adults. There's no cure for hand, foot and mouth disease and it's easily spread, so you should keep your child away from school or nursery until they're better. Your child's immune system will fight the virus and it should clear up after about seven to 10 days. Make sure your child drinks plenty of fluid, and if eating and swallowing is uncomfortable, give them soft foods, such as mashed potatoes, yoghurt and soup. Impetigo Impetigo is a common and highly contagious skin infection that causes sores and blisters. It isn't usually serious and often improves within a week of treatment. There are two types of impetigo \u2013 bullous and non-bullous. Bullous impetigo typically affects the trunk (the area of the body between the waist and neck), and causes fluid-filled blisters that burst after a few days to leave a yellow crust. Non-bullous impetigo typically affects the skin around the nose and mouth, causing sores that quickly burst to leave a yellow-brown crust. See your GP if you think your child has impetigo. Antibiotics, in the form of a cream or tablets, will be prescribed. This should reduce the length of the illness to around seven to 10 days. Keratosis pilaris (\"chicken skin\") Keratosis pilaris is a common and harmless skin condition. The skin on the back of the upper arms becomes rough and bumpy, as if covered in permanent goose pimples. Sometimes, the buttocks, thighs, forearms and upper back can also be affected. Keratosis pilaris typically begins in childhood and gets worse during puberty. Some people find it improves after this and may even disappear in adulthood. There's no cure for keratosis pilaris, and it often gets better on its own without treatment. However, there are some measures you can take that may improve your child's rash, such as using non-soap cleansers rather than soap, and an emollient to moisturise their skin. Your GP or pharmacist will be able to recommend a suitable cream. Measles Measles is a highly infectious illness that most commonly affects young children. It's now rare in the UK because of the effectiveness of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The measles rash is red-brown blotches. It usually starts on the head or upper neck and then spreads outwards to the rest of the body. Your child may also have a fever and cold-like symptoms. Call your GP surgery immediately if you think your child has measles. It's best to phone before visiting because the surgery may need to make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others. Measles usually passes in about seven to 10 days without causing further problems. Paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to relieve fever, aches and pains (don't give aspirin to children under 16). Also, make sure your child drinks plenty of water to avoid dehydration. Read more about treating measles. Molluscum contagiosum Molluscum contagiosum is a viral skin infection that causes clusters of small, firm, raised spots to develop on the skin. It commonly affects young children aged one to five years, who tend to catch it after close physical contact with another infected child. The condition is usually painless, although some children may experience some itchiness. It usually goes away within 18 months without the need for treatment. Molluscum contagiosum is highly infectious. However, most adults are resistant to the virus, which means they're unlikely to catch it if they come into contact with it. Pityriasis rosea Pityriasis rosea is a relatively common skin condition that causes a temporary rash of raised, red scaly patches to develop on the body. Most cases occur in older children and young adults (aged between 10 and 35). The rash can be very itchy. In most cases, it clears up without treatment in 2 to 12 weeks, although in rare cases it can last up to five months. Emollients, steroid creams and antihistamines can be used to help relieve the itchiness. The rash doesn't usually leave scars, although the skin can sometimes be discoloured afterwards. Read more about the treating pityriasis rosea. Prickly heat (heat rash) Prickly heat (heat rash), also known as miliaria, is an itchy rash of small, raised red spots that causes a stinging or prickly sensation on the skin. It occurs when the sweat ducts in the outer layer of skin (epidermis) are obstructed. You can get a heat rash anywhere on your body, but the face, neck, back, chest or thighs are most often affected. Infants can sometimes get a prickly heat rash if they sweat more than usual \u2013 for example, when it's hot and humid or if they're overdressed. It isn't a serious condition and rarely requires any specific treatment. Psoriasis Psoriasis is a long-lasting (chronic) skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales. The severity of psoriasis varies greatly from person to person. For some people, it's just a minor irritation, but for others it can have a major impact on their quality of life.  There's no cure for psoriasis, but there are a number of treatments that can help improve the symptoms and appearance of skin patches. For example, topical corticosteroids are creams and ointments that can be applied to the skin. Ringworm Ringworm is a highly infectious fungal skin infection that causes a ring-like red or silvery patch on the skin that can be scaly, inflamed or itchy. Ringworm often affects the arms and legs, but it can appear almost anywhere on the body. Other similar fungal infections can affect the scalp, feet, groin and nails. Ringworm can usually be easily treated with antifungal medicines, which are available from a pharmacy. Ringworm of the scalp can cause scaling and patches of hair loss. It's treated with antifungal tablets, often combined with antifungal shampoo. Scabies Scabies is a contagious skin condition that's intensely itchy. It's caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin. In children, scabies is usually spread through prolonged periods of skin-to-skin contact with an infected adult or child \u2013 for example, during play fighting or hugging. The mites like warm places, such as skin folds, between the fingers, under fingernails, or around the buttock creases. They leave small red blotches, which are often found on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. In infants, blisters are commonly found on the soles of the feet.  See your GP if you think your child has scabies. It's not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated. Your GP will prescribe a lotion or cream. Read more about treating scabies. Scarlet fever Scarlet fever is a highly contagious bacterial infection that usually affects children between two and eight years of age. It causes a distinctive pink-red rash, which feels like sandpaper to touch and may be itchy. It often starts with a sore throat, fever and headache, with the rash developing two to five days after infection. The rash usually occurs on the chest and stomach before spreading to other areas of the body, such as the ears and neck. Scarlet fever usually clears up after about a week, but see your GP if you think your child may have it. Antibiotics are used to treat it (liquid antibiotics, such as penicillin or amoxicillin, are often used to treat children). Slapped cheek syndrome Slapped cheek syndrome \u2013 also known as fifth disease or parvovirus B19 \u2013 is a viral infection that's common in children aged six to 10. It causes a distinctive bright red rash to develop on both cheeks. This can look alarming, but it usually clears up by itself in one to three weeks. Unless your child is feeling unwell, they don't need to stay away from school. Once the rash appears, the infection is no longer contagious. However, it's a good idea to notify your child's school about the infection. Urticaria (hives) Urticaria \u2013 also known as hives, weals, welts or nettle rash \u2013 is a raised, itchy rash that can affect one part of the body or be spread across large areas. It's a common skin reaction that often affects children. Urticaria occurs when a trigger causes high levels of histamine and other chemical messengers to be released in the skin. These substances cause the blood vessels in the skin to open up, resulting in redness or pinkness, and swelling and itchiness. There are many possible triggers of urticaria, including allergens, such as food or latex, irritants, such as nettles, medicines, and physical factors, such as heat or exercise. Sometimes, a cause can't be identified. The rash is usually short-lived and mild, and can often be controlled with antihistamines. Meningitis Meningitis is an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (meninges). The classic rash associated with meningitis usually looks like small, red pinpricks at first. It then quickly spreads over the body and turns into red or purple blotches. Seek immediate medical advice if, upon pressing the side of a clear glass firmly against the skin, the rash doesn't fade (see image above). Read more about the symptoms of meningitis. You can also use the meningitis symptom alert to help you recognise the signs, which includes a printable checklist.

They're very common and harmless. Skin tags can vary in size from a few millimetres up to 5cm wide. They're usually found on the neck, armpits, around the groin, or under the breasts. They can also grow on the eyelids or under the folds of the buttocks. Why skin tags occur Anyone can develop skin tags, but they're particularly common in older people and people with diabetes. Pregnant women may be more likely to develop skin tags, caused by changes in their hormone levels. Some people develop them for no apparent reason. Skin tags tend to grow where skin rubs against skin or clothing. This would explain why they also tend to affect overweight people or younger children who have excess folds of skin and skin chafing. When skin tags can be a problem Skin tags are harmless and don't usually cause pain or discomfort.  However, you may want to consider getting them removed if they are unsightly and affect your self-esteem, or if they snag on clothing or jewellery and bleed. You'll usually need to pay for this procedure privately. This is because the removal of skin tags is regarded as cosmetic surgery, which is rarely available through the NHS. Generally, the NHS will only carry out cosmetic surgery procedures if the problem is affecting your physical or mental health. Sometimes, skin tags fall off on their own if the tissue has twisted and died from a lack of blood supply. Removing skin tags If a skin tag is upsetting you, consider making an appointment with a privately practising GP to have it removed. Skin tags can easily be burnt or frozen off in a similar way to how warts are removed. They can also be surgically removed, sometimes using local anaesthetic. If your skin tag is small with a narrow base, the GP may suggest you try removing it yourself by: tying off the base of the skin tag with dental floss or cotton to cut off its blood supply and make it drop off cutting it off with fine sterile scissors Don't attempt to remove large skin tags yourself because they will bleed heavily. Skin tag or wart? Here's how to tell the difference: Skin tags are smooth and soft, whereas warts tend to be rougher with an irregular surface. Skin tags are knobbly and hang off the skin, whereas warts are usually flat. Skin tags aren't contagious, but warts spread very easily, so a sudden outbreak or cluster of growths is more likely to be warts. Read more about warts.

It can be a sign of a serious problem, so it's important to seek medical advice. When blood becomes depleted of oxygen, it changes from bright red to darker in colour, and it's this that makes the skin and lips look blue. In darker-skinned people, the blue tinge may be easier to spot in the lips, gums and around the eyes. The medical name for this blue tinge is cyanosis. What to do Call 999 or go to your nearest hospital emergency department (A&E) immediately if you notice an adult or child suddenly turning blue, particularly if they have other symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or chest pain. This could be a sign of a life-threatening problem. See your GP or call NHS 111 if you have cyanosis that comes on very gradually, or affects just the fingers, hands, toes or feet. This is usually the result of a less serious problem with blood circulation, but it should still be checked by a doctor. Common causes of cyanosis Some of the main causes of cyanosis are described below, but you shouldn't use this to diagnose yourself \u2013 always leave that to a doctor. Cyanosis that just affects the hands, feet or limbs If just the fingers, toes or limbs have turned blue and feel cold, it's known as \"peripheral cyanosis\".

It is an impulse-control disorder \u2013 a psychological condition where the person is unable to stop themselves carrying out a particular action. Do I have it? A person with dermatillomania will habitually and excessively pick, scratch, gouge or squeeze at otherwise healthy skin. They usually pick at the skin on their face and lips, but it can be any area of the body, such as the hands, scalp or arms. They may pick at normal skin features such as freckles or moles, or at imaginary skin defects that no-one else can see. They might pick with their fingernails, or use tools such as pins or tweezers. The result is often bleeding or bruising, which carries a risk of infection and scars. Emotions A person with dermatillomania will experience intense emotions as part of their compulsion.  It's typical to experience an intense urge to pick the skin, with increasing tension until they do. After picking, there is a sense of relief. Dermatillomania can cause negative feelings, such as guilt, shame and embarrassment. It's common to try to deny it or cover up the skin with make-up. A person with dermatillomania may feel unattractive and develop low self-esteem, avoiding others. Who develops dermatillomania? Impulse-control disorders in general are more common among teenagers and young adults.  Dermatillomania tends to develop in the teenage years or early 20s, and affects more girls than boys. It might start as a habit, then become uncontrollable. It is regarded as a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Learn about the causes of OCD. Why does dermatillomania happen? It's not known what causes dermatillomania, but there are several theories. Some experts think it is a type of addiction. The more you pick your skin, the more you want to keep doing it. Dermatillomania may be a reflection of a mental health problem. Psychological and behavioural theories suggest that skin picking may be a way of relieving stress or anxiety. In some cases, dermatillomania may be a form of self-harm, where you deliberately injure yourself as a way of seeking temporary relief from emotional distress. Another very similar disorder is trichotillomania \u2013 where a person compulsively pulls their hair out. It's not uncommon for someone to have OCD and to both compulsively pick at their skin and pull their hair out. What should I do? See your GP if you're compulsively picking your skin or if you notice your child doing so. Your GP can refer you to a psychologist or psychiatrist for a form of talking therapy. You may need to be referred to a dermatologist (skin specialist) first, if the skin is badly damaged. Talking therapy for dermatillomania Little medical research has been conducted into treatments for dermatillomania. The most effective treatment is therapy to change your skin-picking behaviour, combined with a network of emotional support. Psychotherapy is a type of talking therapy that can be used to treat emotional problems and mental health conditions. It involves discussing emotional issues with a trained therapist. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that may be recommended. It helps you to manage your problems by changing how you think and act. CBT often involves behavioural therapy, also known as habit-reversal therapy, which aims to change your behaviour \u2013 in this case, reducing your skin picking. First, you learn how to become more consciously aware of situations and events that may trigger your skin picking. Then, you'll learn to use alternative behaviours as a response. You may be asked to keep a record of when, where and under what circumstances you normally pick. The aim is to replace the harmful skin-picking habit with a habit that is harmless. Tips for quitting Occupy your hands with something else until the urge passes, or put on gloves. When tempted to pick, care for your skin instead \u2013 for example, apply moisturiser. Aim to hold off the urge for longer and longer each time if you can't resist it altogether.  Keep skin clean to avoid infection. Stay busy. Get rid of tweezers, pins and any other instrument you might be tempted to use. Try squeezing a soft ball or playing with blue tack instead. Support If you have dermatillomania, it's important that you receive emotional help and support. This can be from family, friends or self-help groups. Organisations such as OCD UK are good places to start if you're looking for support. See the \"Useful links\" on this page for more contacts.

It usually causes a bright red rash on the cheeks. Although the rash can look alarming, slapped cheek syndrome is normally a mild infection that clears up by itself in one to three weeks. Once you've had the infection, you're usually immune to it for life. However, slapped cheek syndrome can be more serious for some people. If you're pregnant, have a blood disorder or a weakened immune system and have been exposed to the virus, you should get medical advice. This page covers: Symptoms When to get medical advice What to do if you or your child has it How you get it Prevention Symptoms of slapped cheek syndrome Symptoms of slapped cheek syndrome usually develop 4-14 days after becoming infected, but sometimes may not appear for up to 21 days. Initial symptoms Some people with slapped cheek syndrome won't notice any early symptoms, but most people will have the following symptoms for a few days: a slightly high temperature (fever) of around 38C (100.4F) a runny nose  a sore throat a headache an upset stomach feeling generally unwell The infection is most contagious during this initial period. In adults, these symptoms are often accompanied by joint pain and stiffness, which may continue for several weeks or even months after the other symptoms have passed. Slapped cheek rash After a few days, a distinctive bright red rash on both cheeks (the so-called \"slapped cheeks\") normally appears, although adults may not get this. By the time this rash develops, the condition is no longer contagious. After another few days, a light pink rash may also appear on the chest, stomach, arms and thighs. This often has a raised, lace-like appearance and may be itchy. The rashes will normally fade within a week or two, although occasionally the body rash may come and go for a few weeks after the infection has passed. This can be triggered by exercise, heat, anxiety or stress. When to get medical advice You don't usually need to see your GP if you think you or your child has slapped cheek syndrome, as the condition normally gets better on its own. However, you should contact your GP, call NHS 111 or contact your local out-of-hours service if you have been exposed to anyone with slapped cheek or you have symptoms of the infection and: you're pregnant \u2013 infection in pregnancy, particularly early pregnancy, carries a risk of causing miscarriage, stillbirth or other complications; however, this risk is small and most pregnant women will already be immune (read more about the risks of slapped cheek syndrome in pregnancy) you have a blood disorder, such as sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia, or a weakened immune system \u2013 the infection can cause severe anaemia that may need to be treated in hospital you have symptoms of severe anaemia, such as very pale skin, severe shortness of breath, extreme tiredness or fainting In these cases, a blood test may be carried out to see if you're immune to the infection. If you're not immune, you'll be monitored carefully to check for any problems. If you develop severe anaemia, it's likely that you'll need to be admitted to hospital and have a blood transfusion to replace your damaged blood cells. What to do if you or your child has slapped cheek Slapped cheek syndrome is usually mild and should clear up without specific treatment. If you or your child is feeling unwell, you can try the following to ease the symptoms: rest and drink plenty of fluids \u2013 babies should continue their normal feeds for a fever, headaches or joint pain, you can take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen \u2013 children under 16 shouldn't take aspirin to reduce itchiness, you can take antihistamines or use an emollient (moisturising lotion) \u2013 some antihistamines are not suitable for young children, so check with your pharmacist first Unless you or your child is feeling unwell, there\u2019s no need to stay away from school or work once the rash has developed, as the infection is no longer contagious by this point. It's a good idea to notify your child's school about the infection, so children who develop early symptoms can be spotted quickly and vulnerable people can be made aware that they may need to get medical advice. How do you get slapped cheek syndrome? Slapped cheek syndrome is caused by a virus called parvovirus B19. This is found in the droplets in the coughs and sneezes of someone with the infection. The virus is spread in a similar way to colds and flu. You can become infected by:  inhaling droplets that are sneezed or coughed out by someone with the infection touching a contaminated surface or object and then touching your mouth or nose Someone with slapped cheek syndrome is infectious during the period before the rash develops. Once the rash appears, the condition can no longer be passed on. Preventing slapped cheek syndrome It's very difficult to prevent slapped cheek syndrome, because people who have the infection are most contagious before they develop any obvious symptoms. However, making sure that everyone in your household washes their hands frequently may help stop the infection from spreading. There's currently no vaccine available to protect you against the condition.

This may lead to regularly interrupted sleep, which can have a big impact on quality of life and increases the risk of developing certain conditions. This topic covers: Apnoea and hypopnoea Symptoms When to seek medical advice Causes Treatments Complications Prevention Apnoea and hypopnoea There are two types of breathing interruption characteristic of OSA: apnoea \u2013 where the muscles and soft tissues in the throat relax and collapse sufficiently to cause a total blockage of the airway; it's called an apnoea when the airflow is blocked for 10 seconds or more hypopnoea \u2013 a partial blockage of the airway that results in an airflow reduction of greater than 50% for 10 seconds or more People with OSA may experience repeated episodes of apnoea and hypopnoea throughout the night. These events may occur around once every one or two minutes in severe cases. As many people with OSA experience episodes of both apnoea and hypopnoea, doctors sometimes refer to the condition as obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome, or OSAHS. The term \"obstructive\" distinguishes OSA from rarer forms of sleep apnoea, such as central sleep apnoea, which is caused by the brain not sending signals to the breathing muscles during sleep. Symptoms of OSA The symptoms of OSA are often first spotted by a partner, friend or family member who notices problems while you sleep. Signs of OSA in someone sleeping can include: loud snoring noisy and laboured breathing repeated short periods where breathing is interrupted by gasping or snorting Some people with OSA may also experience night sweats and may wake up frequently during the night to urinate. During an episode, the lack of oxygen triggers your brain to pull you out of deep sleep \u2013 either to a lighter sleep or to wakefulness \u2013 so your airway reopens and you can breathe normally. These repeated sleep interruptions can make you feel very tired during the day. You'll usually have no memory of your interrupted breathing, so you may be unaware you have a problem. When to seek medical advice See your GP if you think you might have OSA. They can check for other possible reasons for your symptoms and can arrange for an assessment of your sleep to be carried out through a local sleep centre. As someone with OSA may not notice they have the condition, it often goes undiagnosed. Read more about diagnosing OSA. Causes of OSA It's normal for the muscles and soft tissues in the throat to relax and collapse to some degree while sleeping. For most people this doesn't cause breathing problems. In people with OSA the airway has narrowed as the result of a number of factors, including: being overweight \u2013 excessive body fat increases the bulk of soft tissue in the neck, which can place a strain on the throat muscles; excess stomach fat can also lead to breathing difficulties, which can make OSA worse being male \u2013 it's not known why OSA is more common in men than in women, but it may be related to different patterns of body fat distribution being 40 years of age or more \u2013 although OSA can occur at any age, it's more common in people who are over 40 having a large neck \u2013 men with a collar size greater than around 43cm (17 inches) have an increased risk of developing OSA taking medicines with a sedative effect \u2013 such as sleeping tablets or tranquillisers having an unusual inner neck structure \u2013 such as a narrow airway, large tonsils, adenoids or tongue, or a small lower jaw alcohol \u2013 drinking alcohol, particularly before going to sleep, can make snoring and sleep apnoea worse smoking \u2013 you're more likely to develop sleep apnoea if you smoke the menopause (in women) \u2013 the changes in hormone levels during the menopause may cause the throat muscles to relax more than usual having a family history of OSA \u2013 there may be genes inherited from your parents that can make you more susceptible to OSA nasal congestion \u2013 OSA occurs more often in people with nasal congestion, such as a deviated septum, where the tissue in the nose that divides the two nostrils is bent to one side, or nasal polyps, which may be a result of the airways being narrowed Treating OSA OSA is a treatable condition, and there are a variety of treatment options that can reduce the symptoms. Treatment options for OSA include: lifestyle changes \u2013 such as losing excess weight, cutting down on alcohol and sleeping on your side using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device \u2013 these devices prevent your airway closing while you sleep by delivering a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask wearing a mandibular advancement device (MAD) \u2013 this gum shield-like device fits around your teeth, holding your jaw and tongue forward to increase the space at the back of your throat while you sleep Surgery may also be an option if OSA is thought to be the result of a physical problem that can be corrected surgically, such as an unusual inner neck structure. However, for most people surgery isn't appropriate and may only be considered as a last resort if other treatments haven't helped. Read more about treating OSA. Complications of OSA The treatments mentioned above can often help control the symptoms of OSA, although treatment will need to be lifelong in most cases. If OSA is left untreated, it can have a significant impact on your quality of life, causing problems such as poor performance at work and school, and placing a strain on your relationships with others. Poorly controlled OSA may also increase your risk of: developing high blood pressure (hypertension) having a stroke or heart attack developing an irregular heartbeat \u2013 such as atrial fibrillation developing type 2 diabetes \u2013 although it's unclear if this is the result of an underlying cause, such as obesity Research has shown someone who has been deprived of sleep because of OSA may be up to 12 times more likely to be involved in a car accident. If you're diagnosed with OSA, it may mean your ability to drive is affected. It's your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about a medical condition that could have an impact on your driving ability. Once a diagnosis of OSA has been made, you shouldn't drive until your symptoms are well controlled. The GOV.UK website has advice about how to tell the DVLA about a medical condition. Preventing OSA It's not always possible to prevent OSA, but making certain lifestyle changes may reduce your risk of developing the condition. These include: losing weight if you're overweight or obese limiting how much alcohol you drink and avoiding alcohol in the evening stopping smoking if you smoke avoiding the use of sleeping tablets and tranquillisers Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 14\/07\/2016 Next review due: 14\/07\/2019 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Although you're awake, your body is briefly paralysed, after which you can move and speak as normal. The paralysis can last from a few seconds to several minutes. Sleep paralysis doesn't cause you any harm, but being unable to move can be very frightening. Some people have sleep paralysis once or twice in their life, while others experience it a few times a month or more regularly. Sleep paralysis can affect people of all ages, but it's more common in teenagers and young adults. Men and women are equally affected. Read about the symptoms of sleep paralysis. What causes sleep paralysis? It's normal for your muscles to be paralysed at certain times when you're asleep. Sleep paralysis occurs when the mechanism that causes your muscles to relax during sleep temporarily persists after you've woken up. Sleep paralysis can sometimes be a symptom of narcolepsy. This is a relatively rare sleep disorder, which causes severe disruption to the sleep-wake cycle. An inability to stay awake for more than three or four hours is usually the main symptom. Other things that increase your risk of getting sleep paralysis include: sleep deprivation irregular sleeping patterns age \u2013 it's more common in teenagers and young adults Read more about the causes of sleep paralysis. Getting help If you have sleep paralysis, your GP may be able to suggest ways that you can improve your sleep, such as keeping to a regular sleeping routine and creating a restful sleeping environment. If your symptoms are severe or possibly linked to another sleep-related condition, such as narcolepsy, your GP may refer you to a sleep disorder specialist (see below). Treating sleep paralysis The symptoms of sleep paralysis can often be improved by altering your sleep habits and sleeping environment. Sleep paralysis often affects people who are sleep deprived, so ensuring you get enough sleep may reduce the number of episodes you have. Most adults need six to eight hours of good quality sleep each night. Going to bed at roughly the same time each night and getting up at the same time each morning may also help. Read more about how to improve your sleep habits. See your GP if your sleep paralysis is particularly severe. They may refer you to a specialist, such as a neurologist. A short course of antidepressant medication, such as clomipramine, may be prescribed to treat severe sleep paralysis. Read more about treating sleep paralysis.

It can have many possible causes, including conditions such as narcolepsy, sleep apnoea or restless legs syndrome; severe sleep deprivation; depression; certain medications (such as tranquillisers); or drug and alcohol misuse. However, some people with hypersomnia will not have an underlying medical condition and there will be no obvious explanation for it \u2013 they have it throughout the day, despite sleeping for a very long time at night. This is known as \"idiopathic\" or primary hypersomnia. The rest of this page focuses on idiopathic hypersomnia.  Signs and symptoms People with idiopathic hypersomnia struggle to stay awake during the day and are usually compelled to take frequent long naps. These may be prolonged or at inappropriate times \u2013 such as during a conversation or meal, or even while driving \u2013 and generally don't provide any relief from the sleepiness. Most people with idiopathic hypersomnia also sleep for more than 10 hours a night and struggle to wake in the morning, because they feel very drowsy and confused upon waking (\"sleep drunkenness\"), although some people sleep for a regular amount of time (about eight hours) and are able to wake relatively normally. The excessive sleepiness may have a negative impact on the person's work, relationships and social life, and they may also: have mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression  have low energy be restless or agitated think or speak slowly have trouble remembering things or maintaining concentration perform behaviours around the house as if on \u201Cautopilot\u201D These symptoms often develop during adolescence or in a person's early twenties, although they can occur earlier or later in life. What to do See your GP if you're constantly drowsy during the day and it's affecting your everyday life. They'll want to know about your sleeping habits, how much sleep you get at night, if you wake during the night, and whether you fall asleep during the day. They will also want to know if you have any emotional problems, such as depression, or if you're taking any medication that could explain your hypersomnia. Your GP may also suggest keeping a diary of your sleeping patterns and sleepiness levels for a few weeks, or filling in a questionnaire called the Epworth sleepiness scale to assess whether you're excessively sleepy during the day. If necessary, your GP can refer you to a doctor specialising in sleep disorders for tests to help diagnose the cause of your symptoms. Seeing a sleep specialist A number of tests can be carried out to assess your sleep and help identify any underlying cause. These are usually carried out at a specialist sleep centre. Two of the main tests used are: Polysomnography (a night time sleep test), which will help rule out sleep disorders such as narcolepsy or sleep apnoea. You stay in a special bedroom and are observed from another room through the night. Electrodes are attached to your face, head and body to record brainwaves, muscle activity, eye movement, breathing and snoring.  Multiple sleep latency test \u2013 this test usually follows the next day. You'll be asked to take several naps throughout the day, so doctors can see how long it takes you to fall asleep when instructed (this shouldn't take longer than eight minutes for someone with hypersomnia). Doctors may diagnose idiopathic hypersomnia if you have excessive daytime sleepiness and need regular daytime naps, but no other cause is found. Managing idiopathic hypersomnia Idiopathic hypersomnia doesn't usually get better by itself. Many people find that the symptoms improve with treatment. Medication There are no medicines specifically designed to treat idiopathic hypersomnia, but medications used for narcolepsy can often help. The main medications used are stimulants, such as modafinil, dexamphetamine and methylphenidate, which help to keep you awake during the day. See treating narcolepsy for more information on these medicines. Antidepressants may be prescribed if emotional problems are interfering with your sleep. A medicine called flumazenil has been shown to help some patients with idiopathic hypersomnia, although more research is needed to be sure of its effectiveness. Lifestyle changes It may also help to adopt good sleeping habits, such as avoiding alcohol, caffeine and medications that make the condition worse, sticking to a bedtime routine, and avoiding working at night or engaging in social activities that delay bedtime. Idiopathic hypersomnia or narcolepsy? Idiopathic hypersomnia is similar to narcolepsy, in that both cause excessive daytime sleepiness and can mean you fall asleep at virtually any time, but there are some key differences:  In narcolepsy, you may lose muscle control when experiencing strong emotions (cataplexy) \u2013 this does not happen in idiopathic hypersomnia. People with narcolepsy often have very vivid dreams and even hallucinations when they are drowsy, which are generally not seen in idiopathic hypersomnia. The overnight sleep in narcolepsy is usually very fragmented and of poor quality, but people with idiopathic hypersomnia tend to sleep continuously through the night. Short daytime naps in narcolepsy tend to be refreshing, but naps in idiopathic hypersomnia are more like long sleeps and are not refreshing. In idiopathic hypersomnia, you don't tend to fall quickly into rapid eye movement (REM) or dream sleep, which is often a key feature in narcolepsy.

It usually occurs during a period of deep sleep. This is at its height during the early part of the night, so it tends to occur in the first few hours after falling asleep. Sleepwalking can start at any age, but is more common in children. It\u2019s thought that at least 20% of children will sleepwalk at least once. Most will grow out of it by the time they reach puberty, but it can sometimes persist into adult life. This page explains: Why some people sleepwalk What happens when a person sleepwalks What to do if you find someone sleepwalking When to seek medical advice Treatments for sleepwalking Preventing accidents Why some people sleepwalk The exact cause of sleepwalking is unknown, but it seems to run in families. You\u2019re more likely to sleepwalk if other members of your close family have or had sleepwalking behaviours or night terrors. The following things can trigger sleepwalking or make it worse: not getting enough sleep stress and anxiety infection with a fever (especially in children) drinking too much alcohol taking recreational drugs  certain types of medication, such as some sedatives being startled by a sudden noise or touch, causing abrupt waking from deep sleep waking up suddenly from deep sleep because you need to go to the toilet Other sleep disorders that can cause you to frequently wake up suddenly during the night, such as obstructive sleep apnoea and restless legs syndrome, can also trigger a sleepwalking episode. Taking steps to prevent some of these triggers, such as making sure you get enough sleep and working on strategies to deal with and reduce stress, will often help (see treatments for sleepwalking below). What happens when a person sleepwalks Some episodes of sleepwalking may involve the person just sitting up in bed and looking around, briefly appearing confused, while in others the person may get out of bed and walk about, open cupboards, get dressed or eat, and may appear agitated. In extreme cases, the person may walk out of the house and carry out complex activities, such as driving a car. While sleepwalking, the eyes are usually open, though the person will look straight through people and not recognise them. They can often manoeuvre well around familiar objects. If you talk to a person who is sleepwalking, they may partially respond or say things that don't make sense. Most sleepwalking episodes last less than 10 minutes, but can be longer. At the end of each episode, the person may wake up or they may return to bed and go to sleep. They won't normally have any memory of it in the morning or have patchy memory. If woken while sleepwalking, the person may feel confused and not remember what happened. What to do if you find someone sleepwalking The best thing to do if you see someone sleepwalking is to make sure they are safe. Gently guide them back to bed by reassuring them. If undisturbed, they will often go back to sleep again. Sometimes, gently waking the person after they have fully come out of the episode, before settling them back to sleep, will prevent another episode occurring from the same deep sleep cycle. Don't shout or startle the person and don't try to physically restrain them unless they're in danger, as they may lash out. When to seek medical advice Occasional sleepwalking episodes don't usually need medical attention. Sleepwalking is rarely a sign of anything serious and may get better with time, particularly in children. However, you should consider seeing your GP if the sleepwalking episodes occur frequently, you\u2019re concerned the person may be at risk of injuring themselves or others, or the episodes continue or start in adult life. Your GP may refer you to a specialist sleep centre, where your or your child's sleep history can be discussed  in more detail, and, if appropriate, sleep studies arranged to exclude other conditions that could be triggering the sleepwalking, such as obstructive sleep apnoea or restless legs syndrome. Treatments for sleepwalking There's no specific treatment for sleepwalking, but it generally helps to try to get enough sleep and have a regular and relaxing routine before bedtime.  You may find the following advice helpful: try to go to bed at a similar time each night make sure your bedroom is dark and quiet when you go to sleep limit drinks before bedtime, particularly those containing caffeine, and go to the toilet before going to sleep find ways to relax before going to bed, such as having a warm bath, reading or deep breathing if your child sleepwalks at the same time most nights, try gently waking them for a short time 15-30 minutes before they would normally sleepwalk \u2013 this may stop them sleepwalking by altering their normal sleep cycle Read about how to establish a regular bedtime routine and healthy sleep tips for children. Medication isn't usually used to treat sleepwalking. However, medicines such as benzodiazepines or antidepressants are sometimes used if you sleepwalk often or there's a risk you could seriously injure yourself or others. These medications can help you sleep and may reduce the frequency of sleepwalking episodes. Therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or hypnotherapy may sometimes be helpful. Preventing accidents It's important to keep the areas of your home where a person may sleepwalk free of breakable or potentially harmful objects, and to remove any items they could trip over. It's also a good idea to keep windows and doors locked. If your child sleepwalks, don't let them sleep on the top bed of a bunk bed. You may want to fit safety gates at the top of the stairs. It's also important to let babysitters, relatives or friends who look after your child at night know that your child may sleepwalk, and what they should do if it happens.

This can cause back pain and neck pain, as well as symptoms such as numbness, a tingling sensation, or weakness in other areas of the body. The sciatic nerve is often affected in cases of slipped disc. It is the longest nerve in the body and runs from the back of the pelvis, through the buttocks and down both legs to the feet. If pressure is placed on the sciatic nerve (sciatica), it can cause mild to severe pain in the leg, hip or buttocks. Read more about the symptoms of a slipped disc. The spine The spine consists of 24 individual bones called vertebrae that are stacked on top of each other. In between each vertebra there are protective circular pads of cartilage (connective tissue) called discs, which have a tough, fibrous case that contains a softer gel-like substance. The discs help maintain your back's flexibility and wide range of movement. The spinal cord is highly sensitive and passes through the middle of the vertebral column. It contains nerve cells and bundles of nerve fibres that connect all parts of the body to the brain. What causes a slipped disc? A slipped disc occurs when the outer case of the disc splits, resulting in the gel inside bulging out of the disc. The damaged disc can put pressure on the whole spinal cord or on a single nerve root (where a nerve leaves the spinal cord). This means a slipped disc can cause pain both in the area of the protruding disc and in the area of the body controlled by the nerve that the disc is pressing on. It is not always clear what causes a disc to break down, although age is a common factor in many cases. As you get older, your spinal discs start to lose their water content, making them less flexible and more likely to rupture. Smoking also plays a role as it causes the discs to lose their natural flexibility. It's important to note not all slipped discs cause symptoms such as pain, weakness or tingling. Many people will go their whole life and not know they have a slipped disc, even though they have one. Read more about what causes a slipped disc. Diagnosing a slipped disc Your GP will usually be able to diagnose a slipped disc from your symptoms and medical history. They may also carry out a physical examination to test your: posture reflexes muscle strength walking ability sensation in your limbs Read more about how a slipped disc is diagnosed. Treating a slipped disc It can take about four to six weeks to recover from a slipped disc. Treatment usually involves a combination of physical therapy, such as massage and exercise, and medication to relieve the pain. Surgery to release the compressed nerve and remove part of the disc may be considered in severe cases, or if the pain continues for longer than six weeks. In many cases, a slipped disc will eventually shrink back away from the nerve and the pain will ease as the disc stops pressing on the affected nerve. Often the slipped disc will stay pressing on the nerve, but the pain goes away because the brain learns to \"turn down the volume\" on the pain messages coming from the nerve. If you have a slipped disc, it is very important to keep active. Initially moving may be difficult, but after resting for a couple of days you should start to move around.  This will help keep your back mobile and stop the joints becoming stiff and the muscles that support the spine becoming weak. Keeping moving will speed up your recovery. Any exercise you do should be gentle and not put too much strain on your back. Exercises that involve high impact, such as running, jumping or twisting, should be avoided at first as they may cause a flare-up of the pain. Read more about treating a slipped disc. Preventing a slipped disc Taking a few sensible precautions, such as leading a healthy lifestyle, can help prevent back pain and lower your risk of getting a slipped disc. For example, you should: take regular exercise use a safe technique when lifting heavy objects always maintain a good posture when sitting and standing quit smoking if you smoke Read more about preventing a slipped disc.

Slipped discs are most common in people aged between 30 and 50 years old. The condition affects twice as many men as women. Slipped discs often occur in the lower back. While around a third of adults in the UK have lower back pain, fewer than 1 in 20 people have a slipped disc.

It is a complicated and highly specialised operation that is not commonly performed, although the number of procedures carried out has increased in recent years. Currently, around 15-20 small bowel transplants are performed each year in the UK. These procedures are carried out at four specialist centres \u2013 Birmingham Children\u2019s Hospital, Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital in Cambridge, John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford and King's College Hospital in London. Why small bowel transplants are carried out A small bowel transplant is an option for children and adults whose bowel has stopped working properly and who are being fed by total parenteral nutrition (TPN). This is where a person requires all their nutrition to be given through a drip into a vein because their bowel is unable to absorb nutrients from any food they eat. While many people needing TPN can have this treatment at home without experiencing any significant problems, the long-term use of TPN can lead to serious complications such as liver disease and repeated infections. A small bowel transplant may be considered when the person has a serious problem with their bowel, but has developed complications from TPN or is unable to tolerate this form of feeding. Read more about when a small bowel transplant is needed. Getting ready Before having a small bowel transplant, you will need a transplant assessment. This involves tests and conversations with a transplant team to check if you are suitable for the procedure. If you are suitable, you will be placed on a national waiting list until suitable organs from a recently deceased donor become available. You may be contacted at any time by the transplant team, day or night. How long you have to wait will depend on your blood group, the availability of donors and how many urgent cases are on the list. On average, people wait just under six months for a small bowel transplant. In some cases, it may be possible for a family member to donate a section of their bowel for transplantation, without you needing to be placed on the waiting list. Read more about preparing for a small bowel transplant. The operation A small bowel transplant is a complicated and difficult operation that takes, on average, around 8-10 hours and is carried out under general anaesthetic. During the procedure, the surgeon will remove the bowel and connect the transplanted bowel to your blood vessels and digestive tract. They will also form an ileostomy, where part of the small bowel is diverted through an opening in the tummy, called a stoma. The stoma will allow digestive waste to pass out of your body into an external pouch, and lets the transplant team easily assess the health of your transplanted bowel. Although it is not always possible, the ileostomy may be reversed a few months later. Read more about how a small bowel transplant is performed. After the operation Recovering from a small bowel transplant can take a long time, and you'll probably need to stay in hospital for at least four to six weeks. While in hospital, you will receive medication to reduce the risk of your body rejecting the new organ; these are known as immunosuppressants. You will be slowly weaned from TPN to eating a normal diet. After leaving hospital, you'll need to continue taking immunosuppressant medication and have regular check-ups for the rest of your life. Read more about recovering from a small bowel transplant. Outlook Although medication and regular check-ups will be needed indefinitely, a small bowel transplant can allow you to live as normal a life as possible \u2013 including working, enjoying hobbies and living independently. However, due to the risks of surgery and the general poor health of people who are considered for a small bowel transplant, some people will die within a few years of their operation. Current figures for transplants carried out in the UK between January 1998 and December 2013 show that: after 90 days \u2013 84% of adults and 88% of children are still alive after one year \u2013 76% of adults and 72% of children are still alive after five years \u2013 62% of adults and 51% of children are still alive However, the outlook for small bowel transplants carried out now is likely to be better than these figures suggest, as medical knowledge and techniques are constantly improving.

The cervix is the entrance to the womb from the vagina. Detecting and removing abnormal cervical cells can prevent cervical cancer. Cervical screening isn't a test for cancer; it's a test to check the health of the cells of the cervix. Most women's test results show that everything is normal, but for around 1 in 20 women the test shows some abnormal changes in the cells of the cervix. Most of these changes won't lead to cervical cancer and the cells may go back to normal on their own. However, in some cases, the abnormal cells need to be removed so they can't become cancerous. About 3,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK. It's possible for women of all ages to develop cervical cancer, although the condition mainly affects sexually active women aged 30 to 45. The condition is very rare in women under 25. The cervical screening programme The aim of the NHS Cervical Screening Programme is to reduce the number of women who develop cervical cancer and the number of women who die from the condition. Since the screening programme was introduced in the 1980s, the number of cervical cancer cases has decreased by about 7% each year. All women who are registered with a GP are invited for cervical screening: aged 25 to 49 \u2013 every three years aged 50 to 64 \u2013 every five years over 65 \u2013 only women who haven't been screened since age 50 or those who have recently had abnormal tests Being screened regularly means any abnormal changes in the cells of the cervix can be identified at an early stage and, if necessary, treated to stop cancer developing. However, cervical screening isn't 100% accurate and doesn't prevent all cases of cervical cancer. Screening is a personal choice and you have the right to choose not to attend. Read about: why cervical screening is offered when cervical screening is offered What happens when you go for cervical screening? Booking your test You'll receive a letter through the post asking you to make an appointment for a cervical screening test. The letter should contain the details of the place you need to contact for the appointment. Most women choose to go to their GP practice, although it may also be available at a well woman clinic or sexual health clinic. Screening is usually carried out by the practice nurse. You can ask to have a female doctor or nurse. If possible, try to book an appointment during the middle of your menstrual cycle (usually 14 days from the start of your last period), as this can ensure a better sample of cells is taken. If you use a spermicide, a barrier method of contraception or a lubricant jelly, you shouldn't use these for 24 hours before the test, as the chemicals they contain may affect the test. Your screening appointment The cervical screening test usually takes around five minutes to carry out. You'll be asked to undress from the waist down and lie on a couch, although you can usually remain fully dressed if you're wearing a loose skirt. The doctor or nurse will gently put an instrument, called a speculum, into your vagina. This holds the walls of the vagina open so the cervix can be seen. A small soft brush will be used to gently collect some cells from the surface of your cervix. Some women find the procedure a bit uncomfortable or embarrassing, but for most women it's not painful. If you find the test painful, tell the doctor or nurse, because they may be able to reduce your discomfort. Try to relax as much as possible, because being tense makes the test more difficult to carry out. Taking slow, deep breaths will help. The cell sample is then sent off to a laboratory for analysis and you should receive the result within two weeks. HPV testing Changes in the cells of the cervix are often caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). There are more than 100 different types of HPV. Some types are high risk and some types are low risk. HPV-16 and HPV-18 are considered to be highest risk for cervical cancer. After successful trials, HPV testing has been incorporated into the NHS Cervical Screening Programme. If a sample taken during the cervical screening test shows low-grade or borderline cell abnormalities, the sample should automatically be tested for HPV. If HPV is found in your sample, you should be referred for a colposcopy for further investigation and, if necessary, treatment. If no HPV is found, you'll carry on being routinely screened as normal. If your sample shows more significant cell changes, you'll be referred for colposcopy without HPV testing. In some areas, a test for HPV is the first test on the screening sample. In these cases, the sample is only checked for abnormal cells if HPV is found. If HPV isn\u2019t found, you'll be offered a screening test again in three to five years (depending on your age).

It's usually caused by a nasal condition or brain injury, but some people are born without a sense of smell (congenital anosmia). Losing your sense of smell can be very depressing and isolating. It means missing out on many experiences most of us take for granted, such as smelling fresh flowers, perfume or the scent of a loved one. Smell also plays an important role in how you taste things. Many people with anosmia lose interest in food, because 80% of the flavour of food comes from its smell. If you've suddenly lost your sense of smell and don't know why, see your GP. They may be able to diagnose an underlying cause (see below) and offer treatment to restore your sense of smell. Seeing your GP Your GP will want to take your full medical history, examine the inside of your nose and take a blood sample for testing in a laboratory. Your doctor may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist in hospital. Further tests, such as a CT scan, MRI scan or nasal endoscopy (where a thin tube with a camera is inserted up your nose), can be used to investigate the cause. What are the causes? There are several medical conditions and medications associated with a loss of smell. The possible causes include: a viral infection affecting the upper respiratory tract, such as a cold persistent (chronic) sinusitis, with or without nasal polyps a nose abnormality, such as a crooked nose or a nasal septum (wall dividing the nostrils) that isn't straight hay fever (rhinitis) that causes severe inflammation of the nasal passages certain medication, including antibiotics such as metronidazole recreational drug use such as cocaine or amphetamines diabetes long-term alcohol misuse an underactive thyroid Cushing's syndrome (high levels of the hormone cortisol in the blood) exposure to a chemical that burns the inside of the nose a head injury a brain tumour radiotherapy to the head and neck epilepsy Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease stroke liver or kidney disease vitamin B12 deficiency schizophrenia granulomatosis with polyangiitis \u2013 an uncommon disorder of the blood vessels sarcoidosis \u2013 a rare disease that causes body cells to form into clumps In general, anosmia is usually caused by either a problem with odours getting to the top of the nose (because of swelling or a blockage in the nose) or a problem with nerve signals from the nose to the brain. However, in around 20% of cases, the cause can't be found. This is known as idiopathic anosmia. Congenital anosmia An estimated 6,000 people in the UK are born without a sense of smell because of a genetic condition or faulty gene. This is known as congenital anosmia. It can occur alone (isolated congenital anosmia) or it can be a symptom of another genetic condition, such as Kallmann syndrome or Klinefelter syndrome. Can anosmia be cured? Whether or not anosmia can be cured depends on the underlying cause. People with congenital anosmia have a lifelong inability to smell and have no concept of what a smell even is. Currently, there's no known cure or treatment for congenital anosmia. However, other types of anosmia may be improved or cured when the underlying condition is treated. For example, if the cause is swelling in the nose or sinuses, steroids can usually clear this up and restore your sense of smell. Treatments that may help, depending on your condition, are: nasal washing (douching) a steroid nasal spray an antihistamine steroid tablets an operation to have nasal polyps removed an operation to straighten the nasal septum an operation to clear out the sinuses, called endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) (see below) These treatments may come with unpleasant side effects. Speak to your doctor about whether any of these treatments may be suitable for you and, if so, what side effects you may experience. ESS In bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), the surgeon opens all your sinuses and clears them out to reduce inflammation and allow nasal rinses and sprays to reach them. In some centres, this may involve the use of an image guidance system (IGS) to map out your sinuses. ESS also involves removing any polyps present at the same time. This treatment can bring back some sense of smell for many people with anosmia when medication alone has failed. However, if you don't keep taking your nasal medications afterwards, the anosmia is likely to return. If you've had surgery to remove nasal polyps, it's quite common for these to grow back, and many people find they need another operation. However, ESS may reduce the need for further surgery. A recent journal publication looked at how successful ESS with IGS was in treating patients with chronic frontal sinusitis, some of whom also had nasal polyps. Data from a five-year period showed that only four patients out of 141 (3%) needed to have further surgery after having ESS with IGS as their first operation. IGS is not available in all hospitals, but may be performed by specialist centres where possible. Safety If you have anosmia, you'll need to take special precautions because you won't be able to smell fires, poisonous fumes, leaking gas or food that has gone off. It's recommended that you: install smoke alarms in all areas of the home, especially in the kitchen and near the fireplace change from natural gas appliances to electric or consider installing a natural gas detector clearly mark expiry dates on food and mark leftovers with dates, so you know when to throw them away carefully read warning labels on products such as bathroom and kitchen cleaners, and insecticides, to be aware of potent chemicals Some people with anosmia also experience a loss of appetite, but it's important to maintain your nutrition levels. It may help to set reminders for mealtimes and weigh yourself regularly to ensure you stay healthy.

It is also known as an \"olfactory hallucination\". The smell is unique to the person and is usually unpleasant, spoiling the taste of any food or drink consumed.It can be in one or both nostrils. Most phantom smells go away in time and are not caused by anything serious. But if the problem persists and you're worried, see your GP. How does your sense of smell work? When something gives off a smell, it means tiny molecules have evaporated from its surface and reached your nose. High up inside your nose is tissue containing specialised nerve cells, called olfactory sensory neurons, which connect directly to your brain. These nerve cells have receptors that detect the microscopic odour molecules and send electrical signals to the brain. The brain receives these signals and identifies the smell. There are two ways smells can reach the olfactory sensory neurons: By the 'front door' through the nostrils. By the 'back door' through the throat to the back of the nasal cavity. Chewing food releases odour molecules and when you swallow, the tongue pushes this air into the back of the nasal cavity (this is known as \"retro-nasal olfaction\"). What could cause phantom smells? There are a wide range of possible causes of phantosmia, which include: nasal infection \u2013 some people start to perceive a smell after they develop an infection that affects their nose or sinuses (read about sinusitis). The smell may become noticeable after a sudden change in airflow through their nose \u2013 for example, just after they've sneezed. It usually goes away when the infection clears nasal polyps, which are abnormal tissue growths that form inside the nasal passages and sinuses (read more about nasal polyps) migraine with aura \u2013 some people smell phantom odours just before or during a migraine (read more about migraines) dental problems smoking exposure to certain chemicals such as insecticides or solvents radiation for treatment of head and neck cancer Neurological (nervous system) conditions Less commonly, the cause of phantosmia is either nerve cells sending abnormal smell signals to the brain, or a problem with the brain itself. This may be the result of: a disease affecting the nervous system, such as epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease or Alzheimer\u2019s disease a stroke a head injury cancer \u2013 usually a brain tumour or neuroblastoma (a rare cancer that may start in the olfactory nerve) The above links will take you to more information on these conditions.  How is it diagnosed? Your GP will want to know if the problem is definitely with your sense of smell, and not with your sense of taste (it's easy to confuse these). They will also want to determine whether the smell is perceived, as in phantosmia, or actually real \u2013 you might be giving off and detecting a body odour, for example. You'll have a head and neck examination, to see if there is any obvious problem such as something in your nasal passages. The GP will want to know if the smell transmits through one nostril or both. You may be referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist for further tests, which may include: a nasal endoscopy, where a fine, flexible tube with a tiny camera at the end is inserted up through your nose and images are viewed on a television screen (read more about an endoscopy) an MRI scan or CT scan of your brain and nasal cavities, to rule out tumours, infections or obstructions How is phantosmia treated? Some people with phantosmia will find that the smell gradually fades over a few months, and no treatment is needed. If it is caused by an illness such as sinusitis, it should go when you recover from the illness. Otherwise, if it persists, the following treatments may be tried: Rinsing out the nasal passages with saline solution, which may provide temporary relief for short periods of time. This may temporarily block the smell signals going to your brain, but you'll need to keep doing it.

Who gets smelly feet? Anyone can get smelly feet but they're more likely if you: are a teenager are pregnant are under mental or emotional stress stand up all day at work have a medical condition called hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)  are taking certain prescribed medications Medically known as bromodosis, stinky feet are a common year-round problem. The main cause is sweaty feet combined with wearing the same shoes every day. Why feet sweat Anyone can get sweaty feet, regardless of the temperature or time of year. But teenagers and pregnant women are especially prone because hormonal changes make them sweat more. You're also more likely to have foot perspiration if you're on your feet all day, if you're under a lot of stress or if you have a medical condition called hyperhidrosis, which makes you sweat more than usual. Fungal infections, such as athlete's foot, can also lead to bad foot odour. According to podiatrist, Lorraine Jones, feet become smelly if sweat soaks into shoes and they don't dry before you wear them again. Bacteria on the skin break down sweat as it comes from the pores. A cheesy odour is released as the sweat decomposes. \"Your feet sweat into your shoes all day so they get damp and bacteria start to grow. The bacteria continue to breed once you've taken your shoes off, especially if you put them in a dark cupboard. Then, when you put your shoes back on the next day, even if you've just had a shower, putting your feet into still damp shoes creates the perfect conditions for the bacteria to thrive \u2013 warm, dark and moist.\" How to treat smelly feet The good news is that there's a simple, quick, sure-fire solution to smelly feet. Wash your feet with an anti-bacterial soap called Hibiscrub. There are lots of over-the-counter foot hygiene products at your local chemist, but Hibiscrub is the best one. Leave on the Hibiscrub for a couple of minutes, then wash it off. According to Lorraine, \"if you do this twice a day, you'll definitely banish smelly feet within a week.\" She adds that you shouldn't use Hibiscrub on your feet if you have broken skin, such as eczema. Preventing smelly feet Keeping feet fresh and sweet smelling is all down to good personal hygiene and changing your shoes regularly. To keep feet fresh: Never wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row. Instead, wear different shoes on successive days so they have at least 24 hours to dry out. Make sure teenage boys have two pairs of trainers so that they don't have to wear the same pair for two or more consecutive days. Wash and dry your feet every day and change your socks (ideally wool or cotton, not nylon) at least once a day. Keep your toenails short and clean and remove any hard skin with a foot file. Hard skin can become soggy when damp, which provides an ideal home for bacteria If you're particularly susceptible to sweaty feet, it's a good idea to: dab between your toes with cotton wool dipped in surgical spirit after a shower or bath \u2013 surgical spirit helps dry out the skin between the toes really well \u2013 in addition to drying them with a towel use a spray deodorant or antiperspirant on your feet \u2013 a normal underarm deodorant or antiperspirant works just as well as a specialist foot product and will cost you less put medicated insoles, which have a deodorising effect, in your shoes try feet-fresh socks \u2013 some sports socks have ventilation panels to keep feet dry, and antibacterial socks are impregnated with chemicals to discourage the odour-producing bacteria that feed on sweat wear leather or canvas shoes, as they let your feet breathe, unlike plastic ones wear open-toed sandals in summer and go barefoot at home in the evenings When to see a doctor Smelly feet are a harmless problem that generally clears up. Sometimes, however, it can be a sign of a medical condition. See your GP if simple measures to reduce your foot odour don't help, or if you're worried that your level of sweating is abnormally high. Your doctor can offer you a strong prescription antiperspirant or refer you for a treatment called iontophoresis, which delivers a mild electric current through water to your feet to combat excessive sweating. Here are more tips on how to look after your feet. Top tip for prevention 'Never wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row. Instead, wear different shoes on successive days so they have a minimum of 24 hours to dry out'  Lorraine Jones, chiropodist     Page last reviewed: 11\/12\/2015 Next review due: 11\/12\/2017 More articles on: Foot health Share: Save: Subscribe:  Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Some people find that their urine smells stronger and is darker first thing in the morning when it's more concentrated, or generally when they're dehydrated. Also, certain food and drinks, including asparagus, beer, garlic and coffee, may temporarily give urine a stronger smell. Certain medicines and vitamin and mineral supplements can also alter the odour of urine \u2013 but never stop taking any medication without speaking to your GP first. You may find the smell of your urine improves by drinking more fluids. Generally, make sure you drink enough fluid so you're not thirsty for long periods, and steadily increase your fluid intake when exercising and during hot weather. Do I ever need to see my GP? It's not necessary to see your GP about smelly urine unless you're concerned \u2013 for example, if you have other symptoms too. See your GP if: You have symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), such as pain or a burning sensation when urinating and a need to urinate often. This is the most likely cause of unexplained foul-smelling urine. A UTI will often get better on its own, especially if you increase your fluid intake. It is less likely to get better without treatment in men than in women. You have diabetes and feel you're not managing it properly \u2013 urine can smell abnormally sweet in uncontrolled diabetes. Could it indicate any other medical condition? The following conditions can sometimes cause smelly urine, but they are uncommon:  urinary stones \u2013 these may cause an ammonia-like odour (read about bladder stones and kidney stones) a bladder fistula \u2013 this is an abnormal connection between your intestines and bladder maple syrup urine disease \u2013 this rare genetic disease means you have difficulty breaking down certain amino acids liver failure (read about the different types of liver disease that can lead to liver failure) diabetic ketoacidosis \u2013 this dangerous complication of diabetes happens when the body is unable to use blood glucose because there isn't enough insulin, so it breaks down fat as an alternative source of fuel, causing a build-up of a by-product called ketones  Page last reviewed: 16\/10\/2014 Next review due: 16\/10\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The best way to protect loved ones is to quit smoking. At the very least, make sure you have a smokefree home and car. When you smoke a cigarette (or roll-up, pipe or cigar), most of the smoke doesn't go into your lungs, it goes into the air around you where anyone nearby can breathe it in. Secondhand smoke is the smoke that you exhale plus the 'sidestream' smoke created by the lit end of your cigarette. When friends and family breathe in your secondhand smoke \u2013 what we call passive smoking \u2013 it isn't just unpleasant for them, it can damage their health too. People who breathe in secondhand smoke regularly are more likely to get the same diseases as smokers, including lung cancer and heart disease. Pregnant women exposed to passive smoke are more prone to premature birth and their baby is more at risk of low birthweight and cot death. And children who live in a smoky house are at higher risk of breathing problems, asthma, and allergies. How to protect against secondhand smoke The only surefire way to protect your friends and family from secondhand smoke is to keep the environment around them smoke free. The best way to do that is to quit smoking completely. If you're not ready to quit, make every effort to keep your cigarette smoke away from other people and never smoke indoors or in the car. Always smoke outside Ask your visitors to smoke outside Don't smoke in the car or allow anyone else to Take steps NOW to stop smoking. The risks of passive smoking Secondhand smoke is a lethal cocktail of more than 4,000 irritants, toxins and cancer-causing substances. Most secondhand smoke is invisible and odourless, so no matter how careful you think you're being, people around you still breathe in the harmful poisons. Opening windows and doors or smoking in another room in the house doesn't protect people. Smoke can linger in the air for two to three hours after you've finished a cigarette, even with a window open. And even if you limit smoking to one room, the smoke will spread to the rest of the house where people can inhale it. Is passive smoking harmful? Read about stop smoking treatments. Children and passive smoking Passive smoking is especially harmful for children as they have less well-developed airways, lungs and immune systems. It's estimated that more than one in five children in the UK live in a household where at least one person smokes and, as a result, they're more likely to develop: asthma chest infections \u2013 like pneumonia and bronchitis meningitis ear infections coughs and colds Children are particularly vulnerable in the family car where secondhand smoke can reach hazardous levels even with the windows open. It's estimated that smoking in cars produces concentrations of toxins up to 11 times higher than you used to find in the average smoky pub. To protect children, there is a new ban on smoking in cars and other vehicles carrying children. From October 1 2015 it is against the law to smoke in a private vehicle if there\u2019s a young person under-18 present. Read about the new law on smoking in private vehicles. How safe is e-cig vapour? E-cigarettes don't produce tobacco smoke so the risks of passive smoking with conventional cigarettes don't apply to e-cigs. Research into this area is ongoing, but it seems that e-cigs release negligible amounts of nicotine into the atmosphere and the limited evidence available suggests that any risk from passive vaping to bystanders is small relative to tobacco cigarettes. In England, the Government has no plans to ban vaping indoors (although some employers have banned them in the workplace) but some health professionals recommend avoiding using them around pregnant women, babies and children. Read about the safety of e-cigarettes. Your GP can give you advice about quitting smoking.

The main options are: Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) Varenicline (Champix) Bupropion (Zyban) E-cigarettes The best treatment for you will depend on your personal preference, your age, whether you're pregnant or breastfeeding and any medical conditions you have. Speak to your GP or an NHS stop smoking adviser for advice. Research has shown that all these methods can be effective. Importantly, evidence shows that they are most effective if used alongside support from an NHS stop smoking service. The treatments available are outlined below. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons of stop smoking treatments, allowing you to compare your options. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) The main reason that people smoke is because they are addicted to nicotine. NRT is a medication that provides you with a low level of nicotine, without the tar, carbon monoxide and other poisonous chemicals present in tobacco smoke. It can help reduce unpleasant withdrawal effects, such as bad moods and cravings, which may occur when you stop smoking. Where to get it and how to use it NRT can be bought from pharmacies and some shops. It's also available on prescription from a doctor or NHS stop smoking service. It's available as: skin patches chewing gum inhalators (which look like plastic cigarettes) tablets, oral strips and lozenges nasal and mouth spray Patches release nicotine slowly. Some are worn all the time and some should be taken off at night. Inhalators, gum and sprays act more quickly and may be better for alleviating cravings. There's no evidence that any single type of NRT is more effective than another. But there is good evidence to show that using a combination of NRT is more effective than using a single product. Often the best way to use NRT is to combine a patch with a faster acting form such as gum, inhalator or nasal spray. Treatment with NRT usually lasts 8-12 weeks, before you gradually reduce the dose and eventually stop. Who can use it Most people are able to use NRT, including: adults and children over 12 years of age \u2013 although children under 18 shouldn't use the lozenges without getting medical advice first pregnant women \u2013 your doctor may suggest NRT if they think it would help you quit; read more about stopping smoking in pregnancy breastfeeding women \u2013 your doctor can advise you how to do this safely Always read the packet or leaflet before using NRT to check whether it's suitable for you. Sometimes it may be advisable to get medical advice first, for example if you have kidney or liver problems, or you've recently had a heart attack or stroke. Possible side effects Side effects of NRT can include: skin irritation when using patches irritation of nose, throat or eyes when using a nasal spray difficulty sleeping (insomnia), sometimes with vivid dreams an upset stomach dizziness headaches Any side effects are usually mild. But if they're particularly troublesome, contact your GP as the dose or type of NRT may need to be changed. Varenicline (Champix) Varenicline (brand name Champix) is a medication that works in two ways. It reduces cravings for nicotine like NRT, but it also blocks the rewarding and reinforcing effects of smoking. Evidence suggests it's the most effective medication for helping people stop smoking. Where to get it and how to use it Varenicline is only available on prescription, so you'll usually need to see your GP or contact an NHS stop smoking service to get it. It's taken as one to two tablets a day. You should start taking it a week or two before you try to quit. A course of treatment usually lasts around 12 weeks, but it can be continued for longer if necessary. Who can use it Varenicline is safe for most people to take, although there are some situations when it's not recommended. For example, it's not suitable for: children under 18 years of age women who are pregnant or breastfeeding people with severe kidney problems Possible side effects Side effects of varenicline can include: feeling and being sick difficulty sleeping (insomnia), sometimes with vivid dreams dry mouth constipation or diarrhoea headaches drowsiness dizziness Speak to your GP if you experience any troublesome side effects. Bupropion (Zyban) Bupropion (brand name Zyban) is a medication originally used to treat depression, but it has since been found to help people quit smoking. It's not clear exactly how it works, but it's thought to have an effect on the parts of the brain involved in addictive behaviour. Where to get it and how to use it Bupropion is only available on prescription, so you'll usually need to see your GP or contact an NHS stop smoking service to get it. It's taken as one to two tablets a day. You should start taking it a week or two before you try to quit. A course of treatment usually lasts around seven to nine weeks. Who can use it Bupropion is safe for most people to take, although there are some situations when it's not recommended. For example, it's not suitable for: children under 18 years of age women who are pregnant or breastfeeding people with epilepsy, bipolar disorder or eating disorders Possible side effects  Side effects of bupropion can include: dry mouth  difficulty sleeping (insomnia) headaches feeling and being sick constipation difficulty concentrating dizziness Speak to your GP if you experience any troublesome side effects. E-cigarettes An e-cigarette is an electronic device that delivers nicotine in a vapour. This allows you to inhale nicotine without most of the harmful effects of smoking, as the vapour contains no tar or carbon monoxide. Research has found that e-cigarettes can help you give up smoking, so you may want to try them rather than the medications listed above. As with other approaches, they're most effective if used with support from an NHS stop smoking service. There are no e-cigarettes currently available on prescription. But once medicinally licensed e-cigarette products become available, GPs and stop smoking services will be able to prescribe them. For now, if you want to use an e-cigarette to help you quit, you'll have to buy one. Costs of e-cigarettes can vary, but generally they're much cheaper than cigarettes. Read more about e-cigarettes.

Some snakes are venomous and can inject venom (toxin) as they bite. A bite from a venomous snake is a medical emergency as they can be deadly if not treated quickly. In the UK, adders are the only venomous snakes found in the wild. People also keep foreign (exotic) venomous snakes, sometimes illegally. Exotic snakes have been known to bite while being handled carelessly, or when they escape from their cages. There's also a risk of being bitten while travelling abroad to tropical countries. Symptoms of snake bites If an adder injects venom when it bites, it can cause serious symptoms including: pain, redness and swelling in the area of the bite nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting dizziness and fainting A foreign snake that injects venom when it bites can also cause: extensive swelling, blistering and, eventually, gangrene in the area of the bite shock muscle paralysis (an inability to move one or more muscles of the body) leading to difficulties swallowing and breathing bleeding Sometimes, venomous snakes can bite without injecting venom. This is called a \u2018dry bite' causing only: mild pain (from the snake's teeth puncturing the skin) anxiety Read more about the symptoms of snake bites. What to do after a snake bite Immediately after being bitten by a snake you should: remain calm and don't panic; snake bites, particularly those that occur in the UK, are not often serious and rarely deadly try to remember the shape, size and colour of the snake keep the part of your body that has been bitten as still as possible to prevent the venom spreading around your body remove jewellery and watches from the bitten limb because they could cut into your skin if the limb swells do not attempt to remove any clothing, such as trousers, but loosen clothing if possible Seek immediate medical assistance by dialling 999 to request an ambulance or visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. You should give healthcare professionals a description of the snake to help identify it. You may be admitted to hospital so the bite can be assessed and your condition closely monitored. Read more about what to do if bitten by a snake and how snake bites are assessed. Treating snake bites In most cases of adder bites, the only treatment required is observation in hospital. As a precaution, you may be asked to stay in hospital for 24 hours to be monitored. Antivenom medication is an effective antidote to snake venom and can be used to treat more severe snake bites. In most cases, children bitten by an adder will make a full recovery in about one to two weeks. Adults usually require more than two weeks to recover fully, and a quarter of adults will take between one and nine months. Read more about how snake bites are treated. Why do snakes bite? When a snake bites, it injects venom to immobilise its natural (food) prey. As humans are too large for a snake to eat, snakes bite only in self defence. Snake bites usually occur when a person accidentally steps on a snake while out walking. However, sometimes people are bitten when they deliberately provoke a snake by striking it or trying to pick it up.  Read more about the causes of snake bites. Preventing snake bites Follow the advice listed below if you are in an area where venomous snakes are found. look out for warning notices on heaths and commons wear boots and long trousers never pick up a snake, even if you think it's harmless or it appears dead never put your hand in a hole or crevice, for example, between rocks \u2013 if you need to retrieve something, stand well back and use a stick to reach it if you find yourself very close to a snake, stand completely still \u2013 most snakes only strike at moving targets so if you remain calm and still, the snake will escape without harming you In the UK, the adder is the only venomous snake that is found in the wild   How common are snake bites? The World Health Organization estimates that around the world there are millions of venomous snake bites each year, resulting in more than 100,000 deaths each year. However, the total number of snake bites and deaths is likely to be even higher than this. The figures vary widely depending on their source, but the majority of fatalities occur in south and south-east Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, New Guinea and Latin America \u2013 especially in rural farming areas of countries, such as India, where access to emergency medical services is limited or non-existent.  About 100 adder bites are reported in the UK each year. Most bites occur between June and August, with the number of bites peaking during in July. Less than 10 UK residents are bitten by foreign snakes each year, either while travelling abroad or by captive snakes kept in this country. Where are adders found? The adder is common throughout mainland Britain and some islands off the west coast of Scotland. They can be found in: mainland England the Isle of Wight Wales, including Anglesea Scotland, including some of the Inner Hebridean Islands (a group of islands off the west coast of Scotland) Be safe outdoors Get tips on how to prepare for a safe day out cycling in the country or hiking along the coast Page last reviewed: 11\/08\/2014 Next review due: 11\/11\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The noise comes from the soft palate and tissue in the mouth, nose or throat vibrating. Some people snore infrequently and the sound they make isn't particularly loud, while others may snore every night, loud enough to be heard in the next room. Healthcare professionals use grading systems to assess a person\u2019s snoring. The higher the grade, the more severe the snoring is. Read more about the symptoms of snoring. When to see your GP You should see a GP if your snoring is affecting aspects of your life, such as causing excessive tiredness and poor concentration, or relationship problems with your partner. Excessive daytime sleepiness should be taken seriously, because it increases the risk of a road traffic accident. The Department for Transport estimates that one in five road traffic accidents are caused by excessive sleepiness. It can also cause accidents with the use of machinery and vehicles, such as cranes and forklift trucks. Snoring can sometimes indicate a more serious related condition called obstructive sleep apnoea, where a person\u2019s airways repeatedly become partially or totally blocked for about 10 seconds throughout the night. See your GP if you wake up gasping or choking during the night. If your child snores, you should also speak to your GP. Who snores? As many as one in four people in England snore regularly. Snoring can affect people of all ages, including children, although it's more common in adults aged 40-60. Twice as many men than women snore. What causes snoring? Snoring is caused by the vibration of soft tissue in your head and neck as you breathe in and out during sleep. This includes the nasal passages, the soft palate in the roof of your mouth, and your tonsils. While you sleep, your airways relax and narrow. This affects air pressure within your airways and causes the tissue to vibrate. This can also occur if your airways are partially blocked \u2013 for example, if you have a cold. Your chances of snoring can also be increased by factors such as being overweight, drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, and smoking. Read more about the causes of snoring. Treating snoring Treatment can improve snoring in some cases, but a complete cure isn't always possible. Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, are usually recommended first.  Anti-snoring devices, such as mouth guards or nasal strips, may help prevent snoring. Surgery may be an option if anti-snoring devices don't help. This often involves removing the soft tissue that causes snoring, or preventing the tissue from vibrating by causing it to tighten. Surgery for snoring is usually regarded as a treatment of last resort. It's important to be aware that surgery can often have a limited effect that doesn't last longer than one or two years.

It's one of the most common anxiety disorders. Social anxiety disorder is much more than \"shyness\". It can be intense fear and anxiety over simple everyday activities, such as shopping or speaking on the phone. Many people sometimes worry about certain social situations, but someone with social anxiety disorder will worry excessively about them before, during and afterwards. They fear doing or saying something they think will be embarrassing or humiliating, such as blushing, sweating or appearing incompetent. Social anxiety disorder is a type of complex phobia. This type of phobia has a disruptive or disabling impact on a person's life. It can severely affect a person's confidence and self-esteem, interfere with relationships and impair performance at work or school. Social anxiety disorder often starts during childhood or adolescence and tends to be more common in women. It's a recognised disorder that can be effectively treated, so you should see your GP if you think you have it.  Signs of social anxiety disorder A child with social anxiety disorder may cry more than usual, freeze, or have tantrums. They may fear going to school and taking part in classroom activities and school performances. Teens and adults with social anxiety disorder may: dread everyday activities, such as: meeting strangers talking in groups or starting conversations speaking on the telephone talking to authority figures working eating or drinking with company shopping have low self-esteem and feel insecure about their relationships fear being criticised avoid eye-to-eye contact misuse drugs or alcohol to try to reduce their anxiety Panic attacks The fear of a social situation can sometimes build up to a panic attack, where you feel an overwhelming sense of fear, apprehension and anxiety. This usually only lasts a few minutes. You may also experience physical symptoms, such as feeling sick, sweating, trembling and heart palpitations. These symptoms often reach a peak before quickly passing. Although these type of symptoms can be alarming, they don't cause any physical harm. Read more about dealing with panic attacks.  Other mental health problems Many people with social anxiety disorder will also have another mental health problem, such as: depression generalised anxiety disorder panic disorder post-traumatic stress disorder Some people may also have a substance or alcohol misuse problem, because they use drugs or alcohol as a way of coping with their anxiety. What causes social anxiety disorder? As with many mental health conditions, social anxiety disorder is most probably the result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Anxiety disorders often run in families, so you're more likely to have social anxiety disorder if a close family member is affected. However, the exact nature of the relationship between genetics and learned behaviour is uncertain. The behaviour of parents may also have an influence on whether their child will develop social anxiety disorder. If you have worried or anxious parents, it can often affect your ability to cope with anxiety during childhood, adolescence and adulthood. People with social anxiety disorder often describe their parents as: overprotective not affectionate enough constantly criticising them and worrying they may do something wrong overemphasising the importance of manners and grooming exaggerating the danger of approaching strangers Getting help If you think you may have social anxiety disorder, you should try to see your GP for help. Your GP should make it as easy as possible for you to have a consultation with them. For example, they may offer you an assessment over the phone if it's easier, or they may give you an appointment when the surgery is less busy \u2013 for example, before or after normal hours.  If your anxiety is severe, or you'd like your child to be assessed, your GP may be able to visit you at home.  Diagnosing social anxiety disorder Your GP may ask you some questions from a diagnostic questionnaire, such as the Social Phobia Inventory, Social Phobia Scale or Social Interaction Anxiety Scale. These give a score that indicates your level of anxiety in social situations (there are similar scales designed for use on children). The type of questions your GP might ask you are: do you\/does your child tend to avoid social places or activities? do you\/does your child get scared about doing things with other people, like talking, eating and going to parties? do you\/does your child find it difficult to do things when others are watching? Your GP will want to rule out other possible causes of your fear, such as generalised anxiety disorder or agoraphobia (a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or where help wouldn't be available if things go wrong). They'll also want to explore whether you have any other problems that would need to be treated separately, such as depression or an alcohol or drug problem. Read about treating depression, drug misuse and treating alcohol misuse. Treating social anxiety disorder in adults If you've been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, there are a number of different treatment options available. Cognitive behavioural therapy Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective treatments for social anxiety disorder. Generally, CBT works by helping you identify unhelpful and unrealistic beliefs and behavioural patterns. You and your therapist work together to change your behaviour and replace unhelpful beliefs with more realistic and balanced ones. CBT teaches new skills and helps you understand how to react more positively to situations that would usually cause you anxiety. Your therapy sessions may include learning about social anxiety, graduated exposure to feared social situations (which may include some homework), examining and modifying your core beliefs and helping to prevent relapse. CBT involves a considerable time commitment. The exact amount of time required can vary, depending on your specific condition and response to therapy. One example is 15 hourly sessions, plus one of 90 minutes. However, you may require fewer or more sessions, or you may need fewer sessions that last longer. Supported self-help If you wish to try a different psychological therapy, you may be offered supported self-help. This could be in the form of a CBT-based book or computer programme to try over three to four months. One of the most widely-used self-help therapies for people with anxiety or phobias is FearFighter, which is available on the NHS in some areas. You can also pay to do the course privately. Learn more about self-help therapies. Antidepressants Some people may benefit from trying a type of antidepressant medication, usually a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), either instead of or in combination with individual CBT. SSRIs increase the level of serotonin in your brain. They can be taken on a long-term basis. As with all antidepressants, SSRIs can take several weeks to start working. You'll usually be started on a low dose, which will gradually be increased as your body gets used to the medicine. Escitalopram or sertraline are the two SSRIs often prescribed to treat social anxiety disorder. If you're prescribed one of these, you'll initially be asked to see your GP every few weeks to check on your progress and see if you're responding well to it. Common side effects of SSRIs include: feeling agitated, shaky or anxious feeling or being sick indigestion diarrhoea or constipation loss of appetite and weight loss dizziness blurred vision thirst or dry mouth excessive sweating sleeping problems (insomnia) headaches low sex drive (loss of libido) difficulty achieving orgasm during sex or masturbation in men, difficulty obtaining or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) When you and your GP decide that it's appropriate for you to stop taking your SSRI medication, your dose will gradually be reduced. You should only stop taking your medication when your GP advises you to do so. Psychotherapy If all of the above interventions aren't right for you, for whatever reason, you may be offered interpersonal psychotherapy or short-term psychotherapy specifically designed for social anxiety disorder. Psychotherapy generally involves talking to a trained therapist either one-to-one, in a group, or with your wife, husband or partner. It allows you to look deeper into your problems and worries, and deal with troublesome habits and a wide range of mental disorders. Interpersonal psychotherapy aims to link social anxiety to relationship problem areas and address these. You'll probably be offered 16-20 sessions over four to five months. Short-term psychotherapy for social anxiety disorder aims to improve your social skills, and encourage you to face feared social situations outside therapy sessions. A course of treatment usually consists of 25-30 sessions that last 50 minutes, over a six- to eight-month period.  Treating social anxiety disorder in children The psychological therapies offered to adults outlined above should also be considered for children aged 15 and older. Both group-based and individual CBT should take into account how well the child or young person can process thoughts and emotions.  For individual CBT, the recommended number of sessions is eight to 12, each one lasting 45 minutes. Sessions will include gradually exposing the child to feared or avoided social situations and training them in social skills, rehearsing their use in social situations. There will also be training for parents. Group-based CBT may be offered for children and young people aged seven and older. As with individual CBT, group sessions aim to gradually expose affected children to feared or avoided social situations, and train them in social skills. There may be eight to 12 sessions, each lasting 90 minutes. Parent-driven CBT is more appropriate for younger children. Parents are trained to use CBT-based materials with their children, such as books designed to treat their child's anxiety problem.

Tissues that can be affected by soft tissue sarcomas include fat, muscle, blood vessels, deep skin tissues, tendons and ligaments. Soft tissue sarcomas can develop in almost any part of the body, including the legs, arms and the trunk (torso). There are many different types of soft tissue sarcoma, depending on where in the body they are located. For example: leiomyosarcomas \u2013 which develop in muscle tissue liposarcomas \u2013 which develop in fat tissue angiosarcomas \u2013 which develop in the cells of the blood or lymph vessels gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) \u2013 which can develop in the connective tissues that support the organs of the digestive system Soft tissue sarcomas account for around one in every 100 cancers diagnosed in the UK. More than 3,000 new cases are diagnosed every year. What causes soft tissue sarcomas? Cancer develops when cells multiply uncontrollably, forming tumours.  In the vast majority of soft tissue sarcomas it's unclear what causes this to happen but there are a number of factors known to increase the risk, including: age \u2013 soft tissue sarcomas can occur at any age, including in children, but they are more common in middle-aged or elderly people and your risk increases as you get older certain genetic conditions \u2013 some genetic conditions, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and retinoblastoma, are associated with an increased risk of soft tissue sarcomas previous radiotherapy \u2013 some people who have previously had radiotherapy for another type of cancer develop a soft tissue sarcoma, often many years after their previous treatment exposure to certain chemicals \u2013 exposure to some chemicals, including vinyl chloride, dioxins and phenoxyacetic herbicides, has been associated with increased rates of soft tissue sarcomas One particular type of soft tissue sarcoma called Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma \u2013 which develops in skin cells \u2013 is caused by a virus known as the human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) infecting someone with a weakened immune system (such as people with HIV). Signs and symptoms As soft tissue sarcomas can develop in most parts of the body, they can cause a wide range of symptoms. For example, a tumour near the stomach may cause abdominal (tummy) pain, a feeling of fullness and constipation, whereas a tumour near the lungs may cause a cough or breathlessness. There are often no obvious symptoms in the early stages of soft tissue sarcomas, although you may notice a soft, painless lump under your skin or deeper, that can't easily be moved around and gets bigger over time. You should see your GP if you have a worrying lump or any other troublesome symptoms. A lump the size of a golf ball or larger should be regarded as suspicious and needs to be investigated urgently. Although it is much more likely you have a benign (non-cancerous) condition, it is important to get your symptoms checked out. Diagnosing soft tissue sarcomas If your GP feels there is a possibility you do have cancer, they will refer you for a number of hospital tests to confirm whether you have a soft tissue sarcoma. In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of soft tissue sarcoma and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected soft tissue sarcoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral. A diagnosis of a soft tissue sarcoma will usually be made by a hospital specialist and will be based on your symptoms, a physical examination, and the results of: a biopsy \u2013 where a sample of suspected cancerous tissue is removed using a needle or during an operation so it can be tested and analysed in a laboratory imaging tests \u2013 a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is the main type of scan carried out to assess soft tissue sarcomas, although other scans may also be carried out If a diagnosis of a soft tissue sarcoma is confirmed, these tests will also help determine how far the cancer has spread (known as the 'stage') and how aggressive the cancer is (known as the 'grade'). Treating soft tissue sarcomas If you're diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma your care team of specialist doctors and nurses will help you decide on the most appropriate treatment. Treatment depends on factors such as the stage and grade of the cancer, the location of any tumours, and your age and general health. The main treatments used are: surgery \u2013 to remove any tumours radiotherapy \u2013 where high-energy radiation is used to kill cancer cells chemotherapy \u2013 where medication is used to kill cancer cells These treatments are described in more detail below. Surgery Surgery is the main treatment for soft tissue sarcomas that are detected at an early stage. It involves removing the cancerous tumour along with a section of surrounding healthy tissue. This will help ensure no cancer cells are left behind. Every effort will be made to reduce the impact of surgery on the appearance and functionality of the affected body part. But there is a possibility you'll have some difficulty using the part of the body that is operated on after surgery and sometimes reconstructive plastic surgery may be needed to repair significant damage. In a small number of cases, there may be no option but to amputate the part of the body where the cancer is located, such as part of the leg. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy is often used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells. This is carried out using an external machine that directs beams of radiation at a defined treatment area. Radiotherapy may also sometimes be used before surgery to make a tumour easier to remove, or as part of your treatment to reduce your symptoms if surgery is not possible. Common side effects of radiotherapy include sore skin, tiredness and hair loss in the treatment area. These tend to get better within a few days or weeks of treatment finishing. Read more about the side effects of radiotherapy. Chemotherapy Like radiotherapy, chemotherapy is sometimes used before surgery to shrink a tumour and make it easier to remove. This involves being given anti-cancer medication directly into a vein (intravenously). Chemotherapy may also be used alone or alongside radiotherapy for soft tissue sarcomas that cannot be surgically removed. Chemotherapy medications have a poisonous effect on the body's cells, and can cause a number of temporary but unpleasant side effects, such as feeling tired and weak all the time, feeling and being sick, and hair loss from several parts of the body. Read more about the side effects of chemotherapy. Outlook As with most types of cancer, the outlook for a soft tissues sarcoma depends largely on how far the cancer has advanced when it is diagnosed. If the cancer is detected at an early stage and can be removed during surgery, there is a possibility it can be cured. But you'll need regular check-ups following treatment to check for any signs the cancer has come back. You may also need long-term physiotherapy and occupational therapy to help you manage any physical difficulties resulting from surgery. A cure is not usually possible if a soft tissue sarcoma is only detected at a late stage when it has already spread to other parts of the body, although treatment can help slow the spread of the cancer and control your symptoms. Overall, around half of those diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma will live at least five years from the point of their diagnosis. Want to know more?

The soiling usually happens during the day, when the child is awake and active. Although parents may find it frustrating, encopresis is very rarely thought to be caused by a child misbehaving. They usually can't help it and some children may not even realise they've had an accident. Children who have this problem may feel ashamed, guilty, frustrated or angry, and may act secretively to try to hide the problem.   If your child is aged four or older and soiling their clothes, or if they're constipated and reluctant to pass stools, see your GP. In the meantime, you can read on to learn the likely cause of your child's problems and how you can help them. Why is my child doing this? Most children who soil their pants are severely constipated. They may ignore the urge to go to the toilet and \"hold on\" to avoid the pain of passing stools. This leads to faecal impaction \u2013 when a large, solid stool becomes stuck in their rectum (back passage) and begins to stretch and weaken the surrounding muscle walls. Watery stools then leak out from around this blockage. At first, you may just notice streaks in your child's underwear and assume they aren't wiping properly, but it usually gets worse and can lead to entire bowel movements in their underwear. Children who don't get enough fibre and fluids in their diet may be at risk of becoming constipated. However, a poor diet alone is rarely the cause of childhood constipation. Constipation may also be related to a lack of toilet training or toilet training at too early an age. Constantly intervening when your child is using the toilet may make them feel anxious about it and reluctant to go, which only makes the problem worse.  For more information, read about the causes of constipation.  How would my GP diagnose and treat it? Your GP may want to physically examine your child to see if they have faecal impaction. This normally just involves feeling your child's tummy.  Sometimes an X-ray is needed to see how much stool is in your child's bowel and to see if their bowel is enlarged as a result.  If your child has faecal impaction, the first step is to prescribe laxatives to rid their bowel of the hard, retained stools and to prevent further constipation. Your child will also need to follow a balanced diet and be encouraged to pass stools regularly. These treatments are described in more detail below. Medication Your GP may prescribe an osmotic laxative such as macrogol, which is a sachet of powder you dissolve in water for your child to drink. This increases the amount of fluid in your child's bowel to soften their impacted stools and stimulate their body to push them out. Your doctor or nurse will explain how many sachets your child needs to take each day and how much water to add to the powder. Once the powder has been mixed with the water, you may add fruit juice or squash to improve the taste. To start with, your child will be on a higher dose to clear their bowel (disimpaction), then a reducing dose to maintain regular emptying of the bowel. Your doctor will tell you when to stop the medication, but this will be after the dosage has been gradually reduced. If you stop the laxatives abruptly or before your doctor recommends, the bowel may not have recovered to its usual size and function, and your child may become constipated again. Some children may need to continue taking laxatives for several years, and a few children for longer, to completely cure their constipation. The treatment to get rid of impacted stools may initially increase your child's soiling and tummy pain, but it's important to follow the course your doctor has prescribed. There's no evidence to support the commonly held belief that using laxatives produces a \"lazy bowel\". Read more about Movicol, including its side effects. Diet tips Your child should have a well-balanced diet that includes lots of fibre \u2013 fruit, vegetables and wholegrain foods, such as wholemeal bread and pasta. They should also drink plenty of fluids. Read about 5 A DAY and your family. Children with chronic (long-term) constipation normally don't have anything physically wrong with them, but it can take time to correct the problem, so be patient. Healthy toilet habits Try to minimise stress or conflict associated with using the toilet. Establish a regular routine where, for example, they sit on the toilet for 5 to 10 minutes after breakfast and again after dinner every day. Be positive and encouraging about this routine. Also, encourage your child to go to the toilet as soon as they have an urge to go. It might help to make a diary of your child's bowel movements linked to a reward system.

The patches can be pink, red or brown in colour, and can vary in size from a few millimetres to a few centimetres across. The skin in affected areas can sometimes become very thick, and occasionally the patches can look like small horns or spikes. Actinic keratoses are found on areas of skin that are exposed to the sun, such as the: face, especially the nose and forehead forearms and backs of hands in men, on the rims of the ears and bald scalps in women, on the legs below the knees The patches are usually harmless and sometimes get better on their own, but they can be sore, itchy and look unsightly. There is also a small risk that the patches could develop into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma if they're not treated. You should see your GP if you think you may have actinic keratoses, so they can discuss treatment options with you. Who is affected Actinic keratoses are most commonly seen in fair-skinned people, especially those with blue eyes, red hair, freckles and a tendency to burn easily in the sun. Men are affected more often than women. People who have lived or worked abroad in a sunny place, or who have worked outdoors or enjoy outdoor hobbies, are most at risk. It may take many years before actinic keratoses develop \u2013 they don't usually appear before the age of 40. Studies carried out in the UK have suggested that around one in every four or five people over the age of 60 has actinic keratoses. Diagnosing actinic keratoses Your GP may be able to diagnose actinic keratoses by examining the patches on your skin. In some cases, the diagnosis may need to be confirmed by removing a small sample of skin and examining it under the microscope. Actinic keratoses can often be managed by your GP, but you may need to see a skin specialist (dermatologist) for further assessment if: your GP is not certain about your diagnosis your GP thinks one or more of your patches may be cancerous or at a high risk of becoming cancerous your patches are particularly severe or widespread you are taking immunosuppressant drugs \u2013 for example, following an organ transplant your patches have not responded to treatment Treatment options If the patches are not troublesome, your doctor may simply recommend that you keep an eye on them and come back if they change in any way \u2013 for example, if you develop new symptoms such as a patch growing quickly, bleeding or forming an ulcer. However, actinic keratoses are often removed because of concerns they may develop into skin cancer (see below) or, less commonly, for cosmetic reasons. The patches can be removed using a variety of treatments, depending on your individual circumstances. The main treatments used are summarised below. Creams or gels There are a number of creams and gels that can be applied to the skin if you have several patches. Commonly used treatments include 5-fluorouracil cream, imiquimod cream, diclofenac gel and ingenol mebutate gel. These creams and gels are usually applied daily (washing your hands carefully after), often for several weeks, and they cause the abnormal skin cells to die. They may make the skin sore, and it may weep and blister after a few days of treatment.  The various creams and gels seem to be similarly effective in treating actinic keratoses, although the potential side effects and the length of time that treatment is needed differs between each of them. Not all are easily available. Discuss the benefits and risks of the different creams and gels available with your GP before starting treatment. Freezing with liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy) In some cases, freezing the patches (cryotherapy) may be recommended. This causes blistering and shedding of the sun-damaged areas of skin.  The time it takes the skin to heal varies, depending on the areas of the body treated. Some areas may heal in a week or two, whereas others may take a few months to fully heal. A light freeze usually leaves no scar, but thicker lesions or early skin cancer may need longer freezes, which can leave a permanently pale or dark mark. Scraping (curettage)  Curettage is where the abnormal patches are scraped off with a sharp spoon-like instrument called a curette. This procedure is done under a local anaesthetic (where the treated area is numbed) and is generally used to treat thicker patches and early skin cancers, or to help confirm a diagnosis. Cautery (heat treatment) is used to stop any bleeding after the cells have been removed. A scab forms after the procedure, which heals over a few weeks to leave a small scar. The scrapings that are removed can be examined under the microscope to confirm the diagnosis. Cutting it out (excision)  If your doctor suspects the patch may be cancerous or pre-cancerous, they may cut it out using a scalpel under local anaesthetic and close the wound with stitches. The piece of skin is then examined under the microscope to confirm the diagnosis. Removing the patch will leave a permanent scar. Other treatments There are also a number of other treatments that may be effective in treating actinic keratoses, including: photodynamic therapy (PDT) \u2013 where light is shone onto the affected area of skin after a light-activated cream has been applied; the light activates this cream and causes it to form a chemical that kills the abnormal cells laser resurfacing \u2013 where a laser beam is used to remove the abnormal patches of skin dermabrasion \u2013 where specially-designed abrasive instruments are used to remove the abnormal patches chemical peels \u2013 where a corrosive liquid is applied to the affected area of skin to remove the abnormal patches However, these treatments are not in widespread use and there is no clear evidence that they offer any additional benefit. Self-help It is important to protect your skin from the sun if you have actinic keratoses. This can reduce the risk of further patches developing and may help reduce the number of patches you already have. To protect yourself from the sun, you should: apply sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 before exposing yourself to direct sunlight cover up your skin with clothes and a hat during the summer months try to avoid direct exposure to the sun when it is at its strongest (between 11am and 3pm) It may also be helpful to regularly use emollients on your skin to stop it becoming dry. Outlook Actinic keratoses that have been treated usually go away, but it is likely that more patches will develop, requiring further treatment.  The development of actinic keratoses is a sign that the underlying skin is damaged from many years of sun exposure, and this cannot be reversed. It means you have a higher than average risk of developing skin cancer. However, the exact chances of actinic keratoses developing into skin cancer are not clear. Some research has suggested the chances of a patch becoming cancerous are less than 1 in 1,000 every year, whereas other studies suggest the overall chances of actinic keratoses becoming cancerous may be as high as 1 in 10.

They are sometimes termed \"medically unexplained symptoms\" or \"functional\" symptoms when they last for more than a few weeks, but doctors can't find any disease or problem with the body that may be the cause. This doesn't mean that the symptoms are faked or \"all in the head\" \u2013 they are real and can affect your ability to function properly. Not understanding the cause can make them even more distressing and difficult to cope with. Medically unexplained symptoms are surprisingly common, accounting for up to a fifth of all GP consultations in the UK. Why do they happen? Many people suffering from medically unexplained symptoms such as exhaustion (fatigue), pain and heart palpitations also have depression or anxiety disorders. Treating an associated psychological problem can often relieve the physical symptoms. For others, the symptoms may be part of a poorly understood syndrome, such as: chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) \u2013 also known as ME, which causes persistent fatigue irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \u2013 a common condition affecting the digestive system, which can cause stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and\/or constipation fibromyalgia \u2013 which causes pain all over the body A psychological or life problem may play a role in these syndromes as well \u2013 for example, IBS symptoms can be brought on by stress in some people, and managing the stress can help to relieve the symptoms. However, there may be other triggers (for example, IBS and CFS can occur after infections). Sometimes, there is simply no explanation and doctors can't diagnose a cause. This isn't unusual in medicine and doesn't mean that nothing can be done to help you (see \"How can my GP help?\" below). If you're worried that you have an underlying disease that has been missed by your doctor, you can ask for a second opinion. What sort of complaints can be 'unexplained'? Medically unexplained symptoms tend to be quite general problems, such as: fatigue  pain headaches heart palpitations  shortness of breath dizziness and feeling sick  These are often experienced alongside depression and\/or anxiety (see \"What's the connection between mental and physical health?\" below). The symptoms vary in how much they affect people \u2013 some will see their GP with relatively minor symptoms, while others may become disabled by them. Who is more likely to have them? Unexplained symptoms are reported to be more common among: women younger people those who have recently had an infection or physical illness, or those affected by the ill health or death of a relative those who have previously experienced problems such as depression and anxiety  Women are more likely than men to see their GP with symptoms, and some older people don't like to bother their GP. What's the connection between physical and mental health? Just as poor physical health can lead to unhappiness and psychological problems, the opposite is also true. Conditions such as low back pain and IBS are known to be triggered or made worse by psychological problems such as stress, anxiety or depression. This can lead to a vicious circle \u2013 for example, the emotional upset from being in constant physical pain can lead to depression, the depression then worsens the pain, and may trigger other symptoms. How can my GP help?  Your GP will aim to rule out all the possible serious causes of your symptoms. You'll probably have a thorough physical examination and blood tests. It's important to consider whether the cause of your symptoms may be any medication you are taking. Your GP should also investigate whether you might have an associated problem, such as depression or anxiety, that may be causing or worsening your symptoms. You should tell them: what the symptoms are like, when they started and what makes them better or worse what you think or fear is the cause of your symptoms and your expectations of tests and treatments how the symptoms affect what you can do  how upsetting the symptoms are There are then a number of things you can do that may help. You and your GP may need to draw up a personal health plan \u2013 this means agreeing some lifestyle changes and goals that you both think will help your symptoms. You may be referred for a talking therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT aims to help you manage your symptoms by enabling you to understand links between your symptoms, worries, feelings and behaviour. Medication such as antidepressants can be helpful, even if you're not depressed. However, drugs aren't always the answer \u2013 painkillers or sedatives, for example, may lead to dependence. The possible benefits of medication always need to be weighed against the potential side effects. If you feel your GP isn't taking your complaint seriously, you can get a second opinion. What can I do myself to improve my symptoms?  There are things you can do yourself that can improve or even relieve some physical symptoms, such as regular exercise and stress management. Regular exercise \u2013 say, three 20-minute sessions a week \u2013 will at least keep you fit and give you a chance to take a break from other tasks, or just to get out of the house. Many people find that it also boosts their mood (read about exercise for depression). The exact amount of exercise or activity needs to match your current health and capabilities. Managing stress is very important, as this has been linked to problems such as pain and IBS. Learn some relaxation tips to relieve stress. Generally, it should help to plan some pleasurable personal time to unwind \u2013 whatever helps you relax, whether it's yoga classes, meditation or walks in the countryside.  Read five steps to mental wellbeing. Your body has a remarkable ability to recover and there's a good chance that your symptoms will get better in time, even without any specific treatment.  Page last reviewed: 29\/12\/2014 Next review due: 29\/12\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It can be used to treat some skin and eye conditions, as well as certain types of cancer. On their own, the medication and light source are harmless, but when the medication is exposed to the light, it activates and causes a reaction that damages nearby cells. This allows small abnormal areas of tissue to be treated without the need for surgery. Uses of PDT PDT can be used to treat abnormalities in parts of the body a light source can most easily reach, such as the skin, eyes, mouth, oesophagus (gullet) and lungs. Conditions sometimes treated with PDT include: actinic keratoses \u2013 dry scaly patches of skin caused by damage from years of sun exposure that could become cancerous if not treated Bowen's disease \u2013 a very early form of skin cancer basal cell carcinoma \u2013 a type of skin cancer macular degeneration \u2013 an eye condition that can lead to vision loss Barrett's oesophagus \u2013 changes in the cells in the lining of your lower oesophagus that could become cancerous if not treated oesophageal cancer, mouth cancer and lung cancer \u2013 PDT can cure some cancers if used in the early stages, or offer relief from symptoms in more advanced cases PDT also shows promise in treating some other types of cancer, as well as conditions such as warts and acne. Despite the claims relating to unproven \u201Calternative\u201D forms of PDT, such as next-generation PDT and sonodynamic therapy, PDT is not effective at treating widespread conditions or those affecting deeper parts of the body where a light source cannot reach. In these cases, surgery, radiotherapy, and\/or chemotherapy may be recommended instead. What happens PDT is carried out in two stages. First, you will need to come into the hospital or clinic to be given the light-sensitive medication. Depending on the area of the body being treated, this can be a cream, injection or special drink. Once the medication has been applied or given, you may be asked to go home and return in a few hours or days. This will give the medication a chance to build-up in the abnormal or cancerous cells that are going to be treated. Later, you will need to return to the hospital or clinic for the light treatment. This will involve a lamp or laser being shone onto the treatment area for around 10-45 minutes. To treat abnormal cells inside your body, such as in your lungs, an endoscope (flexible tube) will be passed into your body to deliver the light. After treatment You will usually be able to go home the same day you have the light treatment. If your skin was treated, it will be covered by a dressing that will need to remain in place for at least two days. You should try to avoid scratching or knocking the treated area, and keep it as dry as possible. Once you are advised to remove the dressing, you should be able to wash and bathe as normal, although you should make sure you pat the treated area dry gently. A follow-up appointment at the hospital or clinic will be arranged to assess whether the treatment has been effective and decide if it needs to be repeated. It will usually take around two to six weeks for the area to heal completely. Risks and side effects PDT is generally a very safe treatment. However, it\u2019s common to experience a burning or stinging sensation while the light treatment is being carried out. This will usually pass soon after the treatment finishes. PDT can also make your skin or eyes sensitive to light for up to six weeks, even if the area treated was inside your body. This means they may become red and sore when exposed to direct sunlight or bright indoor lights. Your treatment team will advise you about things you should do to protect your eyes and skin. Other potential side effects will depend on the area treated. For example, if your skin is treated, it may crust over, and become temporarily red, swollen or blistered after treatment. Your skin may also become slightly darker or lighter than it was before and there may be some hair loss. This is usually temporary, but it can sometimes be permanent. Treatment of the mouth, oesophagus and lungs can cause temporary coughing, difficulty swallowing, painful breathing, or breathlessness. If your eyes are treated, there is a small risk of permanent vision loss. Make sure you talk to your doctors about the possible risks and benefits of PDT before you agree to treatment. Next-generation PDT (NGPDT) and sonodynamic therapy (SDT) PDT as described above is an effective and licensed treatment for a number of conditions. It should not be confused with the unproven, unlicensed versions sold by some private clinics in the UK and overseas. Clinics promoting these so-called \"advanced\" versions of PDT, called \"next-generation PDT\" (NGPDT) and \"sonodynamic therapy\" (SDT) claim they can treat deep or widespread cancers, but these claims aren't supported by scientific evidence and these treatments aren't recommended.

A lip balm containing petroleum or beeswax will provide a barrier and help seal in moisture. More moisture is lost through the lips than through any other part of the face or body. When the lips lose moisture, the skin covering them can become tight and start to split. What not to do It's very tempting to pick and bite off flakes of dried skin, but this will only make your lips bleed and heal more slowly. Irritating the skin around your mouth may also trigger a cold sore if you're prone to getting them. It's also tempting to keep licking dry or cracked lips. But this will only dry your lips more, as the saliva evaporates and the repeated licking or wetting \"washes\" the natural grease off the skin. How to treat dry or sore lips The best thing to do if you have dry or sore lips is to regularly apply a lip balm containing petroleum or beeswax. You may need to try a few different products before you find one that works for you. For example, you may be sensitive to fragranced products, in which case non-fragranced lip balms are available. If you're going to be spending time outdoors in the sun, choose a lip balm with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 to help protect your lips. Lip balm acts as a shield to protect your lips against the sun, wind and cold or dry air. It will trap moisture and seal cracks against infection. Avoid lip balms in pots \u2013 repeatedly dipping your finger into the balm can introduce germs. Covering your lips with a scarf when you're outside during the winter can also help prevent dry lips. When dry lips become inflamed Sometimes dry lips can become inflamed and feel sore. The medical term for inflamed lips is cheilitis. Lips usually become inflamed as a result of mild irritation. They can also become inflamed if they're infected with bacteria or fungi that have entered cracks in the skin of the lips. If the corners of your mouth are red and sore, you may have a type of inflammation called angular cheilitis. This is often caused by bacteria or fungi and is treated with ointments applied to the area. Angular cheilitis can sometimes be a symptom of a type of eczema called contact dermatitis, and is more common in people who wear dentures. It's also more common in older people \u2013 with age, the creases around the corners of the mouth become more pronounced, and saliva can build up in the crevices and irritate the skin. When to see your GP See your GP if your lips are red and sore and you think they're infected. They may prescribe an antibiotic or antifungal cream to treat the infection. This may also contain 1% hydrocortisone (steroid medication) to reduce the inflammation. If you have a non-healing persistent sore, this should be seen by your GP as soon as possible.

They normally get better within a week. Most are caused by minor illnesses such as colds or flu and can be treated at home. This page covers: Treatments and remedies Causes of a sore throat When to get medical advice When to get emergency help Treatments for a sore throat The following measures can often help soothe a sore throat: take ibuprofen or paracetamol \u2013 paracetamol is better for children and for people who can't take ibuprofen (note that children under 16 should never take aspirin) drink plenty of cool or warm fluids, and avoid very hot drinks eat cool, soft foods avoid smoking and smoky places gargle with a homemade mouthwash of warm, salty water suck lozenges, hard sweets, ice cubes or ice lollies \u2013 but don't give young children anything small and hard to suck because of the risk of choking There are also products such as medicated lozenges and sprays sold in pharmacies that you may want to try. There isn't much scientific evidence to suggest they help, although some people find them worth using. Antibiotics aren't usually prescribed for a sore throat, even if it's caused by a bacterial infection, as they're unlikely to make you feel better any quicker and they can have unpleasant side effects. Causes of a sore throat The cause of a sore throat isn't always obvious. But in most cases it's a symptom of a viral or bacterial infection. Common causes A sore throat is often a symptom of: colds or flu \u2013 you may also have a blocked or runny nose, a cough, a high temperature (fever), a headache and general aches laryngitis (inflammation of the voice box) \u2013 you may also have a hoarse voice, a dry cough and a constant need to clear your throat tonsillitis (inflammation of the tonsils) \u2013 you may also have red or spotty tonsils, discomfort when swallowing and a fever strep throat (a bacterial throat infection) \u2013 you may also have swollen glands in your neck, discomfort when swallowing and tonsillitis glandular fever \u2013 you may also feel very tired and have a fever and swollen glands in your neck It may also be caused by something irritating your throat, such as smoke, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (where acid leaks up from the stomach) and allergies. Less common causes Less often, a sore throat can be a sign of: quinsy (a painful collection of pus at the back of the throat) \u2013 the pain may be severe and you may also have difficulty opening your mouth or difficulty swallowing epiglottitis (inflammation of the flap of tissue at the back of the throat) \u2013 the pain may be severe and you may have difficulty breathing and difficulty swallowing These conditions are more serious and should be seen by a doctor as soon as possible (see below). When to get medical advice You don't usually need to get medical advice if you have a sore throat. But it's a good idea to contact your GP or NHS 111 if: your symptoms are severe you have persistent symptoms that haven't started to improve after a week you experience severe sore throats frequently you have a weak immune system \u2013 for example, you have HIV, are having chemotherapy, or are taking medication that suppresses your immune system When to get emergency help Very rarely, a sore throat can be a sign of a serious problem. Visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department or call 999 for an ambulance immediately if: your symptoms are severe or getting worse quickly you have difficulty breathing you're making a high-pitched sound as you breathe (called stridor) you have difficulty swallowing you start drooling Page last reviewed: 04\/07\/2016 Next review due: 04\/07\/2019 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

In most cases, it's caused by infection. The epiglottis is a flap of tissue that sits beneath the tongue at the back of the throat. Its main function is to close over the windpipe (trachea) while you're eating, to prevent food entering your airways. Symptoms of epiglottitis The symptoms of epiglottitis usually develop quickly and get rapidly worse, although they can develop over a few days in older children and adults. Symptoms include: a severe sore throat difficulty and pain when swallowing difficulty breathing, which may improve when leaning forwards breathing that sounds abnormal and high-pitched (stridor) a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above irritability and restlessness muffled or hoarse voice drooling The main symptoms of epiglottitis in young children are breathing difficulties, stridor and a hoarse voice. In adults and older children, the main signs are a severe sore throat, swallowing difficulties and drooling. When to seek medical advice Epiglottitis is regarded as a medical emergency, as a swollen epiglottis can restrict the oxygen supply to your lungs. Dial 999 to ask for an ambulance if you think you or your child has epiglottitis. While waiting for an ambulance, you shouldn't attempt to examine your child's throat, place anything inside their mouth or lay them on their back, because this may make their symptoms worse. It's important to keep them calm and to try not to cause panic or distress. Epiglottitis can be fatal if the throat becomes completely blocked. However, with appropriate treatment, most people make a full recovery. Treating epiglottitis Epiglottitis is treated in hospital. The first thing the medical team will do is secure the person's airways, to make sure they can breathe properly. Securing the airways An oxygen mask will be given to deliver highly concentrated oxygen to the person's lungs. If this doesn't work, a tube will be placed in the patient's mouth and pushed past their epiglottis into the windpipe. The tube will be connected to an oxygen supply. In severe cases, where there's an urgent need to secure the airways, a small cut may be made in the neck, at the front of the windpipe, so a tube can be inserted. The tube is then connected to an oxygen supply. This procedure is called a tracheostomy and it allows oxygen to enter the lungs while bypassing the epiglottis. An emergency tracheostomy can be carried out using local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic. Once the airways have been secured and the person is able to breathe unrestricted, a more comfortable and convenient way of assisting breathing may be found. This is usually achieved by threading a tube through the nose and into the windpipe. Fluids will be supplied through a drip into one of your veins, until the person is able to swallow. Once this has been achieved and the situation is thought to be safe, some tests may be carried out, such as: a fibre-optic laryngoscopy \u2013 a flexible tube with a camera attached to one end (laryngoscope) is used to examine the throat a throat swab \u2013 to test for any bacteria or viruses blood tests \u2013 to check the number of white blood cells (a high number indicates there may an infection) and to identify any traces of bacteria or viruses in the blood an X-ray or a computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 sometimes used to check the level of swelling The underlying infection will then be treated with a course of antibiotics, and most people with epiglottitis are well enough to leave hospital after five to seven days. With prompt treatment, most people recover from epiglottitis after about a week and are usually well enough to leave hospital after five to seven days. Why it happens Epiglottitis is usually caused by an infection with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria. As well as epiglottitis, Hib can cause a number of serious infections, such as pneumonia and meningitis. It spreads in the same way as the cold or flu virus; the bacteria are in the tiny droplets of saliva and mucus propelled into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You catch the infection by breathing in these droplets or, if the droplets have landed on a surface or object, by touching this surface and then touching your face or mouth. Less common causes of epiglottitis include: other bacterial infections \u2013 such as streptococcus pneumoniae (a common cause of pneumonia) fungal infections \u2013 people with a weakened immune system are most at risk from these types of infection viral infections \u2013 such as the varicella zoster virus (the virus responsible for chickenpox) and the herpes simplex virus (the virus responsible for cold sores) trauma to the throat \u2013 such as a blow to the throat, or burning the throat by drinking very hot liquids smoking \u2013 particularly illegal drugs, such as cannabis or crack cocaine Hib vaccination The most effective way to prevent your child getting epiglottitis is to make sure their vaccinations are up to date. Children are particularly vulnerable to a Hib infection, because they have an underdeveloped immune system. Children should receive their Hib as part of the 5 in 1 DTaP\/IPV\/Hib vaccine, which also protects against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and polio. Children should receive three doses of the vaccine: one at two months, one when they are three months and one when they are four months old. This is followed by an additional Hib\/Men C \"booster\" vaccine at 12 months. As children from developing countries may not have received the vaccination, children who have immigrated to the UK should take part in the UK immunisation programme. Contact your GP if you are not sure whether your child\u2019s vaccinations are up to date. Read more about the childhood vaccination schedule. Who is affected Because of the success of the Hib vaccination programme, epiglottitis is rare in the UK, and most cases now occur in adults. Deaths from epiglottitis are also rare, occurring in less than 1 in 100 cases. During 2013-14, around 600 people were admitted to hospitals in England with acute epiglottitis.

In most cases, it gets better without treatment in about a week. Symptoms of laryngitis can begin suddenly and usually get worse over a period of two to three days. Common symptoms of laryngitis include: hoarseness difficulty speaking sore throat mild fever irritating cough a constant need to clear your throat The hoarse voice and speaking difficulties usually get worse each day you're ill and may last for up to a week after the other symptoms have gone. In a few cases, the larynx can swell and cause breathing difficulties. This isn't common in adults but can occur in young children who have smaller, narrower windpipes. Laryngitis is often linked to another illness, such as a cold, flu, throat infection (pharyngitis) or tonsillitis, so you might also have other symptoms such as: a headache swollen glands runny nose pain when swallowing feeling tired and achy When to seek medical help As laryngitis often gets better quickly without treatment, you normally only need to see your GP if the symptoms are particularly severe or they last longer than two weeks. You should seek immediate medical help if you or your child experience breathing difficulties. If you see your GP, they'll discuss the possible causes with you and may refer you for tests or to a specialist in hospital. Read more about diagnosing laryngitis. Why it happens In most cases, laryngitis is caused by either:  a viral infection \u2013 such as a cold or flu, or  damage to your larynx \u2013 usually by straining your voice In these cases, most of the symptoms usually pass within a week. This is known as acute laryngitis. Laryngitis can occasionally have other causes, such as smoking, alcohol misuse or an allergic reaction, and the symptoms can last much longer. This is known as chronic laryngitis. Read more about the causes of laryngitis. How laryngitis is treated Most cases of laryngitis get better without treatment within a week. To help your vocal cords heal, it's important not to smoke, to avoid smoky environments, drink plenty of fluids (particularly water) and try to rest your voice as much as possible. In some cases, it may be possible to treat the underlying cause of laryngitis.

Read more about treating laryngitis. Can laryngitis be prevented? As laryngitis is often caused by a common viral infection, such as a cold or flu, it's not always possible to prevent it. However, you can reduce your risk of developing the condition by: making sure you have the annual flu vaccine (if recommended by your GP) practising good personal hygiene \u2013 such as washing your hands before and after eating and after using the toilet avoiding close contact with people who have respiratory infections, such as a cold or flu \u2013 particularly if you're prone to laryngitis avoiding irritants, such as smoke or dust \u2013 particularly if you have a cold or other respiratory tract infection not smoking not drinking more than the recommended limits of alcohol consumption not regularly clearing your throat \u2013 as this can irritate the larynx (try swallowing instead) raising your head with pillows when you're sleeping \u2013 to protect your larynx from any acid reflux from your stomach during sleep not shouting or singing loudly or for long periods of time \u2013 it's important for people who regularly use their voice excessively to receive proper training so they don't damage their larynx The larynx The larynx, or voice box, is a tube-like structure found at the entrance of the windpipe (trachea). The lump at the front of your throat, commonly known as the Adam\u2019s apple, is your larynx. The larynx has three main functions: it helps channel oxygen into your windpipe when you breathe it acts like a valve, closing off the windpipe when you swallow to prevent food or liquid entering your airways it contains the vocal cords which vibrate as air passes through them, producing the sound of your voice Page last reviewed: 08\/09\/2015 Next review due: 08\/09\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The abscess (a collection of pus) forms between one of your tonsils and the wall of your throat. This can happen when a bacterial infection spreads from an infected tonsil to the surrounding area. Quinsy can occur at any age, but most commonly affects teenagers and young adults. It's possible to get it more than once. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of quinsy can include: a severe and quickly worsening sore throat, usually on one side swelling inside the mouth and throat difficulty opening your mouth pain when swallowing difficulty swallowing, which may cause you to drool changes to your voice or difficulty speaking bad breath earache on the affected side headache and feeling generally unwell difficulty breathing Some people with quinsy may also have a high temperature (fever), although this sometimes passes before the abscess develops. When to see your GP You should see your GP if you or your child have symptoms of quinsy. Your GP will ask you about your symptoms and examine your throat and tonsils. These are the two small glands found at the back of your throat, behind your tongue. If quinsy is suspected, you will be referred immediately to a hospital ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for further tests and treatment. It's important that quinsy is diagnosed and treated quickly to prevent the infection from spreading and to avoid serious problems caused by severe swelling, such as breathing difficulties. Treating quinsy People with quinsy usually need to be treated in hospital. Depending on how severe the infection is, you may need to stay in hospital for a few days and rest at home for a week or two afterwards. Medication You will be given antibiotics to clear the infection. These will usually be given directly into a vein (intravenously) at first, but you may switch to a short course of tablets or capsules once you are well enough leave hospital. Painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, will be given to help ease any pain. You can continue to take these while you recover at home if necessary. Occasionally, corticosteroid medication may also be used to help reduce the swelling in your throat. Surgery and procedures In many cases, antibiotics alone are not effective, and it may be necessary to drain the pus from the abscess. This can be done by: needle aspiration \u2013 a long, fine needle is used to draw out the pus incision and drainage \u2013 a small cut (incision) is made over the affected area to drain the pus a tonsillectomy \u2013 an operation to remove your tonsils (this is rarely necessary while you have quinsy, but is often recommended at least six weeks after you\u2019ve recovered) You will often remain awake during a needle aspiration or incision and drainage procedure, but you will be given either a sedative to help you relax and\/or a local anaesthetic to numb the area being treated. Tonsillectomies and some incision and drainage procedures are carried out under general anaesthetic. This means you will be asleep and won't feel any pain while these procedures are carried out. Preventing quinsy One of the best ways to prevent quinsy is to reduce your risk of developing tonsillitis. You can help do this by avoiding close contact with people who have viral or bacterial infections that cause tonsillitis, regularly washing your hands with soap and warm water, and not sharing glasses or utensils with people who are ill. Smoking may increase your risk of quinsy, so stopping smoking may reduce your chances of getting it. Using antibiotics to treat viral tonsillitis doesn't significantly reduce the risk of quinsy and isn't routinely recommended.

It's usually caused by a viral infection or, less commonly, a bacterial infection. Tonsillitis is a common condition in children, teenagers and young adults. The symptoms of tonsillitis include: a sore throat and pain when swallowing earache high temperature (fever) over 38C (100.4F) coughing headache Symptoms usually pass within three to four days. When to see your GP Tonsillitis isn't usually a serious condition. You only need to see your GP if symptoms: last longer than four days and don't show any signs of improvement are severe \u2013 for example, if you're unable to eat or drink due to the pain, or you have difficulty breathing Your GP will examine your throat and ask you some questions about your symptoms. If necessary, a throat swab can be taken to confirm the diagnosis. The results usually take a few days to return. If your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, they may prescribe antibiotics. Typical signs of a bacterial infection include white pus-filled spots on the tonsils, no cough and swollen or tender lymph glands. If you develop severe tonsillitis as a teenager or adult, your GP may recommend a blood test for glandular fever. The tonsils The tonsils are two small glands that sit on either side of the throat. In young children, they help to fight germs and act as a barrier against infection. When the tonsils become infected, they isolate the infection and stop it spreading further into the body. As a child's immune system develops and gets stronger, the tonsils become less important and usually shrink. In most people, the body is able to fight infection without the tonsils. Removal of the tonsils is usually only recommended if they're causing problems, such as severe or repeated episodes of tonsillitis (see below). What causes tonsillitis? Most cases of tonsillitis are caused by a viral infection, such as the viruses that cause the common cold or flu virus (influenza). Some cases can also be caused by a bacterial infection, typically a strain of bacteria called group A streptococcus bacteria. These types of infections spread easily, so it's important to try to avoid passing the infection on to others by: staying away from public places, such as work, school or nursery, until your GP says it's safe to return (usually after the symptoms have passed) coughing and sneezing into a tissue and disposing of the tissue  washing hands before eating, after going to the toilet and, if possible, after coughing and sneezing Read more about the causes of tonsillitis. Treating tonsillitis There's no specific treatment for tonsillitis, but you may be able to reduce the symptoms by: taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to help relieve pain drinking plenty of fluids getting plenty of rest If test results show that your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, a short course of oral antibiotics may be prescribed. If oral antibiotics aren't effective at treating bacterial tonsillitis, intravenous antibiotics (given directly into a vein) may be needed in hospital. Chronic tonsillitis In most cases, tonsillitis gets better within a week. However, a small number of children and adults have tonsillitis for longer, or it keeps returning. This is known as chronic tonsillitis and surgical treatment may be needed. Surgery to remove the tonsils (a tonsillectomy) is usually only recommended if: you've had several severe episodes of tonsillitis over a long period of time repeated episodes are disrupting normal activities Read more about treating tonsillitis. Complications of tonsillitis Complications of tonsillitis are rare and usually only occur if it's caused by a bacterial infection. They're usually the result of the infection spreading to another part of the body. Possible complications of tonsillitis include: a middle ear infection (otitis media) \u2013 where fluid between the eardrum and inner ear becomes infected by bacteria quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) \u2013 an abscess (collection of pus) that develops between one of the tonsils and the wall of the throat obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) \u2013 where the walls of the throat relax during sleep, which causes breathing difficulties and poor sleep Other complications of tonsillitis are very rare and usually only occur if an underlying bacterial infection is left untreated. They include: scarlet fever \u2013 a condition that causes a distinctive pink-red skin rash rheumatic fever \u2013 this causes widespread inflammation throughout the body, leading to symptoms such as joint pain, rashes and jerky body movements glomerulonephritis \u2013 an infection (swelling) of the filters in the kidneys that can cause vomiting and a loss of appetite Page last reviewed: 29\/12\/2015 Next review due: 29\/12\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

If the pain is persistent and you haven't accidentally bitten or burnt your tongue, see your GP or dentist. There may be an underlying problem that needs treating, and your GP or dentist may be able to advise you about pain relief while you wait for it to get better. This page outlines the most likely causes of tongue pain, but you shouldn't use it to diagnose yourself with a condition \u2013 always leave that to a healthcare professional. Common causes Common causes of tongue pain are outlined below. Geographic tongue Also known as benign migratory glossitis or oral erythema migrans, geographic tongue is a common condition that causes irregular red patches surrounded by white lines to develop on the tongue, giving it a map-like appearance. In some people, the red patches may feel sore or sensitive to certain foods and drinks. You may notice that after a few days, weeks or months the position of these lines and patches change. They may disappear and re-appear later on a different part of the tongue. Some people find the condition improves over time, while for others it may be persistent. See your GP or dentist if you have persistent discoloured or painful patches on your tongue. It\u2019s not clear exactly what causes geographic tongue and there is no specific treatment for it, but you may be able to manage the pain by taking over-the-counter painkillers (speak to your pharmacist for advice) and avoiding anything that makes it worse, such as acidic, spicy or hot foods. Oral thrush Oral thrush is an infection in the mouth caused by a fungus, which can cause a coated or white tongue and areas of soreness. You are more likely to develop oral thrush if you: have recently taken antibiotics have poor oral hygiene wear dentures (false teeth), particularly if they don't fit properly have a weakened immune system have diabetes You should see your GP if you think you have oral thrush. If it is left untreated, the symptoms will persist and your mouth will continue to be uncomfortable. Oral thrush is treated with antifungal medicines taken for around a week. These usually come in the form of gels or liquid that you apply directly inside your mouth, although tablets or capsules are sometimes used. Aphthous mouth ulcers Aphthous mouth ulcers are painful sores that can occur anywhere within the mouth and are common on the underside of the tongue. Many mouth ulcers are caused by damage to the mouth, such as from accidentally biting your tongue or eating something hard and sharp. Ulcers that keep recurring have been linked to things such as stress, anxiety, hormone changes, certain foods and stopping smoking. Read more about the causes of mouth ulcers. Most mouth ulcers heal within a week or two and you may be able to manage the pain in the meantime by taking over-the-counter painkillers and avoiding anything that worsens it, such as spicy foods. See your GP or dentist if you have an ulcer that doesn\u2019t improve within a few weeks or if you develop ulcers regularly. Less common causes Less commonly, tongue pain may be caused by: a viral infection \u2013 such as an infection by viruses that cause hand, foot and mouth disease or cold sores vitamin deficiencies and anaemia \u2013 a sore tongue can sometimes be a symptom of iron deficiency anaemia and vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia median rhomboid glossitis \u2013 where a smooth, red, inflamed patch develops on the middle or back of the tongue, thought to result from a fungal infection glossodynia or \"burning mouth syndrome\" \u2013 a burning pain on the tip of the tongue that is often seen in people with depression glossopharyngeal neuralgia \u2013 repeated episodes of severe tongue pain believed to be caused by nerve irritation lichen planus \u2013 a long-term skin condition that causes an itchy rash and can also affect the mouth, causing a white lacy pattern and painful patches on the tongue Behçet's disease \u2013 a rare condition that causes inflammation of the blood vessels and can also lead to painful mouth ulcers  pemphigus vulgaris \u2013 a rare and serious condition that causes painful blisters to develop on the skin, as well as inside the mouth, nose, throat, anus and genitals medications \u2013 painful mouth ulcers can be a side effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and beta-blockers, and certain mouthwashes can cause tongue pain in some people Moeller's glossitis \u2013 a type of inflammation of the tongue cancer of the tongue \u2013 although this is rare Click on the above links for more information about these conditions and medications.

The condition can vary quite a lot. For example, some people find loud noises extremely uncomfortable, some find certain noises particularly annoying, some develop a fear of certain noises, while others experience pain when hearing ordinary sounds. Hyperacusis affects people of all ages and is quite common in children. The condition may just be a minor nuisance for some, but for many it can have a major impact on their life. This page covers: Symptoms of hyperacusis When to get medical help Treatments for hyperacusis Causes of hyperacusis Symptoms of hyperacusis Hyperacusis can either start suddenly or develop gradually over time. When someone with the condition hears noise, they may: feel uncomfortable cover their ears or try to get away from the noise feel angry, tense, distressed, or anxious experience pain \u2013 hyperacusis can be very painful for some people Some people become afraid of sound and avoid noisy situations, causing them to become socially isolated. School and work life can also suffer as it can be very difficult to concentrate. When to get medical help Visit your GP if you have a severe sound intolerance. They can examine your ears and refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) consultant or a hearing specialist (audiologist) for tests if necessary. There are no tests that can definitively diagnose hyperacusis, but you may be asked to fill in a questionnaire about your symptoms and have a hearing test to determine what level of sound causes a reaction. Treatments for hyperacusis There are no specific medicines or operations that can treat hyperacusis, although treating any underlying cause may help resolve the problem. If there's no clear cause, specialist techniques to help reduce your sensitivity to noise may be recommended. These therapies are widely available privately, and may be available on the NHS for people with severe or persistent hyperacusis. They should only be carried out by someone specially trained in the correct techniques. Treatment may involve: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013 this aims to help you explore and change the way you think about the troublesome noises to reduce distress, change your avoidance behaviour, and help you recover from your hyperacusis symptoms   counselling and education \u2013 to support you and help you learn more about your hyperacusis sound therapy (desensitisation) \u2013 this aims to help desensitise your hearing over several months, using special noise generators either placed in the room or in your ears (similar to hearing aids) lifestyle changes \u2013 including learning relaxation techniques, listening to calming music or sounds, not avoiding noisy situations, and not using earplugs or muffs (these may make your ears more sensitive) Recent research suggests patients often feel CBT, counselling and education are the most effective treatments. Some people also found sound therapy helpful, but it wasn't clear whether it provided any additional benefit. You may also find it helpful to get in touch with a support group, such as the British Tinnitus Association and Action on Hearing Loss, to talk to other people with hyperacusis and share your experiences. Causes of hyperacusis The cause of hyperacusis is unclear. It has been linked with a number of other conditions, although many people with hyperacusis don't have any other obvious problems. Hyperacusis has been associated with: tinnitus \u2013 hearing sounds that come from inside your body, rather than from an outside source hearing loss \u2013 the brain may sometimes compensate for reduced hearing by amplifying signals coming from the ears damage to the ear or brain \u2013 including from a head injury, ear surgery, exposure to loud noise, earwax removal, glue ear, and persistent ear infections migraines Bell's palsy \u2013 a type of facial paralysis Ménière's disease \u2013 a disorder of the inner ear that causes a spinning sensation (vertigo), tinnitus, and hearing loss depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Addison's disease \u2013 a rare disorder of the adrenal glands, which sit near the kidneys and produce important hormones disorders affecting the brain \u2013 such as Williams' syndrome or autism spectrum disorder Hyperacusis can also be a side effect of certain medications. If you're taking any medication, check the leaflet it comes with to see if hyperacusis is listed as a possible side effect.

HSP is also known as familial spastic paraparesis or Strümpell-Lorrain syndrome. A person with HSP is likely to have inherited an abnormal gene from their parents that causes the long nerves in their spine to deteriorate. These nerves control voluntary movement, so the muscles in the lower body don't receive the correct messages telling them to relax or contract. It leads to spasticity (stiff and rigid muscles) and weakness in the leg muscles, which progressively gets worse. Most forms of HSP mainly affect the lower body. The arms and hands are usually unaffected. On average, the symptoms of HSP start in mid-adulthood, although it can start as late as the age of 70 or in young children. What are the symptoms? Symptoms vary depending on the type of spastic paraplegia inherited. At first there may just be mild stiffness and slight difficulty with walking, which slowly worsens to uncontrollable shaking of the legs when walking, poor balance and unsteadiness. Many people with HSP develop foot drop, where they have difficulty lifting their toes and end up dragging them when they walk. They may keep tripping, especially if walking on uneven ground. Some may eventually need a walking aid or wheelchair, although not everyone will. Other symptoms in HSP are fatigue and bladder problems, such as urinary incontinence or a sense of urgency. How is it inherited? Most people with HSP will have inherited an abnormal gene from their parents. Occasionally, HSP occurs as a result of a new DNA error (mutation) when a child is conceived. In most cases, a child with HSP will have inherited the faulty gene from just one of their parents, and this dominates the corresponding normal gene they inherit from the other parent. This is known as autosomal dominant inheritance. Sometimes adults will carry a weaker version of the abnormal gene, which means they don't have symptoms but can pass on HSP to their children.  In some cases, a single copy of the faulty gene does not cause HSP. In these cases, children only develop HSP if they inherit the abnormal genes from both of their parents. This is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. About 70-80% of cases of HSP result from autosomal dominant inheritance, and the remainder from autosomal recessive inheritance. Can HSP be treated? HSP cannot be prevented, slowed or reversed, but treatments can relieve some symptoms and help the person manage day-to-day activities. For example: muscle relaxants such as baclofentizandine and botulinum (Botox) injections can help relieve spasticity regular physiotherapy is important for muscle strength and range of movement occupational therapy can help the person carry out daily activities more easily and regain as much independence as possible a lower leg brace (ankle-foot orthosis) can help foot drop (read more about the treatment of foot drop) surgery may occasionally be needed to release tendons or shortened muscles Outlook The outlook for people with HSP varies. Some people are very disabled and need a wheelchair, while others only have a mild disability and don't need any walking aid. Generally, many people with HSP lead relatively independent and active lives, even if they do need a wheelchair. HSP does not usually affect life expectancy. Information about you If you or your child has HSP, your clinical team will pass information about you\/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Having a low sperm count can make it more difficult to conceive naturally, although successful pregnancies can still occur. Problems with sperm, including a low sperm count and problems with sperm quality, are quite common. They're a factor in around one in three couples who are struggling to get pregnant. There are treatments available on the NHS or privately that can help you become a dad if you have a low sperm count. This page covers: Getting tested Home-testing kits Causes Treatments Getting your sperm count checked See your GP if you have not managed to conceive after one year of trying for a baby. It's a good idea for both you and your partner to get advice, as fertility problems can affect men and women and often it's a combination of both. It's important to understand what the exact issue is before you decide on your next steps. One of the tests your GP can arrange is a semen analysis. This is where a sample of your semen is analysed in a laboratory to check the quality and quantity of the sperm. The results are usually available within a week. If the results are abnormal, the test should be repeated to ensure it was accurate. This will normally be performed after three months. Your GP can refer you to a specialist in male infertility at your local hospital or fertility clinic if any problems are found. Home sperm count testing kits There are several male fertility home-testing kits available to buy from pharmacies. These tests claim to indicate whether your sperm count is low. It may be tempting to try one of the tests if you would rather not see your GP, but you should be aware that: although research by the manufacturers suggests these tests can give an accurate indication of sperm count, they haven't been extensively studied some home-testing kits classify a low sperm count as under 20 million sperm per millilitre of semen, but more recent international guidelines state that anything above 15 million sperm per millilitre of semen is normal home-testing kits only check the number of sperm, not other things that can affect fertility, such as how well the sperm are able to move (motility) While these tests might sometimes give a useful indication of your sperm count, they may also give you false reassurance or may suggest your sperm count is low when it's actually perfectly normal. It's better to see your GP for a proper semen analysis at an accredited laboratory if you're concerned about your fertility. See how to use self-test kits safely for more about the issues of home-testing. Causes of a low sperm count In many cases, it's not obvious what causes a low sperm count. Sometimes problems with sperm count and quality are associated with: a hormone imbalance, such as hypogonadism (reduced hormone production) a genetic problem such as Klinefelter syndrome having had undescended testicles as a baby a structural problem \u2013 for example, the tubes that carry sperm being damaged and blocked by illness or injury, or being absent from birth a genital infection such as chlamydia, gonorrhoea or prostatitis (infection of the prostate gland) varicoceles (enlarged veins in the testicles) previous surgery to the testicles or hernia repairs  the testicles becoming overheated excessive alcohol consumption, smoking and using drugs such as marijuana or cocaine certain medications, including testosterone replacement therapy, long-term anabolic steroid use, cancer medications (chemotherapy), some antibiotics and some antidepressants Treatments for low sperm count If you or your partner has been diagnosed with a low sperm count, there are several options available. Keep trying Your doctor may initially suggest trying to conceive naturally for a little longer. Many couples conceive within the second year of trying. You can help maximise your chances of conceiving by: having sex every two or three days moderating your alcohol consumption and stopping smoking staying in good shape, exercising regularly and having a healthy, balanced diet Read more about how to improve your chances of becoming a dad. IVF In vitro fertilisation (IVF) may be an option if you have a slightly low sperm count and you've been trying to conceive naturally with your partner for at least two years. During IVF, an egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to grow and develop. Read more about IVF. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a type of IVF technique, in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg to fertilise it. The fertilised egg is then transferred to the woman's womb. ICSI may be offered if you've been trying to conceive naturally with your partner for at least two years and you have either: few or no sperm in your semen poor quality sperm Before having ICSI, you and your partner will need to have an assessment to ensure the treatment is appropriate. This will involve questions about your medical and sexual history, and screening tests to check for infections or genetic problems that could affect your baby and the chances of ICSI working. The Human Fertilisation & Embryo Authority (HFEA) has more information about ICSI. Donor insemination Donor insemination means using sperm donated by another man. You may wish to consider using donor insemination as an alternative to ICSI, particularly if the man has a genetic disorder that could be passed on to any children. It can be used as part of IVF if necessary. If you're considering donor insemination, you should be offered counselling as a couple about the implications for you and your children. Read more about what you need to know about using a sperm donor. Gonadotrophin medication If you have very low levels of gonadotrophin hormones (which stimulate the production of sperm), you should be offered treatment with gonadotrophin medication to improve your fertility. But if no cause has been found for your abnormal sperm count, you will not be offered hormone-based medicines as they are not known to improve fertility in these cases.

But occasionally they can become infected, cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or spread serious illnesses such as Lyme disease and malaria. Bugs that bite or sting include wasps, hornets, bees, horseflies, ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, spiders and midges. This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you've been bitten or stung When to get medical advice When to get emergency medical help Prevention Symptoms of insect bites and stings Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Some people have a mild allergic reaction and a larger area of skin around the bite or sting becomes swollen, red and painful. This should pass within a week. Occasionally, a severe allergic reaction can occur, causing symptoms such as breathing difficulties, dizziness and a swollen face or mouth. This requires immediate medical treatment (see below). Read more about the symptoms of common insect bites and stings. What to do if you've been bitten or stung To treat an insect bite or sting: Remove the sting or tick if it's still in the skin (see treating insect bites and stings for advice about how to do this safely). Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they're unlikely to help. The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. Ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments that can help, such as painkillers, creams for itching and antihistamines. Read more about treatments for insect bites and stings. When to get medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if: you're worried about a bite or sting your symptoms don't start to improve within a few days or are getting worse you've been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes a large area (around 10cm or more) around the bite becomes red and swollen you have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness you have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a fever, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms When to get emergency medical help Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe reaction, such as: wheezing or difficulty breathing a swollen face, mouth or throat nausea or vomiting a fast heart rate dizziness or feeling faint difficulty swallowing loss of consciousness Emergency treatment in hospital is needed in these cases. Prevent insect bites and stings There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin \u2013 repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants \u2013 these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. You may need to take extra precautions if you're travelling to part of the world where there's a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about how to prevent insect bites and stings.

During the first month of life, an embryo (developing baby) grows a structure called the neural tube that will eventually form the spine and nervous system. When something goes wrong with this process, the result is called a \"neural tube defect\". Spina bifida is one type of neural tube defect. The spine consists of the spinal column, which is a solid structure made up of bones (called vertebral bodies) separated by discs of fibrous tissue.  Behind this is an enclosed space called the spinal canal, which contains the spinal cord. The spinal cord connects all the nerves in the body to the brain. The canal is surrounded by arches of bone attached to the backs of the vertebral bodies. In cases of spina bifida, something goes wrong and the arches of bone do not fully close. Sometimes there is only a gap in the bony arch, but at other times the spinal cord is also involved and does not form properly either. The skin over the arch can also either be intact or have a gap as well. The exact cause is unknown, but several things can increase your risk of having a baby with the condition, the most significant being a lack of folic acid before and in the early stages of pregnancy. Read more about the causes of spina bifida and preventing spina bifida. Types of spina bifida There are several different types of spina bifida. Myelomeningocele Myelomeningocele is one of the most serious types of spina bifida. The opening in the spinal arches allows the spinal cord and the protective membranes surrounding it (the meninges) to push out and create a sac in the baby\u2019s back. It can be associated with significant damage to the spinal cord and can leave the nervous system vulnerable to life-threatening infections. Meningocele In meningocele, only the meninges push out of the opening in the spine. This can usually be corrected with surgery and often no further treatment is required. The spinal cord and nervous system are not normally damaged, although some people with the condition may have symptoms such as bladder and bowel problems. Spina bifida occulta Spina bifida occulta is the most common and mildest type of spina bifida. The opening in the spine is very small and covered with skin. This means that the spinal cord and meninges can't push out and there is no obvious bulge in the back. It doesn't usually cause any symptoms and most people are unaware they have it, although some people may have bladder and bowel problems, or weakness and reduced sensation in their legs. These pages focus on myelomeningocele and this is the type referred to whenever the term spina bifida is used. You can read more about the other types of spina bifida on the Shine website. What problems does it cause? In most cases of myelomeningocele, surgery can be carried out to close the opening in the spine. However, damage to the nervous system will usually already have taken place. The damage to the spinal cord can lead to problems such as: weakness or total paralysis of the legs bowel incontinence and urinary incontinence loss of skin sensation in the legs and around the bottom Many babies will have or will develop hydrocephalus (excess fluid on the brain), which can further damage the brain. Most people with spina bifida will have a normal intelligence, but learning difficulties are common, especially with hydrocephalus. Read more about the symptoms of spina bifida and the complications of spina bifida. How spina bifida is treated A number of different treatments can be used to treat symptoms or conditions associated with spina bifida. These include: surgery soon after birth to close the opening in the spine and treat hydrocephalus therapies to help make day-to-day life easier and improve independence, such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy assistive devices and mobility aids, such as a manual or electric wheelchair, or walking aids treatments for bowel and urinary problems, such as medication, draining urine from the bladder with a tube (catheter), anal irrigation systems and surgery With appropriate treatment and support, it's likely that children with spina bifida will survive well into adulthood. It can be a challenging condition to live with, but many adults with spina bifida are able to lead independent and fulfilling lives. Read more about diagnosing spina bifida and treating spina bifida.

SMA is caused by deterioration in the nerve cells (motor neurones) connecting the brain and spinal cord to the body's muscles. As the link between the nerves and muscles breaks down, the muscles used for activities such as crawling, walking, sitting up and moving the head become progressively weaker and shrink (atrophy). Mental abilities are unaffected by SMA. The term spinal muscular atrophy can be applied to a number of different related conditions. Classification of spinal muscular atrophy SMA is classified according to the age symptoms appear and how much physical mobility a person has: Type I \u2013 the most severe type. Symptoms appear in babies less than six months old, and they never develop the ability to sit unsupported. Type II \u2013 less severe than type I. Symptoms usually appear in babies aged 7 to 18 months. Children with Type II can sit unsupported and some are able to stand, but they can't walk independently. Type III \u2013 the mildest type affecting children. Symptoms usually appear after 18 months of age, and children are usually able to reach all the major motor milestones, including independent walking. Type IV \u2013 affects adults. In the most severe cases (Type I), severe respiratory problems mean children rarely survive beyond two years of age. Type II SMA may shorten life expectancy, but improvements in care standards mean the majority of people can live long, fulfilling and productive lives. Survival into adulthood is now expected. Life expectancy is usually unaffected in Types III and IV. Read more about the symptoms of the different types of spinal muscular atrophy. Management and support It's not currently possible to treat the underlying genetic fault that causes SMA, although a number of experimental therapies are currently being evaluated in early clinical trials. However, treatment and support is available to help manage the symptoms and provide people with SMA with the best possible quality of life. Depending on its severity, treatment may involve: exercises and equipment to improve mobility and breathing feeding tubes and nutrition advice bracing or surgery to treat curvature of the spine (scoliosis) A range of healthcare professionals are involved in the care of a person with SMA, including: doctors who specialise in neurology physiotherapists occupational therapists speech and language therapists if appropriate, respiratory physicians and orthopaedic surgeons Read more about treating spinal muscular atrophy. Testing for spinal muscular atrophy If you have a family history of SMA, you should be able to access genetic testing. This involves checking a sample of your blood for the genetic fault responsible for the condition. If there's a chance your baby could have SMA, it's also possible to check for this genetic fault during pregnancy, using tests such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis. Pre-implantation diagnosis (PGD) is also possible. Families should be referred to a geneticist to discuss all these options. If a child shows typical signs of SMA, such as obvious muscle weakness, a blood test can usually confirm a diagnosis. Read more about diagnosing spinal muscular atrophy. Further information and support The most common types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) affect an estimated 2,000 to 2,500 people in the UK. There are several charities for people with the condition, including: Spinal Muscular Atrophy Support UK The SMA Trust Information about you If you or your child has spinal muscular atrophy, your clinical team will pass information about you\/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).

It's carried out using a device called a spirometer, which is a small machine attached by a cable to a mouthpiece. Spirometry may be performed by a nurse or doctor at your GP surgery, or it may be carried out during a short visit to a hospital or clinic. Why spirometry is carried out Spirometry can be used to help diagnose a lung condition if you have symptoms of a problem, or your doctor feels you're at an increased risk of developing a particular lung condition. For example, it may be recommended if you have a persistent cough or breathlessness, or if you're over 35 and smoke. Conditions that can be picked up and monitored using spirometry include: asthma \u2013 a long-term condition in which the airways become periodically inflamed (swollen) and narrowed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \u2013 a group of lung conditions where the airways become narrowed cystic fibrosis \u2013 a genetic condition in which the lungs and digestive system become clogged with thick, sticky mucus pulmonary fibrosis \u2013 scarring of the lungs If you've already been diagnosed with one of these conditions, spirometry may be carried out to check the severity of the condition or see how you're responding to treatment. Spirometry is also a standard test for people who may be being considered for surgery, or to check the general health of people who have other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Preparing for the test You'll be told about anything you need to do to prepare for the test. If you use bronchodilator medication (medicines, usually inhaled, that help relax and widen your airways), you may need to stop using it beforehand. You should also avoid smoking for 24 hours before the test, and avoid drinking alcohol, strenuous exercise or eating large meals for a few hours beforehand. It's best to wear loose, comfortable clothing on the day of the test. What happens during a spirometry test You'll be seated during the test and a soft clip will be placed on your nose to stop air escaping from it. The tester will explain what you need to do and you may be asked to have a few practice attempts first. When you're ready for the test, you'll be asked to: inhale fully, so your lungs are completely filled with air close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece exhale as quickly and forcefully as you can, making sure you empty your lungs fully This will normally need to be repeated at least three times to ensure a reliable result. In some cases, the test may need to be repeated around 15 minutes after taking some inhaled bronchodilator medication. This can show if you have a lung condition that responds to these medications. Overall, your appointment should last around 30-90 minutes. You'll be able to go home soon after the tests have finished and can return to your normal activities. Your results The person carrying out the test won't usually be able to give you your results immediately. The results will need to be looked at by a specialist first, and will be sent to the doctor who referred you for the test, who will discuss them with you a few days later. A spirometer measures the amount of air you can breathe out in one second and the total volume of air you can exhale in one forced breath. These measurements will be compared to a normal result for someone of your age, height and sex, which will help show if your lungs aren't working properly. The measurements will also show whether any problem with your lungs is \"obstructive\", \"restrictive\", or a combination of the two. An obstructive airways disease is where your ability to breathe out quickly is affected by narrowing of the airways, but the amount of air you can hold in your lungs is normal \u2013 such as in asthma or COPD. A restrictive lung disease is where the amount of air you can breathe in is reduced because your lungs are unable to fully expand \u2013 such as in pulmonary fibrosis. Are there any risks or side effects?  Spirometry is a straightforward test and is generally considered very safe. Some people may feel dizzy, faint, shaky, sick or tired for a short period afterwards. Most people are able to have a spirometry test safely. However, the test increases the pressure inside your head, chest, stomach, and eyes as you breathe out, so it may need to be delayed or avoided if you have a condition that could be made worse by this. For example, spirometry may not be safe if you have, or have recently had, unstable angina, a heart attack, uncontrolled high blood pressure, or an operation to your head, chest, stomach or eyes.

The spleen is a fist-sized organ found in the upper left side of your abdomen, next to your stomach and behind your left ribs.  It is an important part of your immune system but you can survive without it. This is because the liver can take over many of the spleen's functions. This page covers: What does the spleen do? Spleen problems: \u2013 spleen pain \u2013 a ruptured spleen \u2013 an enlarged spleen  Splenectomy (having the spleen removed)  Living without a spleen What does the spleen do? The spleen has a few important functions: It fights any invading germs in the blood (the spleen contains infection-fighting white blood cells). It controls the level of blood cells. The spleen controls the level of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets (small cells that form blood clots) It screens the blood and removes any old or damaged red blood cells. If the spleen doesn't work properly, it may start to remove healthy blood cells. This can lead to: anaemia, from a reduced number of red blood cells an increased risk of infection, from a reduced number of white blood cells bleeding or bruising, from a reduced number of platelets Spleen problems Spleen pain Spleen pain is usually felt as a pain behind your left ribs. It may be tender when you touch the area. This can be a sign of a damaged, ruptured or enlarged spleen. A damaged or ruptured spleen The spleen can become damaged or may rupture (burst) after a forceful blow to the abdomen, car accident, sporting accident or fracture to the ribs.  Rupture can happen straight away or it may happen weeks after the injury. Signs of a ruptured spleen are: pain behind your left ribs and tenderness when you touch this area dizziness and a rapid heart rate (a sign of low blood pressure caused by blood loss) Sometimes, if you lie down and raise your legs, the pain can be felt at the tip of your left shoulder. A ruptured spleen is a medical emergency, as it can cause life-threatening bleeding. Go straight to A&E if you think you've ruptured or damaged your spleen. Enlarged spleen The spleen can become swollen after an infection or injury. It can also become enlarged as a result of a disease such as cirrhosis, leukaemia or rheumatoid arthritis. An enlarged spleen doesn't always cause symptoms. Otherwise, look out for: feeling full very quickly after eating (an enlarged spleen can press on the stomach) feeling discomfort or pain behind your left ribs  anaemia and\/or fatigue frequent infections easy bleeding Doctors can often tell if you have an enlarged spleen by feeling your abdomen. A blood test, CT scan or MRI scan would confirm the diagnosis. The spleen is not usually removed if it's just enlarged. Instead, you'll receive treatment for any underlying condition and your spleen will be monitored. Antibiotics may be prescribed if there's an infection. You'll need to avoid contact sports for a while, as you'll be at greater risk of rupturing the spleen while it is enlarged. Surgery is only necessary if the enlarged spleen is causing serious complications or if the cause can't be found. Splenectomy (having the spleen removed) An operation to remove the spleen, known as a splenectomy, may be needed if the spleen is damaged, diseased or enlarged. It may sometimes be more appropriate to have just part of your spleen removed \u2013 a partial splenectomy. If there's time, you'll be advised to have a series of immunisations before the operation. Laparoscopy Most splenectomies are carried out using laparoscopy (keyhole surgery). A laparoscope is long, thin, flexible instrument with its own light source. It is attached to a camera and will relay high definition, magnified pictures back to a TV screen to guide the surgeon's instruments. Laparoscopic splenectomy allows a surgeon to access the inside of your abdomen without having to make large incisions (cuts) in your skin. However, you will still need a general anaesthetic. The procedure involves: Making several incisions in your abdomen (tummy area). Guiding a laparoscope into your body through one of the incisions, so doctors can see what they're doing.  Passing thin instruments into your abdomen through the other incisions, to remove your spleen. Gas will be pumped into your abdomen to make this easier. The incisions will then be stitched up or sometimes glued together. You may be able to go home the same day, or may need to stay in hospital overnight. If you go home the same day, someone will need to stay with you for the first 24 hours. Open surgery Open surgery, where one large incision is made, may be needed if the spleen is too large or too damaged to be removed via keyhole surgery. Often, in emergencies, this will be the preferred method to rapidly control bleeding. You'll need a general anaesthetic and may need to stay in hospital for a few days to recover. Afterwards It's normal to feel sore and be bruised after a splenectomy, but you'll be given pain relief medication. You should be able to eat and drink as normal soon after the operation. Like any operation, a splenectomy carries a small risk of complications, including bleeding and infection. Your doctor will run through these risks with you. You should be given breathing and leg movement exercises to do at home, to reduce your risk of getting a blood clot or a chest infection. Another risk is the surgical wound becoming infected. If you spot any signs of infection, contact your GP or hospital immediately, as you may need antibiotics. Recovery usually takes a few weeks. Your doctor or nurse will advise when you can go back to your usual activities, such as driving. Living without a spleen If your spleen needs to be removed, other organs such as the liver can take over many of the spleen's functions.  This means you will still be able to cope with most infections. However, there is a small risk that a serious infection may develop quickly. This risk will be present for the rest of your life. Risk of infection Young children have a higher risk of serious infection than adults, but the risk is still small. The risk is also increased if you have a medical condition such as sickle cell anaemia, coeliac disease or a condition that affects your immune system, such as HIV. This risk can be minimised by following simple precautions to prevent infection. Vaccinations Make sure you have had all your routine childhood vaccinations. You should also be vaccinated against: pneumococcal infections such as pneumonia, with regular boosters at least every five years flu (get the seasonal flu jab every autumn)  Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)  meningitis C (MenC)  Antibiotics It's recommended that you take low-dose antibiotics for the rest of your life to prevent bacterial infections. Antibiotics are particularly important: for children under the age of 16 for the first two years after your spleen is removed  if your immune system doesn't work properly Be alert for signs of infection Watch out for signs of infection, such as: high temperature (fever) sore throat  cough severe headache  headache with drowsiness or a rash  abdominal pain  redness and swelling around the surgical wound Your GP can prescribe a course of antibiotics for you to use if you get an infection. You should start taking them at the first sign of an infection, so see your GP as soon as possible. If your infection becomes serious, you will be admitted to hospital. Animal and tick bites Bites from animals and ticks (small blood-sucking parasites) can cause infections. If you get bitten by an animal, particularly a dog, start your course of antibiotics and seek medical advice urgently. If you go trekking or camping regularly, you may be at risk of babesiosis, which is a rare disease transmitted by ticks. Try to avoid tick bites by wearing clothes that cover your skin, particularly long trousers. If you become ill, get medical advice straight away. Telling medical staff about your condition Healthcare professionals will mark your health records to show that you don't have a working spleen. However, always remember to tell any medical professionals that you see, including your dentist. Carry medical ID It's a good idea to carry or wear some medical ID. For example: if your spleen is removed, the hospital may give you a splenectomy card to take home with you you may want to buy your own medical ID, such as a MedicAlert or Medi-Tag bracelet or pendant  If you need help or emergency treatment, your medical ID will alert the staff to your condition. Travel abroad If you're travelling abroad: you may be advised to take a course of antibiotics with you find out if you need an extra meningitis vaccination (types ACWY)  check if you need any travel vaccinations  People without a working spleen have an increased risk of developing a severe form of malaria. If possible, avoid countries where malaria is present. If you can't, speak to your GP or local pharmacist about anti-malaria medicine before you travel. You should also use mosquito nets and insect repellent.  Scars The scars from your operation will gradually fade. Learn more about scars.

Spondylolisthesis isn't the same as a slipped disc, which is where one of the spinal discs between the vertebrae ruptures. Symptoms of spondylolisthesis  Many people may not realise they have spondylolisthesis because it doesn't always cause symptoms. Symptoms can include: lower back pain \u2013 which is usually worse during activity and when standing, and is often relieved by lying down pain, numbness or a tingling sensation radiating from your lower back down your legs (sciatica) \u2013 this occurs if the slipped vertebra presses on a nerve tight hamstring muscles stiffness or tenderness in your back excessive curvature of the spine (kyphosis) The severity of these symptoms can vary considerably from person to person. What causes spondylolisthesis? There are five main types of spondylolisthesis, each with a different cause. Spondylolisthesis can be caused by: a birth defect in part of the vertebra \u2013 this can cause it to slip forward (dysplastic spondylolisthesis) repetitive trauma to the spine \u2013 this results in a defect developing in the vertebra, which can cause it to slip; this is known as isthmic spondylolisthesis and is more common in athletes such as gymnasts and weightlifters the joints of the vertebrae becoming worn and arthritic \u2013 this is known as degenerative spondylolisthesis and is more common in older people a sudden injury or trauma to the spine \u2013 such as a fracture, which can result in the vertebra slipping forward (traumatic spondylolisthesis) a bone abnormality \u2013 this could be caused by a tumour, for example (pathologic spondylolisthesis) When to see your GP You should see your GP if: you have persistent back pain or stiffness you have persistent pain in your thighs or buttocks your back curves outwards excessively Your GP may examine your back, although there aren't usually any visible signs of spondylolisthesis. Your GP may ask you to do a straight leg raise test, where you lie on your back while your GP holds your foot and lifts your leg up, keeping your knee straight. This is often painful if you have spondylolisthesis. Spondylolisthesis can easily be confirmed by taking an X-ray of your spine from the side while you're standing. This will show whether a vertebra has slipped out of position or if you have a fracture. If you have pain, numbness, tingling or weakness in your legs, you may need additional imaging tests, such as a computerised tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. These more detailed scans will be able to help determine whether you have a compressed nerve in your back. Treating spondylolisthesis The way spondylolisthesis is treated will depend on your symptoms and how severe they are. In most cases non-surgical treatments will be recommended first. Non-surgical treatments Initial treatments for spondylolisthesis may include: a short period of rest, avoiding activities such as bending, lifting, contact sports and athletics anti-inflammatory painkillers, such as ibuprofen, or stronger painkillers available on prescription can help reduce pain and inflammation physiotherapy \u2013 simple stretching and strengthening exercises may help increase the range of motion in your lower back and hamstrings if you have pain, numbness and tingling in your legs, corticosteroid injections around the compressed nerve and into the spinal canal may be recommended These measures will only provide temporary symptom relief, but your symptoms may disappear completely with time. Back braces sometimes used to be recommended for some people with spondylolisthesis. However, there are concerns that bracing may actually weaken the spine and fail to improve symptoms. Surgery Surgery may be recommended if non-surgical treatments are ineffective and your symptoms are severe, persistent, or suggest you have a compressed nerve in your spine. The exact surgical procedure you need will depend on the type of spondylolisthesis you have. It usually involves fusing the slipped vertebra to the neighbouring vertebrae using metal screws and rods, and a piece of your own bone taken from an area nearby. The screws and rods are usually left in place permanently. In some cases the spinal disc being compressed between your vertebrae may also be removed. It will be replaced by a small \"cage\" containing a bone graft to hold your vertebrae apart. The operation is performed under general anaesthetic, which means you'll be unconscious while it's carried out.  Surgery is often effective at relieving many of the symptoms of spondylolisthesis, particularly pain and numbness in the legs. However, it's a major operation that involves up to a week-long stay in hospital and a recovery period lasting months, where you have to limit your activities. Spinal surgery for spondylolisthesis also carries a risk of potentially serious complications, including: infection at the site of the operation a blood clot developing in one of the veins in your leg \u2013 known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) damage to the spinal nerves or spinal cord, resulting in continuing symptoms, numbness or weakness in the legs, or, in rare cases, some degree of paralysis or loss of bowel or bladder control Because of the possibility of complications, make sure you discuss the operation in detail with your doctor or surgeon before deciding to have surgery.

Sports injuries can be caused by: an accident \u2013 such as a fall or heavy blow not warming up properly before exercising using inappropriate equipment or poor technique pushing yourself too hard Almost any part of the body can be injured, including the muscles, bones, joints and connective tissues (tendons and ligaments). The ankles and knees are some of the most commonly affected areas. Read about typical sports injuries. What to do if you have an injury If you've injured yourself, you will probably notice pain, tenderness, swelling, bruising, and restricted movement or stiffness in the affected area immediately. Sometimes, you may only notice these symptoms several hours after exercising or playing sports. Stop exercising if you feel pain, regardless of whether your injury happened suddenly or you\u2019ve had the pain for a while. Continuing to exercise while you're injured may cause further damage and slow your recovery time. If the injury is minor, you don't usually need to see a doctor and can look after yourself at home (see below), but you may want to visit your GP or local NHS walk-in centre if you need advice or your symptoms don't get better over time. If the injury is severe, such as a broken bone, dislocation or severe head injury, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible. Treating a sports injury You can usually treat minor injuries yourself by: resting the affected body part for the first 48-72 hours to prevent further damage regularly applying an ice pack to the affected area during the first 48-72 hours to reduce swelling using over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to relieve pain If your symptoms are severe or don't start to get better within a few days or weeks, your GP may be able to refer you for specialist treatment and support, such as physiotherapy. Particularly serious injuries will occasionally require a procedure or operation to align any misplaced bones, fix any broken bones, or repair any torn ligaments. Depending on the type of injury you have, it can take a few weeks or months to make a full recovery. While you recover, it's important not to do too much too fast \u2013 aim to increase your level of activity gradually over time. Read more about treating sports injuries. Preventing sports injuries You can reduce your risk of getting injured by: warming up properly before you exercise \u2013 read more about how to warm up before exercise and how to stretch after exercise not pushing your body beyond your current fitness level using appropriate equipment for specific sports \u2013 such as suitable running shoes, shin guards for football, and a gum shield for rugby receiving coaching to learn correct techniques If you start a new sport or activity, get advice and training from a qualified healthcare professional or sports coach.

It often involves the knees, although joints such as the hips, ankles and elbows can also be affected. Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue found throughout the body. It covers the surface of joints, acting as a shock absorber and allowing bones to slide over one another. It can become damaged as a result of a sudden injury, such as a sports injury, or gradual wear and tear (osteoarthritis). Minor cartilage injuries may get better on their own within a few weeks, but more severe cartilage damage may eventually require surgery. This page covers: Symptoms When to get medical advice Treatments Symptoms of cartilage damage Symptoms of cartilage damage in a joint include: joint pain \u2013 this may continue even when resting and worsen when you put weight on the joint swelling \u2013 this may not develop for a few hours or days stiffness a clicking or grinding sensation the joint locking, catching or giving way It can sometimes be difficult to tell a cartilage injury apart from other common joint injuries, such as sprains, as the symptoms are similar. When to get medical advice If you've injured your joint, it's a good idea to try self-care measures first. Sprains and minor cartilage damage may get better on their own within a few days or weeks. More severe cartilage damage probably won't improve on its own and if left untreated, can eventually wear down the joint. Visit your GP or a minor injuries unit (MIU) if: you can't move the joint properly you can't control the pain with ordinary painkillers you can't put any weight on the injured limb or it gives way when you try to use it the injured area looks crooked or has unusual lumps or bumps (other than swelling) you have numbness, discolouration or coldness in any part of the injured area your symptoms haven't started to improve within a few days of self-treatment Your GP may need to refer you for tests such as an X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or arthroscopy (a type of keyhole surgery used to look inside joints) to find out if your cartilage is damaged. Treatments for cartilage damage Self-care measures are usually recommended as the first treatment for minor joint injuries. For the first few days: protect the affected area from further injury by using a support, such as a knee brace rest the affected joint elevate the affected limb and apply an ice pack to the joint regularly take ordinary painkillers, such as paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Get medical advice if your symptoms are severe or don't improve after a few days. You may need professional treatment such as physiotherapy, or possibly surgery. A number of surgical techniques can be used, including: encouraging the growth of new cartilage by drilling small holes in the nearby bone replacing the damaged cartilage with healthy cartilage taken from another part of the joint replacing the entire joint with an artificial one, such as a knee replacement or hip replacement \u2013 this is usually only necessary in the most severe cases Read more about how cartilage damage is treated.

It can also help to reduce your risk of injury or illness in the future. It takes a holistic approach that involves the patient directly in their own care. When is physiotherapy used? Physiotherapy can be helpful for people of all ages with a wide range of health conditions, including problems affecting the: bones, joints and soft tissue \u2013 such as back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain and sports injuries brain or nervous system \u2013 such as movement problems resulting from a stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS) or Parkinson's disease heart and circulation \u2013 such as rehabilitation after a heart attack lungs and breathing \u2013 such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis Physiotherapy can improve your physical activity while helping you to prevent further injuries. Physiotherapists Physiotherapy is provided by specially-trained and regulated practitioners called physiotherapists. Physiotherapists often work as part of a multi-disciplinary team in various areas of medicine and settings, including: hospitals community health centres or clinics some GP surgeries some sports teams, clubs, charities and workplaces Some physiotherapists can also offer home visits. What physiotherapists do Physiotherapists consider the body as a whole, rather than just focusing on the individual aspects of an injury or illness. Some of the main approaches used by physiotherapists include: education and advice \u2013 physiotherapists can give general advice about things that can affect your daily lives, such as posture and correct lifting or carrying techniques to help prevent injuries movement, tailored exercise and physical activity advice \u2013 exercises may be recommended to improve your general health and mobility, and to strengthen specific parts of your body manual therapy \u2013 where the physiotherapist uses their hands to help relieve pain and stiffness, and to encourage better movement of the body There are other techniques that may sometimes be used, such as exercises carried out in water (hydrotherapy or aquatic therapy) or acupuncture. Read more about the main physiotherapy techniques. Finding a physiotherapist Physiotherapy is available through the NHS or privately. You may need a referral from your GP to have physiotherapy on the NHS, although in some areas it's possible to refer yourself directly. To find out whether self-referral is available in your area, ask the reception staff at your GP surgery or contact your local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) or trust. Waiting lists for NHS treatment can be long and some people choose to pay for private treatment. Most private physiotherapists accept direct self-referrals.

The shin pain can be felt during or after strenuous activity, particularly running, or sports with sudden stops and starts, such as basketball and tennis. The pain is felt along the shin bone (tibia), which runs down the inner part of your shin. At first you will feel a dull, aching pain. If you ignore it and continue to exercise, it can become very painful and you may have to stop exercising altogether. It's really important not to \"run through the pain\" because shin pain could be a sign of an injury to the bone and surrounding tissues in your leg. Continued force on your legs will make the injury and your pain worse. If possible, stop doing the activity which causes the problem for at least two weeks. You can still exercise during this time, but choose activities that don't put too much force on your shins, such as cycling, swimming, cross-training or yoga. Why shin splints happen Shin splints have a number of different causes. You're at risk of getting shin splints if you: have been running for less than five years run on hard surfaces or slopes wear poorly fitting or worn-out trainers that don't cushion and support your feet properly are overweight, as this places extra stress on your legs have flat feet or your feet roll inwards, as this puts more pressure on your lower legs have weak ankles or a tight Achilles tendon (the band of tissue connecting the heel bone to the calf muscle) have tight calf muscles Medial stress syndrome The most common cause of shin splints is medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS). MTSS is the result of frequent and intense periods of exercise when your body isn't used to it. Long-distance running and sports involving a lot of stopping and starting, such as basketball and tennis, increase your risk of getting MTSS. Suddenly increasing the distance and\/or pace you run are also common causes. These activities place a considerable amount of pressure on your legs, particularly if they are carried out on hard ground, and can cause injury to the bone and surrounding tissues. MTSS is thought to occur when the layer of connective tissue covering the surface of the shin bone (periosteum) becomes inflamed. It can become inflamed if too much pressure is placed on your shins, or if your foot rolls excessively when it hits the ground. This is known as over-pronation and it puts abnormal forces through the tibia and the shin bone. The pain is usually felt in both shins and it can take several days, or even weeks, for the pain to decrease once you stop the activity. Self care You should stop the activity causing your shin splints for at least two weeks. After this time, the pain in your shins should begin to decrease and you can gradually resume the activity (see below). While you're resting your legs, you can continue to do low impact activities, such as cross-training, cycling or swimming. Pool running is also a good way of maintaining cardiovascular fitness. Pain relief Pain and swelling can be relieved by holding an ice pack against your shins (a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel works well). Do this for 10 minutes every two to three hours for the first two days. You can also use over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, to help relieve the pain and inflammation. Stretching your calf muscles and the front of your leg can also help. Choosing the right shoes It's important your running shoes give you the right amount of cushioning and support for your weight and foot type. If your foot rolls inwards, you may need to have orthotics (rigid shoe inserts) fitted. Go to a specialist running shop if you are buying running shoes for the first time. A trained member of staff will be able to carry out a number of tests, including a gait analysis, and advise which shoes are best for you. If you continue having problems with your shoes, a podiatrist can give a more expert opinion and look at your overall lower limb biomechanics. Podiatrists specialise in diagnosing and treating foot problems. Find a podiatrist in your area. When to visit your GP See your GP if the pain does not improve. They will investigate other possible causes, such as: reduced blood supply to the lower leg, particularly if you smoke  tiny cracks in the shin bone (stress fractures), which usually, but not always, give pain in only one leg a leg muscle bulging out of place (muscle hernia) swelling of the leg muscle that compresses nearby nerves and blood vessels, known as compartment syndrome (see below)  a nerve problem in your lower back (radiculopathy) The pain of compartment syndrome is usually felt in both legs and only comes on with exercise. It can be felt in the front, side or back of the leg and, sometimes, in all three. Unlike the pain of MTSS, the pain caused by compartment syndrome quickly subsides when exercise ceases. Seek immediate medical assistance if: the pain is severe and follows a fall or accident your shins are hot and inflamed the swelling gets worse the pain persists during rest Your GP may refer you for physiotherapy, or you may be able to refer yourself. You could also opt to see a physiotherapist privately. Read more about accessing physiotherapy. The physiotherapist can assess your injury, show you some exercises and advise a suitable programme of rehabilitation. Alternatively, your GP may refer you to a consultant orthopaedic surgeon with a foot and ankle interest, or a consultant in sport and exercise medicine. These doctors are trained in assessing and treating sport-related problems. Getting back to your normal exercise programme You can return to your usual activity after at least two weeks of rest, and only after the pain has gone. Increase your activity level gradually, building up the time you spend running or doing sports. Run on a flat, soft surface, such as a recreation ground or playing field. Keep the distance and intensity of your run to 50% of what it was before the injury. Stop immediately if the pain returns. Gradually, over a period of three to six weeks, you can increase the distance you run. After six weeks, you can gradually start to increase your pace. Make sure you warm up properly before starting to exercise and, afterwards, take time to cool down. Learn how to warm up before exercising and how to stretch after exercising. Preventing shin splints returning You can avoid shin splints in the future by: wearing running shoes with the correct level of cushioning and support using orthotics (supportive insoles) if you over-pronate or have flat feet (running shop staff or a podiatrist will be able to advise you further about this) avoid training on hard surfaces whenever possible build up your activity level gradually improving your overall strength and flexibility Page last reviewed: 16\/12\/2014 Next review due: 16\/12\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

They often occur when playing sports if you change direction or speed suddenly, fall and land awkwardly, or collide with an object or person. Read more about the causes of sprains and strains. Sprains A sprain occurs when one or more ligaments have been stretched, twisted or torn, usually as a result of excessive force being applied to a joint. Ligaments are strong bands of tissue around joints that connect bones to one another. Common locations for sprains include the knees, ankles, wrists and thumbs. Symptoms of a sprain can include: pain around the affected joint inability to use the joint normally or put weight on it swelling, bruising and tenderness There may be swelling soon after the injury but the bruising may not show until later or it may not show at all. Bruising sometimes develops away from the affected joint, as blood seeps along the muscles before surfacing to the skin. Strains A strain occurs when muscle fibres stretch or tear. It's usually the result of the muscle being stretched beyond its limits or forced to contract (shorten) too quickly. Muscle strains are particularly common in the legs and back, such as hamstring strains and lumbar (lower back) strains. Symptoms of a muscle strain can include: swelling, bruising or redness  pain in the affected muscle at rest pain in the muscle or associated joint during use muscle spasms (when the muscles contract tightly and painfully) weakness and loss of some, or all, of the function in the affected muscle When to seek medical help Most sprains and strains are relatively minor and can be treated at home (see below). However, you should visit a minor injuries unit (MIU) or your GP if you think you have a sprain or strain and: the pain is particularly severe you can't move the injured joint or muscle you can't put any weight on the injured limb or it gives way when you try to use it the injured area looks crooked or has unusual lumps or bumps (other than swelling) you have numbness, discolouration or coldness in any part of the injured area the symptoms haven't started to improve within a few days of self-treatment If you have any of these symptoms your injury will need to be assessed by a doctor. You might have a severe sprain or strain or another serious injury, such as a fracture. Read more about diagnosing sprains and strains. How sprains and strains are treated Minor sprains and strains can usually be treated with self care techniques, such as PRICE therapy (protection, rest, ice, compression and elevation). Generally, you should try to start moving a sprained joint as soon as it's not too painful to do so, whereas a strained muscle should normally be immobilised for at least a few days. Ordinary painkillers, such as paracetamol, can be used to help ease any pain, although stronger medication can be prescribed if the pain is more severe. Most people will regain full use of the affected body part within six to eight weeks, although severe injuries may take longer to heal and some people may experience persistent problems lasting several months or longer. Read more about treating sprains and strains. Preventing sprains and strains To help prevent sprains and strains you should: wear the correct footwear for the activity you're doing  warm up properly before exercise stretch or \"warm down\" after exercise do regular strengthening and flexibility exercises Read more about preventing sprains and strains. Driving after an injury If you've sprained your ankle, avoid driving until strength and mobility have returned. The length of time you're unable to drive for will depend on the severity of the sprain and how quickly it recovers. Your GP or physiotherapist can give you more advice.

They help move the bones and joints when muscles contract.  The main types of tendon injury are: tendonitis \u2013 inflammation of a tendon tendinopathy \u2013 the gradual deterioration of a tendon tenosynovitis \u2013 inflammation of the protective sheath that surrounds a tendon tendon rupture \u2013 a sudden tear in a tendon Tendon injuries usually happen during sports or activities that involve sudden, sharp movements, such as throwing or jumping, or after repeated overuse of the tendons, such as running. They can also be caused by repetitive daily activities, such as regularly using a computer keyboard and mouse. This is known as a repetitive strain injury (RSI). Symptoms of a tendon injury Tendon injuries can affect many different parts of the body. Commonly affected areas include the shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees, fingers and backs of the heels. Symptoms of a tendon injury can include: pain that gets worse when you move the affected area stiffness in the affected area, which may be worse in the morning weakness in the affected area or being unable to move a joint a sensation that the tendon is grating or crackling as it moves swelling, sometimes with heat or redness a lump on the affected tendon If your tendon ruptures, you will usually experience sudden and severe pain, which may eventually settle into a continuous, dull ache or no pain at all. Movement in the affected area may also become more difficult or even impossible. Read more about the symptoms of tendon injuries. When to see your GP Minor tendon injuries can often be treated at home (see below). They will usually get better in a few weeks. See your GP if your symptoms are severe or don't start to improve within a few weeks, or if you think you may have ruptured a tendon. Your GP will usually be able to diagnose a tendon injury by asking about your symptoms and examining the affected area. Occasionally, they may request an X-ray, ultrasound scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to confirm the diagnosis. Some medications may be related to tendon injuries, such as fluoroquinolone antibiotics and statins, so your GP may stop these if you\u2019re taking them. Treating tendon injuries If you think you have injured a tendon, stop doing the exercise or activity that caused your symptoms and rest the affected area initially. As your symptoms start to improve, you can gradually return to your normal activities. In the meantime, taking paracetamol or ibuprofen and applying an ice pack or bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel to the affected area may help relieve your pain. For more persistent injuries, your GP may be able to refer you for treatments such as physiotherapy, corticosteroid injections or shock wave therapy. In some cases, surgery may be recommended to treat long-term injuries that have not improved following other treatments, or to repair a ruptured tendon. Read more about treating tendon injuries. Preventing tendon injuries You can help reduce your risk of tendon injuries by: warming up before playing sport or exercising, and cooling down afterwards \u2013 read about how to warm up before exercising and how to stretch after exercising making sure you use the correct equipment for the activity you're doing, such as wearing appropriate footwear getting specialist coaching or training to help improve your technique in a particular sport not exerting yourself beyond your physical capability exercising the affected area to stretch and strengthen it \u2013 a physiotherapist may be able to advise you about the best exercises to do avoiding repetitive movements when possible and make sure you take regular breaks ensuring your desk, keyboard and mouse are in a comfortable position \u2013 read more about preventing RSI If your job involves repetitive movements, ask your employer to provide rest periods, devices to support your wrists, and help with your posture.

Non-melanoma skin cancer refers to a group of cancers that slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin. The term 'non-melanoma' distinguishes these more common kinds of skin cancer from the less common skin cancer known as melanoma, which spreads faster in the body. The first sign of non-melanoma skin cancer is usually the appearance of a lump or patch on the skin that doesn't heal after a few weeks. In most cases, cancerous lumps are red and firm, while cancerous patches are often flat and scaly. See your GP if you have any skin abnormality that hasn't healed after four weeks. Although it is unlikely to be skin cancer, it is best to be sure. Read more about the symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer. Types of non-melanoma skin cancer Non-melanoma skin cancers usually develop in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis) and are often named after the type of skin cell from which they develop. The two most common types of non-melanoma skin cancer are: basal cell carcinoma \u2013 starts in the cells lining the bottom of the epidermis and accounts for about 75% of skin cancers squamous cell carcinoma \u2013 starts in the cells lining the top of the epidermis and accounts for about 20% of skin cancers Although not classed as non-melanoma skin cancers, actinic keratoses and Bowen's disease may sometimes develop into squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated. Why does it happen? Non-melanoma skin cancer is mainly caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light comes from the sun, as well as artificial sunbeds and sunlamps. In addition to UV light overexposure, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing non-melanoma skin cancer, such as: a family history of the condition pale skin that burns easily a large number of moles or freckles Read more about the causes of non-melanoma skin cancer. Who is affected? Non-melanoma skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. There are more than 100,000 new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer every year in the UK. Non-melanoma skin cancer affects slightly more men than women. Diagnosis Your GP can examine your skin for signs of skin cancer. They may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or a specialist plastic surgeon if they are unsure or suspect skin cancer. Your GP may refer you urgently, within two weeks, for squamous cell skin cancer. Basal cell skin cancers usually don't need an urgent referral but you should still see a specialist within 18 weeks. Read a guide to NHS waiting times. The specialist will examine your skin again and will perform a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of skin cancer. A biopsy is an operation that removes some affected skin so it can be studied under a microscope. Read more about diagnosing non-melanoma skin cancer. Treating non-melanoma skin cancer Surgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer. This involves removing the cancerous tumour and some of the surrounding skin. Other treatments for non-melanoma skin cancer include cryotherapy, creams, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and a treatment known as photodynamic therapy (PDT). Treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer is generally successful as, unlike most other types of cancer, there is a considerably lower risk that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body. It is estimated that basal cell carcinoma will spread to other parts of the body in less than 0.5% of cases. The risk is slightly higher in cases of squamous cell carcinoma, which spreads to other parts of the body in around 2-5% of cases. Treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer is completely successful in approximately 90% of cases. Read more about treating non-melanoma skin cancer. Complications If you have had non-melanoma skin cancer in the past, there is a chance the condition may return. The chance of non-melanoma skin cancer returning is increased if your previous cancer was widespread and severe. If your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your non-melanoma skin cancer returning, you will probably require regular check-ups to monitor your health. You will also be shown how to examine your skin to check for tumours. Prevention Non-melanoma skin cancer is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing the condition by avoiding overexposure to UV light. You can help protect yourself from sunburn by using sunscreen, dressing sensibly in the sun and limiting the time you spend in the sun during the hottest part of the day. Sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided. Regularly checking your skin for signs of skin cancer can help lead to an early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment.

The main sign is a red, scaly patch on the skin. It affects the squamous cells \u2013 in the outermost layer of skin \u2013 and is sometimes referred to as \"squamous cell carcinoma in situ\". The patch is usually very slow-growing, but if left untreated there's a small chance it could turn into a more serious type of skin cancer. This page covers: Is it serious? Symptoms When to get medical advice Causes Treatments Looking after your skin Is Bowen's disease serious? Bowen's disease itself isn't usually serious. It tends to grow very slowly over months or years and there are several very effective treatments for it (see below). The concern is that Bowen's disease can eventually develop into a different type of skin cancer called squamous cell skin cancer if it's left undiagnosed or neglected. It's estimated that this happens in up to 1 in 20 to 1 in 30 people with untreated Bowen's disease. Squamous cell skin cancer is often treatable, but it can spread deeper into the body and is sometimes very serious. Symptoms of Bowen's disease Bowen's disease usually appears as a patch on the skin that has clear edges and doesn't heal. Some people have more than one patch. The patch may be: red or pink scaly or crusty flat or raised up to a few centimetres across itchy (but isn't always) The patch can appear anywhere on the skin, but is especially common on exposed areas such as the lower legs, neck and head. Sometimes they can affect the groin area and, in men, the penis. If the patch bleeds, starts to turn into an open sore (ulcer), or develops a lump, it could be a sign that it has turned into squamous cell skin cancer. When to get medical advice See your GP if you have a persistent red, scaly patch of skin and don't know the cause. It's important to get a proper diagnosis, as Bowen's disease can look like other conditions, such as psoriasis or eczema. If necessary, your GP will refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) to determine what the problem is. If they're not sure about the cause, they may need to remove a small sample of skin so it can be looked at more closely (called a biopsy). Causes of Bowen's disease Bowen's disease usually affects older people in their 60s and 70s. The exact cause is unclear, but it has been closely linked with: long-term exposure to the sun or use of sunbeds \u2013 especially in people with fair skin having a weak immune system \u2013 for example, it's more common in people taking medication to suppress their immune system after an organ transplant or those with AIDS previous radiotherapy treatment the human papillomavirus (HPV) \u2013 a common virus that often affects the genital area and can cause genital warts Bowen's disease doesn't run in families and you can't pass it on to others. Treatments for Bowen's disease There are a number of treatment options for Bowen's disease. Talk to your dermatologist about which treatment is most suitable for you. The main treatments are: Cryotherapy \u2013 Liquid nitrogen is sprayed onto the affected skin to freeze it. The procedure may be painful and the skin may remain a bit uncomfortable for a few days. The affected skin will scab over and fall off within a few weeks. Imiquimod cream or chemotherapy cream (such as 5-fluorouracil) \u2013 This is applied to the affected skin regularly for a few weeks. It may cause your skin to become red and inflamed before it gets better. Curettage and cautery \u2013 The affected area of skin is scraped away under local anaesthetic (the skin is numbed), and heat or electricity is used to stop any bleeding, leaving the area to scab over and heal after a few weeks. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) \u2013 A light-sensitive cream is applied to the affected skin, and a laser is directed onto the skin a few hours later, to destroy the abnormal cells. The treatment session lasts about 20-45 minutes. You may need more than one session. Surgery \u2013 The abnormal skin is cut out under local anaesthetic and stitches may be needed afterwards. In a few cases, your dermatologist may just advise monitoring your skin closely \u2013 for example, if it's very slow-growing and they feel the side effects of treatment will outweigh the benefits. Looking after your skin after treatment After treatment, you may need follow-up appointments with your dermatologist or GP to see if you need any further treatment. If you had surgery, you may need to have any stitches removed at your GP surgery a week or two later. After treatment: see your GP if an existing patch starts to bleed, change in appearance or develops a lump \u2013 don't wait for your follow-up appointment see your GP if you notice any worrying new patches on your skin make sure you protect your skin from the sun \u2013 wear protective clothing and use a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 Read more advice on staying safe in the sun.

They usually develop before five years of age, but can appear later. Signs and symptoms of a squint One of your child's eyes may turn inwards, outwards, upwards or downwards, while the other eye looks forward. Squints may not be constant, and a minor squint isn't always obvious. A squint can cause blurred or double vision, but children may not realise there's a problem. Left untreated, lazy eye (amblyopia) can develop. This is when the brain starts to ignore signals coming from the eye with the squint. When to see a doctor It's quite normal for the eyes of newborn babies to \"cross\" occasionally, particularly when they're tired. However, speak to your GP if you notice this happening to your child after three months of age. If your child looks at you with one eye closed or with their head turned to one side, it may mean they're experiencing double vision and could be a sign they have a squint. If this happens repeatedly, take your child to see your GP as soon as possible. They may refer you to a specialist called an orthoptist, for tests. Many squints are detected during routine eye checks carried out at certain stages in your child's development. Read more about diagnosing squints. Why do squints happen? The exact cause of a squint isn't always known. Some babies are born with a squint (congenital squint) and some develop it later (acquired squint). Acquired squints are often caused by the eye attempting to overcome a vision problem \u2013 known as refractive errors. Types of refractive errors include: short-sightedness (myopia) \u2013 the ability to see distant objects is reduced long-sightedness (hyperopia) \u2013 the ability to see close-up objects is reduced astigmatism \u2013 where the cornea at the front of the eye is unevenly curved, which causes blurred vision In rare cases, a squint may be the result of: childhood illnesses \u2013 such as measles some genetic conditions \u2013 such as Down's syndrome or cerebral palsy hydrocephalus \u2013 caused by a build-up of fluid in the brain other eye problems affecting the muscles or the retina (the layer of light-sensitive nerve cells at the back of the eye) A child's risk of having a squint is increased if there's a family history of eye problems, if they're born prematurely or with a low birth weight. How are squints treated? To be most successful and avoid long-term problems, most squints should be treated as soon as possible. Treatment is most effective in very young children. Several types of treatment are available for squints, including: Glasses \u2013 worn constantly to correct vision problems (refractive errors). Children are usually given plastic lenses instead of glass. Eye exercises \u2013 in some cases, special eye exercises may help the eyes to work together. Botulinum toxin injections into one of the eye muscles \u2013 the injection weakens the muscle, allowing the eyes to realign for around three months. The eyes may stay in position or may need further treatment. Children will usually be given a sedative before the injection. Botulinum toxin injections can cause temporary side effects, such as: a droopy eyelid (ptosis) the eye \"drifting\" slightly, so it appears as if one eye is looking up double vision some bleeding over the white part of the eye If your child has a lazy eye, they may need to wear a patch over their \"good\" eye to encourage the eye with the squint to work harder (occlusion). Squint surgery If other treatments aren't successful, surgery will probably be required. This involves moving the muscles that control the movement of the eye to improve their alignment and help the eyes work together. Risks from surgery are rare, although sometimes more than one operation will be needed. Recovering from surgery It can take several weeks to fully recover from corrective squint surgery. The eye may feel painful or itchy for a short time afterwards, and you may have temporary double vision. Read more about squint surgery. Occasionally, squints corrected during childhood reappear in adulthood. You should visit your GP as soon as possible if you develop a new squint.

They're mainly prescribed to treat depression, particularly persistent or severe cases, and are often used in combination with a talking therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). SSRIs are usually the first choice medication for depression because they generally have fewer side effects than most other types of antidepressant. As well as depression, SSRIs can be used to treat a number of other mental health conditions, including: generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) panic disorder severe phobias, such as agoraphobia and social phobia bulimia post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) SSRIs can sometimes be used to treat other conditions, such as premature ejaculation, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Occasionally, they may also be prescribed to treat pain. How SSRIs work It's thought that SSRIs work by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter (a messenger chemical that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain). It's thought to have a good influence on mood, emotion and sleep. After carrying a message, serotonin is usually reabsorbed by the nerve cells (known as \"reuptake\"). SSRIs work by blocking (\"inhibiting\") reuptake, meaning more serotonin is available to pass further messages between nearby nerve cells. It would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, but a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms and make people more responsive to other types of treatment, such as CBT. Doses and duration of treatment SSRIs are usually taken in tablet form. When they're prescribed, you'll start on the lowest possible dose thought necessary to improve your symptoms. SSRIs usually need to be taken for two to four weeks before the benefit is felt. You may experience mild side effects early on, but it's important that you don't stop taking the medication. These effects will usually wear off quickly. If you take an SSRI for four to six weeks without feeling any benefit, speak to your GP or mental health specialist. They may recommend increasing your dose or trying an alternative antidepressant. A course of treatment usually lasts for at least six months, although longer courses are sometimes recommended and some people with recurrent problems may be advised to take them indefinitely. Read more about SSRI doses. Things to consider SSRIs aren't suitable for everyone. They're not usually recommended if you're pregnant, breastfeeding or under 18, because there's an increased risk of serious side effects. However, exceptions can be made if the benefits of treatment are thought to outweigh the risks. SSRIs also need to be used with caution if you have certain underlying health problems, including diabetes, epilepsy and kidney disease. Some SSRIs can react unpredictably with other medicines, including some over-the-counter painkillers and herbal remedies, such as St John\u2019s wort. Always read the information leaflet that comes with your SSRI medication to check if there are any medicines you need to avoid. Read more about the cautions and interactions of SSRIs.

Stammering is characterised by: the repetition of sounds or syllables \u2013 such as saying \u2018mu-mu-mu-mummy\u2019 prolonging sounds \u2013 for example 'mmmmmmummy' pausing or 'blocking' \u2013 when a word gets stuck or doesn't come out at all It usually occurs at the beginning of speech, and people will often avoid certain words or speaking situations to try to hide it. Stammering varies in severity from person to person. A person might find that they have periods of stammering followed by times when they speak relatively fluently. Read more about the signs of stammering. Types of stammering There are two main types of stammer: Developmental stammering is the most common type of stammering that many people are familiar with. It develops during childhood as a child is first learning how to speak. Acquired or late-onset stammering can occur in older children and adults as the result of a severe head injury, stroke or a progressive neurological disease (disease affecting the nervous system). It can also be caused by certain drugs or medication, or psychological or emotional trauma. The rest of this article will focus on developmental stammering. What causes stammering? The exact cause of developmental stammering is still unclear, although it is largely thought to be the result of the parts of the brain involved in speech being 'wired' differently. Studies have shown differences in the structure and functioning of the brain of people who stammer compared with most other people. In young children, the wiring of the brain is still developing, which may be why many children eventually 'grow out' of stammering and why it is usually easier to treat children while they are still young. Genes are also thought to play a role in many cases of stammering, as around two in every three people who stammer have a family history of the condition. This suggests that the genes a child inherits from their parents might make them more likely to develop a stammer. Research has identified several genes that may contribute to stammering that runs in families, although exactly how these genes lead to the condition is currently unknown. Who is affected Stammering is common in young children. Estimates for developmental stammering vary, but it is often suggested that around one in 20 children will experience a phase of non-fluent speech. In around three in every four cases affecting young children, stammering will resolve over time with or without treatment. However, it is difficult to predict when this will happen and some children will require treatment to prevent the problem persisting into adulthood. The condition is more likely to persist in males than females, which is why there are around four times as many men as women with a stammer. The reason for this is unclear. It is estimated that one in every 100 adults has a stammer. Getting help If you have any concerns about your child's speech and language development, seek advice. Treatment is often highly successful in resolving stammers in pre-school age children, especially if it is received as soon as possible, so early referral to a specialist is key. A good person to contact first may be your GP, who can discuss your concerns with you and refer you to a speech and language therapist (SLT) for an assessment if necessary. Alternatively, many speech and language services accept self-referrals from patients and parents. You can contact the British Stammering Association helpline on 0845 603 2001 for advice about seeking help and information about the services available in your area. It may also be worth seeking advice from your GP or an SLT if you are an adult with a stammer and it is having a significant impact on your social and work life. How stammering is treated There are many different speech and language therapy approaches that can help people to improve fluency and communication skills in people who stammer. A therapist will work with you to come up with a suitable plan tailored to your or your child's individual circumstances. This may involve: working to create an environment in which a child feels more relaxed and confident about their use of language working on feelings associated with stammering, such as fear and anxiety strategies to improve fluency and communication skills Electronic \u2018anti-stammering\u2019 devices are also available and can be helpful for some people. These are designed to help people control their speech by giving them sound feedback, although they are not generally available on the NHS. Read more about treating stammering.

You may have heard them referred to as \"staph infections\". Staph bacteria can cause a wide range of infections, from relatively minor skin infections such as boils, to more serious infections of the blood, lungs and heart. There are many types of Staphylococci, but most infections are caused by a group called Staphylococcus aureus. This group of bacteria includes meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is resistant to certain antibiotics that are commonly used for staph infections, such as flucloxacillin. It also includes PVL-Staphylococcus aureus, which produces a toxin called Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), which kills infection-fighting white blood cells and can cause recurrent skin infections, such as boils and abscesses. This page covers some of the main types of staph infection, including information on how these infections are spread and treated. Types of staph infections Staph infections can be broadly classified into two groups: skin and soft tissue infections, and invasive infections. Examples are given below. Skin and soft tissue infections Most infections caused by staph bacteria are relatively minor and only affect the skin or underlying tissue. Common examples include: boils \u2013 red, painful lumps on the skin that usually develop on the neck, face, armpit or buttocks impetigo \u2013 a highly contagious skin infection that mainly affects children, which can cause sores, blisters and crusts to develop on the skin cellulitis \u2013 an infection of the deep layers of the skin, which can cause affected areas to quickly become red, painful, swollen and hot a skin abscess \u2013 a collection of pus that appears as a painful lump under the surface of the skin folliculitis \u2013 an infection of a hair follicle (small sac in the skin that a hair grows from), which causes an itchy pus-filled bump to develop  wound infections \u2013 an infection of a cut or graze or surgical wound, causing redness, swelling, pain and pus staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) \u2013 a more serious condition that mainly affects babies and young children, where staph bacteria release a toxin that damages the skin, leading to extensive blistering that looks like the skin has been scalded Click on the links above for more information on these conditions, including their symptoms and treatments. Invasive infections In a small number of people, a staph skin infection can lead to a more serious, invasive infection deeper within the body. Examples include: septic arthritis \u2013 a joint infection that causes pain, swelling, redness and tenderness in affected joints osteomyelitis \u2013 a bone infection, usually affecting one of the legs, causing bone pain, restricted movement, and swelling, redness and warmth in the affected area pneumonia \u2013 an infection of the lungs that causes persistent coughing, breathing difficulties and chest pain; this often occurs after a viral illness such as flu endocarditis \u2013 an infection of the inner lining of the heart, causing a fever, chest pain, coughing, weakness and shortness of breath sepsis \u2013 an infection of the blood that causes a high temperature (fever), rapid heartbeat and rapid breathing toxic shock syndrome \u2013 where bacteria release toxins into the blood, which can cause a sudden fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, fainting, dizziness, confusion and a rash Click on the links above for more information about these conditions, including their symptoms and treatments. How you get a staph infection Staph bacteria are common. About one person in every three carries the bacteria harmlessly on their skin, usually inside their nose and on the surface of their armpits and buttocks. However, the bacteria can cause problems if they enter the body through a break in the skin, such as a cut or graze, burn or insect bite. They can also get into your body via medical equipment, such as urinary catheters, openings in the skin where drips are inserted and feeding tubes. Staph bacteria are usually spread between people through close skin contact or by sharing contaminated objects, such as towels or toothbrushes. Occasionally, they can be spread in droplets in the coughs and sneezes of someone carrying the bacteria. Eating food contaminated with staph bacteria can give you food poisoning. This normally develops after eating food, usually meat, that hasn't been cooked or stored properly. Who is affected Staph skin infections are common, particularly among children, teenagers and young adults. Invasive infections are much rarer. Both types of infection can affect healthy people, but more serious infections tend to affect those who: have a weakened immune system because of an underlying medical condition or a side effect of treatment, such as chemotherapy  use medical equipment that goes directly inside their body, such as a urinary catheter have experienced severe trauma to the skin, such as a deep wound or a major burn Treating staph infections Some minor staph infections, including minor boils and food poisoning, don't need specific treatment and will get better on their own within a few days or weeks. In some cases, antibiotic tablets or creams may be recommended to treat the infection, and you may need a minor procedure to drain any pus from under your skin, using a needle or scalpel. Until the infection clears up, you should take precautions to avoid spreading the infection to other people. These include washing your hands regularly, not sharing objects that could become contaminated, regularly cleaning any pus off your skin, and covering the infected area with a dressing or plaster. Invasive staphylococcal infections will often require treatment in hospital, because your body's functions may need to be supported while the infection is treated. The infection will usually be treated with antibiotic injections for several days. Preventing staph infections You can reduce your chances of developing staph infections by: washing your hands with soap and warm water regularly \u2013 particularly if you come into contact with someone who has a staph skin infection keeping your skin clean by having a bath or shower every day keeping any cuts clean and covered not sharing towels, washcloths, bed linen, toothbrushes and razors ensuring that food is both properly cooked and properly chilled \u2013 read more about preventing food poisoning If you experience repeated staph infections and you're found to carry the bacteria on your skin, your doctor may recommend using antibacterial shampoo and nasal cream to kill the bacteria and reduce the risk of further infections.

LDL cholesterol is often referred to as \"bad cholesterol\", and statins reduce the production of it inside the liver. Why have I been offered statins? Having a high level of LDL cholesterol is potentially dangerous, as it can lead to a hardening and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is a general term that describes a disease of the heart or blood vessels. It's the most common cause of death in the UK. The main types of CVD are: coronary heart disease \u2013 when the blood supply to the heart becomes restricted angina \u2013 sharp chest pain, caused by coronary heart disease heart attacks \u2013 when the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked stroke \u2013 when the supply of blood to the brain becomes blocked Your doctor may recommend taking statins if either: you've been diagnosed with a form of CVD your personal and family medical history suggests you're likely to develop CVD at some point over the next 10 years and lifestyle measures (see below) haven't reduced this risk Read more about when statins may be recommended. Taking statins Statins come as tablets that are taken once a day. The tablets should normally be taken at the same time each day \u2013 most people take them just before going to bed. In most cases, treatment with statins continues for life, as stopping the medication causes your cholesterol to return to a high level within a few weeks. If you ever forget to take your dose, don't take an extra one to make up for it. Just take your next dose as usual the following day. If you accidentally take too many statin tablets (more than your usual daily dose), contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice, or call NHS 111. Cautions and interactions Statins can sometimes interact with other medicines, increasing the risk of unpleasant side effects, such as muscle damage. Some types of statin can also interact with grapefruit juice. It's very important to read the information leaflet that comes with your medication, to check if there are any interactions you should be aware of. If in doubt, contact your GP or pharmacist for advice. Read more things to consider when taking statins. Side effects of statins Many people who take statins experience no or very few side effects. Others experience some troublesome \u2013 but usually minor \u2013 side effects, such as an upset stomach, headache or feeling sick. Your doctor should discuss the risks and benefits of taking statins if they're offered to you. Cases that involve more serious side effects, such as kidney failure, tend to get a great deal of media coverage, but these are rare. The British Heart Foundation states than just 1 in every 10,000 people who take statins will experience a potentially dangerous side effect. The risks of any side effects also have to be balanced against the benefits of preventing serious problems. A review of scientific studies into the effectiveness of statins found that around one in every 50 people who take the medication for five years will avoid a serious event, such as a heart attack or stroke, as a result. Read more about the side effects of statins. Alternatives to statins If you're at risk of developing CVD in the near future, your doctor will usually recommend lifestyle measures to reduce this risk before they suggest that you take statins. Lifestyle measures that can reduce your cholesterol level and CVD risk include: eating a healthy, balanced diet exercising regularly maintaining a healthy weight limiting the amount of alcohol you drink stopping smoking Statins may be recommended if these measures don\u2019t help.

It's usually seen in people who are overweight or obese. A healthy liver should contain little or no fat. It's estimated that up to one in every three people in the UK has early stages of NAFLD where there are small amounts of fat in their liver. Early-stage NAFLD doesn't usually cause any harm, but it can lead to serious liver damage, including cirrhosis, if it gets worse. Having high levels of fat in your liver is also associated with an increased risk of problems such as diabetes, heart attacks and strokes. If detected and managed at an early stage, it's possible to stop NAFLD getting worse and reduce the amount of fat in your liver. This page covers: Stages of NAFLD Am I at risk of NAFLD? Symptoms of NAFLD How NAFLD is diagnosed Treatment for NAFLD Stages of NAFLD NAFLD develops in four main stages. Most people will only ever develop the first stage, usually without realising it. In small number of cases it can progress and eventually lead to liver damage if not detected and managed. The main stages of NAFLD are: simple fatty liver (steatosis) \u2013 a largely harmless build-up of fat in the liver cells that may only be diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) \u2013 a more serious form of NAFLD, where the liver has become inflamed; this is estimated to affect up to 5% of the UK population fibrosis \u2013 where persistent inflammation causes scar tissue around the liver and nearby blood vessels, but the liver is still able to function normally cirrhosis \u2013 the most severe stage, occurring after years of inflammation, where the liver shrinks and becomes scarred and lumpy; this damage is permanent and can lead to liver failure (where your liver stops working properly) and liver cancer It can take years for fibrosis or cirrhosis to develop. It's important to make lifestyle changes to prevent the disease from getting worse. Am I at risk of NAFLD? You're at an increased risk of NAFLD if you: are obese or overweight \u2013 particularly if you have a lot of fat around your waist (an \"apple-like\" body shape) have type 2 diabetes have high blood pressure have high cholesterol are over the age of 50 smoke However, NAFLD has been diagnosed in people without any of these risk factors, including young children. Although it's very similar to alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), NAFLD isn't caused by drinking too much alcohol. Symptoms of NAFLD There aren't usually any symptoms of NAFLD in the early stages. You probably won't know you have it unless it's diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason. Occasionally, people with NASH or fibrosis (more advanced stages of the disease) may experience: a dull or aching pain in the top right of the tummy (over the lower right side of the ribs) fatigue (extreme tiredness) unexplained weight loss weakness If cirrhosis (the most advanced stage) develops, you can get more severe symptoms such as yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), itchy skin, and swelling in the legs, ankles, feet or tummy. Read more about the symptoms of cirrhosis. How NAFLD is diagnosed NAFLD is often diagnosed after a blood test called a liver function test produces an abnormal result and other liver conditions, such as hepatitis, are ruled out. However, blood tests don't always pick up NAFLD. The condition may also be spotted during an ultrasound scan of your tummy. This is a type of scan where sound waves are used to create an image of the inside of your body. If you're diagnosed with NAFLD, further tests may be needed to determine which stage you have. This may involve a special blood test or having another type of ultrasound scan (Fibroscan). Some people may also need a small sample of liver tissue (biopsy) taken using a needle to have it analysed in a laboratory. Treatment for NAFLD Most people with NAFLD won't develop any serious problems, but if you're diagnosed with the condition it's a good idea to take steps to stop it getting any worse. There's currently no specific medication for NAFLD, but making healthy lifestyle choices can help and treatment may be recommended for associated conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol) or complications. You may be advised to have regular appointments with your doctor to check your liver function and look for signs of any new problems. Healthy diet and lifestyle Adopting a healthy lifestyle is the main way of managing NAFLD. The following can all help:  Lose weight \u2013 you should aim for a BMI of 18.5-24.9; use the BMI calculator to work out your BMI. Losing more than 10% of your weight can remove some fat from the liver and improve NASH if you have it. Eat a healthy diet \u2013 try to have a balanced diet high in fruits, vegetables, protein and carbohydrates, but low in fat, sugar and salt. Eating smaller portions of food can help too. Exercise regularly \u2013 aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, such as walking or cycling, a week. All types of exercise can help improve NAFLD, even if you don't lose weight. Stop smoking \u2013 if you smoke, stopping can help reduce your risk of problems such as heart attacks and strokes. NAFLD isn't caused by alcohol, but drinking may make the condition worse. It's therefore advisable to cut down or stop drinking alcohol. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol. Medication There isn't currently any medication that can treat NAFLD, but various medicines can be useful in managing the problems associated with the condition. For example, your doctor may recommend medication to treat high blood pressure, treat high cholesterol, treat type 2 diabetes and\/or treat obesity. Liver transplant If you develop severe cirrhosis and your liver stops working properly, you may need to be put on the waiting list for a liver transplant. For adults, the average waiting time for a liver transplant is 145 days for transplants from recently deceased donors. Alternatively, it may be possible to have a transplant using a section of liver removed from a living donor. As the liver can regenerate itself, both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor's liver are able to regrow to a normal size.

The three main features of PCOS are: irregular periods \u2013 which means your ovaries don't regularly release eggs (ovulation) excess androgen \u2013 high levels of \"male hormones\" in your body, which may cause physical signs such as excess facial or body hair (see signs and symptoms below) polycystic ovaries \u2013 your ovaries become enlarged and contain many fluid-filled sacs (follicles) which surround the eggs (it's important to note that, despite the name, if you have PCOS you don't actually have cysts) If you have at least two of these features you may be diagnosed with PCOS. Read more about diagnosing PCOS. Polycystic ovaries Polycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless follicles that are up to 8mm (approximately 0.3in) in size. The follicles are under-developed sacs in which eggs develop. In PCOS, these sacs are often unable to release an egg, which means that ovulation doesn't take place. It's difficult to know exactly how many women have PCOS, but it's thought to be very common affecting about one in every five women in the UK. More than half of these women don't have any symptoms. Signs and symptoms If you do have signs and symptoms of PCOS, they'll usually become apparent during your late teens or early twenties. They can include: irregular periods or no periods at all difficulty getting pregnant as a result of irregular ovulation or failure to ovulate excessive hair growth (hirsutism) \u2013 usually on the face, chest, back or buttocks weight gain thinning hair and hair loss from the head oily skin or acne   PCOS is also associated with an increased risk of developing health problems in later life, such as type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol levels. What causes PCOS? The exact cause of PCOS is unknown, but it often runs in families. It's related to abnormal hormone levels in the body, including high levels of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that controls sugar levels in the body. Many women with PCOS are resistant to the action of insulin in their body and produce higher levels of insulin to overcome this. This contributes to the increased production and activity of hormones such as testosterone. Being overweight or obese also increases the amount of insulin your body produces. Read more about the causes of PCOS. Treating PCOS There's no cure for PCOS, but the symptoms can be treated. Speak to your GP if you think you may have the condition. If you have PCOS and you're overweight, losing weight and eating a healthy, balanced diet can make some symptoms better. Medications are also available to treat symptoms such as excessive hair growth, irregular periods and fertility problems. If fertility medications are ineffective, a simple surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) may be recommended. This involves using heat or a laser to destroy the tissue in the ovaries that's producing androgens, such as testosterone. With treatment, most women with PCOS are able to get pregnant.

It can be used to treat conditions affecting the blood cells, such as leukaemia and lymphoma. Stem cells are special cells produced by bone marrow (a spongy tissue found in the centre of some bones) that can turn into different types of blood cells. The three main types of blood cell they can become are: red blood cells \u2013 which carry oxygen around the body white blood cells \u2013 which help fight infection platelets \u2013 which help stop bleeding A stem cell transplant involves destroying any unhealthy blood cells and replacing them with stem cells removed from the blood or bone marrow. Why are stem cell transplants carried out? Stem cell transplants are used to treat conditions in which the bone marrow is damaged and is no longer able to produce healthy blood cells. Transplants can also be carried out to replace blood cells that are damaged or destroyed as a result of intensive cancer treatment. Conditions that stem cell transplants can be used to treat include: severe aplastic anaemia (bone marrow failure) leukaemia \u2013 a type of cancer affecting white blood cells lymphoma \u2013 another type of cancer affecting white blood cells myeloma \u2013 cancer affecting cells called plasma cells certain blood, immune system and metabolic disorders \u2013 examples include sickle cell anaemia, thalassaemia, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and Hurler syndrome A stem cell transplant will usually only be carried out if other treatments haven't helped, the potential benefits of a transplant outweigh the risks and you're in relatively good health, despite your underlying condition. What does a stem cell transplant involve? A stem cell transplant can involve taking healthy stem cells from the blood or bone marrow of one person \u2013 ideally a close family member with the same or similar tissue type (see below) \u2013 and transferring them to another person. This is called an allogeneic transplant. It's also possible to remove stem cells from your own body and transplant them later, after any damaged or diseased cells have been removed. This is called an autologous transplant. A stem cell transplant has five main stages. These are: Tests and examinations \u2013 to assess your general level of health. Harvesting \u2013 the process of obtaining the stem cells to be used in the transplant, either from you or a donor. Conditioning \u2013 treatment with chemotherapy and\/or radiotherapy to prepare your body for the transplant. Transplanting the stem cells Recovery Having a stem cell transplant can be an intensive and challenging experience. You'll usually need to stay in hospital for a month or more until the transplant starts to take effect and it can take a year or two to fully recover. Read more about what happens during a stem cell transplant. Risks of a stem cell transplant Stem cell transplants are complicated procedures with significant risks. It's important that you're aware of both the risks and possible benefits before treatment begins. Possible problems that can occur during or after the transplant process include: graft versus host disease (GvHD) \u2013 this occurs in allogeneic transplants when the transplanted cells start to attack the other cells in your body reduced number of blood cells \u2013 this can lead to anaemia, excessive bleeding or bruising, and an increased risk of infections chemotherapy side effects \u2013 including sickness, tiredness, hair loss and infertility Read more about the risks of having a stem cell transplant. Stem cell donation If it isn't possible to use your own stem cells for the transplant (see above), stem cells will need to come from a donor. To improve the chances of the transplant being successful, donated stem cells need to carry a special genetic marker \u2013 known as a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) \u2013 that's identical or very similar to that of the person receiving the transplant. The best chance of getting a match is from a brother or sister, or sometimes another close family member. If there are no matches in your close family, a search of the British Bone Marrow Registry will be carried out. Most people will eventually find a donor in the registry, although a small number of people may find it very hard or impossible to find a suitable match. Read more about stem cell donation.

The term 'angioplasty' means using a balloon to stretch open a narrowed or blocked artery. However, most modern angioplasty procedures also involve inserting a short wire-mesh tube, called a stent, into the artery during the procedure. The stent is left in place permanently to allow blood to flow more freely. Coronary angioplasty is sometimes known as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The combination of coronary angioplasty with stenting is usually referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). When a coronary angioplasty is used Like all organs in the body, the heart needs a constant supply of blood. This is supplied by the coronary arteries. In older people, these arteries can become narrowed and hardened (known as atherosclerosis), which can cause coronary heart disease. If the flow of blood to the heart becomes restricted, it can lead to chest pain known as angina, which is usually triggered by physical activity or stress. While angina can often be treated with medication, a coronary angioplasty may be required to restore the blood supply to the heart in severe cases where medication is ineffective. Coronary angioplasties are also often used as an emergency treatment after a heart attack. What are the benefits of a coronary angioplasty? In most cases, the blood flow through the coronary arteries improves after an angioplasty. Many people find their symptoms get significantly better and they\u2019re able to do more than they could before the procedure. If you've had a heart attack, an angioplasty can increase your chances of surviving more than clot-busting medication (thrombolysis). The procedure can also reduce your chances of having another heart attack in the future. How a coronary angioplasty is performed A coronary angioplasty is performed using local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake while the procedure is carried out. A thin flexible tube called a catheter will be inserted into one of your arteries through an incision in your groin, wrist or arm. This is guided to the affected coronary artery using an X-ray video. When the catheter is in place, a thin wire is guided down the length of the affected coronary artery, delivering a small balloon to the affected section of artery. This is then inflated to widen the artery, squashing fatty deposits against the artery wall so blood can flow through it more freely when the deflated balloon is removed. If a stent is being used, this will be around the balloon before it's inserted. The stent will expand when the balloon is inflated and remains in place when the balloon is deflated and removed. A coronary angioplasty usually takes between 30 minutes and two hours. If you're being treated for angina, you'll normally be able to go home later the same day or the day after you have the procedure. You'll need to avoid heavy lifting, strenuous activities and driving for at least a week. If you've been admitted to hospital following a heart attack, you may need to stay in hospital for several days after the angioplasty procedure before going home. Read more about:  what happens during a coronary angioplasty  recovering from a coronary angioplasty How safe is a coronary angioplasty? A coronary angioplasty is one of the most common types of treatment for the heart. Around 75,000 procedures are performed in England each year. Coronary angioplasties are most commonly performed in people aged 65 or older, as they're more likely to have heart disease. As the procedure doesn't involve making major incisions in the body, it's usually carried out safely in most people. Doctors refer to this as a minimally invasive form of treatment. The risk of serious complications from a coronary angioplasty is generally small, but this depends on factors such as: your age your general health whether you've had a heart attack Serious problems that can occur as a result of the procedure include excessive bleeding, a heart attack and a stroke. Read more about the possible complications of a coronary angioplasty. Are there any alternatives? If many coronary arteries have become blocked and narrowed, or the structure of your arteries is abnormal, a coronary artery bypass graft may be considered. This is a type of invasive surgery where sections of healthy blood vessel are taken from other parts of the body and attached to the coronary arteries. Blood is diverted through these vessels, so it bypasses the narrowed or clogged parts of the arteries.

Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is female sterilisation. At a glance: female sterilisation   How it works   Who can have it done   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks of female sterilisation   Where you can get it Female sterilisation is usually carried out under general anaesthetic, but can be carried out under local anaesthetic, depending on the method used. The surgery involves blocking or sealing the fallopian tubes, which link the ovaries to the womb (uterus).  This prevents the woman\u2019s eggs from reaching sperm and becoming fertilised. Eggs will still be released from the ovaries as normal, but they will be absorbed naturally into the woman's body.   At a glance: facts about female sterilisation In most cases, female sterilisation is more than 99% effective, and only one woman in 200 will become pregnant in her lifetime after having it done.  You don't have to think about it every day, or every time you have sex, so it doesn't interrupt or affect your sex life.  Sterilisation can be carried out at any stage of the menstrual cycle. It won't affect hormone levels. You'll still have periods after being sterilised. You will need to use contraception until the operation is done and until your next period or for three months afterwards (depending on the type of sterilisation). As with any surgery, there's a small risk of complications. These include internal bleeding, infection or damage to other organs.  There's a small risk that the operation won't work. Blocked tubes can rejoin immediately or years later.  If the operation fails, this may increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy (when a fertilised egg implants outside the womb, usually in a fallopian tube).  The sterilisation operation is difficult to reverse. Female sterilisation doesn't protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so always use a condom to protect yourself and your partner against them. How female sterilisation works Female sterilisation works by preventing eggs from travelling down the fallopian tubes. This means a woman's eggs cannot meet sperm, and fertilisation cannot happen. How female sterilisation is carried out  Before the operation Recovering after the operation How female sterilisation is carried out There are two main types of female sterilisation: when your fallopian tubes are blocked \u2013 for example, with clips or rings (tubal occlusion)   when implants are used to block your fallopian tubes (hysteroscopic sterilisation, or HS)  It can be a fairly minor operation, with many women returning home the same day. Sterilisation is usually carried out using tubal occlusion. Tubal occlusion First, your surgeon will need to access and examine your fallopian tubes, using either laparoscopy or mini-laparotomy. A laparoscopy is the most common method of accessing the fallopian tubes. The surgeon makes a small cut in your abdominal wall near your belly button and inserts a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a small flexible tube that contains a tiny light and camera. The camera relays images of the inside of your body to a television monitor. This allows the surgeon to see your fallopian tubes clearly. A mini-laparotomy involves a small incision, usually less than 5cm (2 inches), just above the pubic hairline. Your surgeon can then access your fallopian tubes through this incision. A laparoscopy is usually the preferred option because it is faster. However, a mini-laparotomy may be recommended for women who: have had recent abdominal or pelvic surgery are obese (have a body mass index of 30 or over)  have a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (a bacterial infection that can affect the womb and fallopian tubes) Blocking the tubes The fallopian tubes can be blocked using one of the following methods: applying clips \u2013 plastic or titanium clamps are closed over the fallopian tubes  applying rings \u2013 a small loop of the fallopian tube is pulled through a silicone ring, then clamped shut  tying and cutting the tube \u2013 this destroys 3-4cm (1-1.5 inches) of the tube Hysteroscopic sterilisation (fallopian implants) You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published guidance about hysteroscopic sterilisation. In the UK, the brand name of the hysteroscopic sterilisation technique is Essure. The procedure doesn't require cuts to be made in your abdomen so general anaesthetic is not required. Though you may be given a painkiller and \/or a local anaesthetic. A narrow tube with a telescope at the end, called a hysteroscope, is passed through your vagina and cervix. A guidewire is used to insert a tiny piece of titanium metal (called a microinsert) into the hysteroscope, then into each of your fallopian tubes. This means that the surgeon does not need to cut into your body. The implant causes the fallopian tube to form scar tissue around it, which eventually blocks the tube. You should carry on using contraception until an imaging test has confirmed that your fallopian tubes are blocked. This can be done with one or more of the following:  a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) \u2013 a type of X-ray that is taken after a special dye has been injected to show up any blockages in your fallopian tubes  a hysterosalpingo-contrast-sonography (HyCoSy) \u2013 a type of ultrasound scan involving injecting dye into your fallopian tubes The manufacturer of Essure now advises that ultrasound scan is an additional option for checking placement of the implants 3 months after the sterilisation procedure. If the coils of the implant are seen to be in the correct position tubal occlusion can be assumed Removing the tubes (salpingectomy) If blocking the fallopian tubes has been unsuccessful, the tubes may be completely removed. Removal of the tubes is called salpingectomy. Before the operation Your GP will strongly recommend counselling before referring you for sterilisation. Ideally, this should be with you and your partner if appropriate and acceptable. If possible, you should both agree to the procedure, but it is not a legal requirement to get your partner\u2019s permission. Counselling will give you a chance to talk about the operation in detail, and talk about any doubts, worries or questions that you might have. Your GP does have the right to refuse to carry out the procedure or refuse to refer you for the procedure if they do not believe that it is in your best interests. If this is the case, you may have to pay to have a sterilisation privately. If you decide to be sterilised, your GP will usually refer you to a specialist for treatment. This will usually be a gynaecologist at your nearest NHS hospital. A gynaecologist is a specialist in the female reproductive system. If you choose to have a sterilisation, you will be asked to use contraception until the day of the operation, and to continue using it:  until your next period if you are having your fallopian tubes blocked (tubal occlusion)   for around three months if you are having fallopian implants (hysteroscopic sterilisation) Sterilisation can be performed at any stage in your menstrual cycle. Before you have the operation, you will be given a pregnancy test to make sure that you are not pregnant. It is vital to know this because once the surgeon blocks your fallopian tubes, there is a high risk that any pregnancy will become ectopic (when the fertilised egg grows outside the womb, usually in the fallopian tubes). An ectopic pregnancy can be life-threatening because it can cause severe internal bleeding. Recovering after the operation Once you have recovered from the anaesthetic, passed urine and had something to eat, you will be allowed home. If you leave hospital within hours of the operation, ask a relative or friend to pick you up, or take a taxi. The healthcare professionals treating you in hospital will tell you what to expect and how to care for yourself after surgery. They may give you a contact number to call if you have any problems or any questions. If you have had a general anaesthetic, do not drive a car for 48 hours afterwards. This is because even if you feel fine, your reaction times and judgement may not be back to normal. How you will feel It is normal to feel unwell and a little uncomfortable for a few days if you have had a general anaesthetic, and you may have to rest for a couple of days. Depending on your general health and your job, you can normally return to work five days after tubal occlusion. However, you should avoid heavy lifting for about a week. You may have some slight vaginal bleeding. Use a sanitary towel rather than a tampon until this has gone. You may also feel some pain, similar to period pain. You may be prescribed painkillers for this. If the pain or bleeding gets worse, seek medical attention. Caring for your wound If you had tubal occlusion to block your fallopian tubes, you will have a wound with stitches where the surgeon made an incision (cut) into your stomach. Some stitches are dissolvable and disappear on their own, and some will need to be removed. If your stitches need removing, you will be given a follow-up appointment for this. If there is a dressing over your wound, you can normally remove this the day after your operation. After this, you will be able to have a bath or shower as normal. Having sex Your sex drive and enjoyment of sex will not be affected. You can have sex as soon as it is comfortable to do so after the operation. If you had tubal occlusion, you will need to use contraception until your first period to protect yourself from pregnancy. If you had hysteroscopic sterilisation, you will need to use another form of contraception for around three months after surgery. After scans have confirmed that the implants are in the correct position, you will no longer need contraception. Sterilisation will not protect you from STIs, so continue to use barrier contraception such as condoms if you are unsure of your partner's sexual health. Who can have it done? Almost any woman can be sterilised. However, sterilisation should only be considered by women who do not want any more children, or do not want children at all. Once you are sterilised it is very difficult to reverse the process, so it's important to consider the other options available before making your decision. Sterilisation reversal is not usually available on the NHS. Surgeons are more willing to perform sterilisation when women are over 30 years old and have had children, although some younger women who have never had a baby choose it. Advantages and disadvantages of female sterilisation Advantages female sterilisation can be more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy tubal occlusion (blocking the fallopian tubes) and removal of the tubes (salpingectomy) should be effective immediately \u2013 however, doctors strongly recommend that you continue to use contraception until your next period hysteroscopic sterilisation is usually effective after around three months \u2013 research collected by NICE found that the fallopian tubes were blocked after three months in 96% of sterilised women Other advantages of female sterilisation are that: there are rarely any long-term effects on your sexual health it will not affect your sex drive it will not affect the spontaneity of sexual intercourse or interfere with sex (as other forms of contraception can) it will not affect your hormone levels Disadvantages female sterilisation does not protect you against STIs, so you should still use a condom if you are unsure about your partner's sexual health  it is very difficult to reverse a tubal occlusion \u2013 this involves removing the blocked part of the fallopian tube and rejoining the ends, and reversal operations are rarely funded by the NHS a 2015 US study found that around 1 in 50 women who had a hysteroscopic sterilisation required further surgery due to complications such as persistent pain  Risks with tubal occlusion, there is a very small risk of complications, including internal bleeding and infection or damage to other organs it is possible for sterilisation to fail \u2013 the fallopian tubes can rejoin and make you fertile again, although this is rare (about one in 200 women become pregnant in their lifetime after being sterilised) if you do get pregnant after the operation, there is an increased risk that it will be an ectopic pregnancy (when the fertilised egg grows outside the womb, usually in the fallopian tubes) If you miss a period, take a pregnancy test immediately. If the pregnancy test is positive, you must see your GP so that you can be referred for a scan to check if the pregnancy is inside or outside your womb. With hysteroscopic sterilisation, there is a small risk of pregnancy even after your tubes have been blocked. Research collected by NICE has shown that possible complications after fallopian implants can include: pain after the operation \u2013 in one study, nearly eight out of 10 women reported pain afterwards the implants being inserted incorrectly \u2013 this affected two out of 100 women   bleeding after the operation \u2013 many women had light bleeding after the operation, and nearly a third had bleeding for three days Where to get contraception Most types of contraception are available free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. You can get contraception, and information and advice about contraception, at: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraceptive clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics  sexual health clinics \u2013 they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people\u2019s services (call 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic.  Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won't tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.   Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 05\/01\/2015 Next review due: 05\/01\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

They're a man-made version of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands (two small glands that sit on top of the kidneys). Corticosteroids are available in different forms, including: tablets (oral steroids) injections \u2013 which can be into blood vessels, joints or muscles inhalers \u2013 such as mouth or nasal sprays lotions, gels or creams (topical steroids) These pages are about steroid tablets, inhalers and injections. Steroid lotions, creams and gels are covered separately. What are corticosteroids used for? Corticosteroids are mainly used to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. They are used to treat conditions such as: asthma allergic rhinitis and hay fever urticarial (hives) atopic eczema chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) painful and inflamed joints, muscles and tendons lupus inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) \u2013 including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis giant cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica multiple sclerosis (MS) Corticosteroids can also be used to replace certain hormones that are not being produced by the body naturally \u2013 for example, in people with Addison's disease. Possible side effects Corticosteroids will only be prescribed if the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risks. They will also be prescribed at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time. There aren't usually any severe side effects if you take steroid injections, a steroid inhaler, or a short course of steroid tablets. However, prolonged treatment at high doses \u2013 particularly with steroid tablets \u2013 can cause problems in some people. Potential side effects of long-term treatment include: increased appetite \u2013 potentially leading to weight gain acne thinned skin that bruises easily increased risk of infections mood changes, mood swings and depression diabetes high blood pressure  osteoporosis (weak and brittle bones) withdrawal symptoms caused by suppression of the adrenal glands If you have troublesome side effects after taking corticosteroids, don't stop taking your medication until your doctor says it's safe to do so, because of the possibility of these unpleasant withdrawal effects. Your dose may need to be reduced slowly over a few weeks or months, and you may have to have tests to ensure that your adrenal glands are still working properly before stopping corticosteroids altogether, if you have been taking them for a long time. Read more about the side effects of corticosteroids. Cautions and interactions For most people, including pregnant or breastfeeding women, steroid inhalers and injections are safe. However, they will still only be used if a doctor thinks the potential benefits outweigh the risks. As steroid tablets are more likely to cause side effects, there are some circumstances when they shouldn't be used or should only be used with caution. These circumstances include: having an ongoing widespread infection having mental health or behavioural problems \u2013 such as depression or alcohol dependence having certain underlying physical conditions \u2013 such as liver problems, heart failure, high blood pressure or diabetes taking another medication that may interact with corticosteroids Corticosteroids can often be taken while you\u2019re pregnant or breastfeeding, although your doctor will only prescribe them if the risks of not being treated outweigh the risks associated with the medication. Read more about who can use corticosteroids and interactions of corticosteroids. Anabolic steroids Corticosteroids should not be confused with anabolic steroids, which are sometimes used illegally by bodybuilders and athletes to increase muscle strength.

Corticosteroids are hormones that can reduce inflammation (redness and swelling), suppress the immune system and narrow the blood vessels in the skin. Their main purpose is to reduce skin inflammation and irritation. Conditions widely treated with topical corticosteroids include: eczema  seborrhoeic dermatitis \u2013 a condition that causes the skin to become flaky, leading to symptoms such as dandruff psoriasis  nappy rash lichen planus \u2013 a condition that causes an itchy, non-infectious rash discoid lupus erythematosus \u2013 a type of lupus that usually only affects the skin skin irritation caused by insect bites or stings Topical corticosteroids can't cure these conditions, but can help relieve the symptoms. See the separate topic on corticosteroids for information about oral (tablets and capsules), inhaled and injected corticosteroids. Types of topical corticosteroids Topical corticosteroids are available in different strengths, which are determined by the amount of corticosteroid they contain. They can be: mild \u2013 such as hydrocortisone moderate \u2013 such as clobetasone butyrate potent \u2013 such as betamethasone dipropionate very potent \u2013 such as clobetasol propionate Mild corticosteroids can often be bought over the counter from pharmacies, while stronger types are only available on prescription. You will usually be prescribed the lowest strength necessary to control your symptoms. Topical corticosteroids are also available in several different forms, including: solutions \u2013 water- or alcohol-based liquids that are non-greasy and easy to apply, but they can sometimes dry out the skin  lotions \u2013 similar to solutions but thicker; they are often recommended to treat larger areas of skin or hairy areas  creams \u2013 thicker than lotions and often recommended when the affected skin has become moist or is weeping ointments \u2013 liquids containing high levels of oil, which can make them greasy; they are usually recommended to treat skin that has become dry and scaly gels \u2013 more solidified, jelly-like substances, often used to treat areas of the body that are very hairy, such as the scalp mousses \u2013 foam-like substances that are also often used to treat the scalp Some topical corticosteroids are available combined with other substances, such as antibiotics or antifungals to treat infected areas of skin. Using topical corticosteroids Unless instructed otherwise by your doctor, follow the directions on the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication. This will give details of how much to apply and how often. Topical corticosteroids usually only need to be used once or twice a day for a few days or weeks at a time and should only be applied directly to the affected areas of skin. Occasionally, your doctor may suggest using a topical corticosteroid less frequently but over a longer period of time, to help prevent periods where your symptoms worsen. Read more about how to use topical corticosteroids. Safety and side effects If used as directed, topical corticosteroids are a very safe treatment. The most common side effect is a burning or stinging sensation when the medication is applied, but this usually improves as your skin gets used to the treatment. Serious side effects, such as thinning of the skin and changes in skin colour, usually only occur if too much potent or very potent topical corticosteroids are used for a long period. Topical corticosteroids are safe for most people to use, but there are some circumstances where they are not recommended. For example, very potent topical corticosteroids should be avoided if you are pregnant or breastfeeding and shouldn't be used to treat young children. Read more about things to consider before taking topical corticosteroids and the possible side effects of topical corticosteroids. Corticosteroids and anabolic steroids The steroids contained in topical corticosteroids shouldn't be confused with the type of steroids sometimes used (illegally) by bodybuilders and athletes. These are called anabolic steroids. Anabolic steroids contain a type of hormone that helps stimulate tissue growth, particularly muscle tissue. If used correctly, topical corticosteroids don't have any effect on muscle growth or development. Read more about anabolic steroid abuse.

If used in this way, they can cause serious side effects and addiction.  Anabolic steroids are manufactured drugs that mimic the effects of the male hormone testosterone. They have limited medical uses and aren't to be confused with corticosteroids, a different type of steroid drug that's commonly prescribed for a variety of conditions. This page explains the dangers of misusing anabolic steroids, and aims to advise and support those who are addicted to the drugs. It covers: anabolic steroids and the law why people misuse anabolic steroids how they are taken side effects addiction getting help Are anabolic steroids illegal? Anabolic steroids are class C drugs, which can only be sold by pharmacists with a prescription. It's not illegal to possess anabolic steroids for personal use. They can also be imported or exported, as long as this is carried out in person. This means they can't be posted or delivered by a courier or freight service. However, it's illegal to possess, import or export anabolic steroids if it's believed you're supplying or selling them. This includes giving them to friends. The penalty is an unlimited fine, or even a prison sentence. In professional sport, most organisations ban anabolic steroid use and test competitors for banned steroids. Why people misuse anabolic steroids Anabolic steroids are performance-enhancing drugs that increase muscle mass and decrease fat, as well as causing many undesirable effects. Some athletes, weightlifters and bodybuilders take them regularly to improve their physical performance and build up their bodies. However, people of all ages have been known to misuse these drugs, including adolescent boys who suffer from body dysmorphia, an anxiety disorder where the way someone thinks about their body doesn't match the way it looks. Teenage boys and young men may take the drugs because they have reverse anorexia. This is when they don't see themselves as being physically big enough or strong enough. Some people believe taking anabolic steroids will help them become fit and healthy. This isn't true: taking anabolic steroids is a dangerous drug habit. How anabolic steroids are taken Anabolic steroids are usually injected into the muscle, but some are available in tablet form, or as creams or gels that are applied to the skin. Most people who use anabolic steroids are aware of the dangers of taking them, and have ways of getting the desired effect without the undesirable side effects. This involves injecting the drugs for a period of time and then stopping for a rest period before starting again. This is known as \"cycling\". More than one type of anabolic steroid may be used at a time. Users believe this increases the effectiveness, and is known as \"stacking\". The term \"pyramiding\" refers to a combination of both stacking and cycling. One or more anabolic steroid is taken in a low dose. This is gradually increased to a maximum dose over 6 to 12 weeks, before the dose is reduced to zero to give the body a break and the cycle is started again. Users tend to exercise more when they're taking high doses to make the most of their improved performance during this time. Athletes have been known to try to time their injections so the drug is out of their system by the time they're drug tested. Side effects of anabolic steroids Regularly taking anabolic steroids causes a range of male features, not just increased muscle mass. It can also lead to potentially dangerous medical conditions, such as high blood pressure (hypertension) or heart attacks. Physical effects Effects of anabolic steroids in men can include: reduced sperm count infertility shrunken testicles erectile dysfunction baldness breast development increased risk of developing prostate cancer severe acne stomach pain In women, anabolic steroids can cause: facial hair growth and body hair loss of breasts swelling of the clitoris  a deepened voice an increased sex drive problems with periods hair loss severe acne In addition, both men and women who take anabolic steroids can develop any of the following medical conditions: heart attack or stroke liver or kidney tumours high blood pressure (hypertension)  blood clots  fluid retention high cholesterol   Psychological effects Misusing anabolic steroids can also cause the following psychological or emotional effects: aggressive behaviour  mood swings manic behaviour hallucinations and delusions Stunted growth in adolescents Anabolic steroids accelerate bone growth, so if they're misused by adolescents who haven't yet had the growth spurt associated with puberty, the drugs can cause premature ageing of the bones and restricted growth. Sharing needles As anabolic steroids are often injected, there are risks associated with sharing needles. These are the same risks associated with recreational drug use, and include: damage to veins, leading to ulcers or gangrene hepatitis B infection hepatitis C infection HIV transmission Addiction Like many other substances, anabolic steroids are addictive. This means you can crave the drug, require more to get the same effect, and have withdrawal symptoms if you suddenly stop taking them. A person who is addicted to anabolic steroids will continue using them despite experiencing unpleasant physical side effects. When doctors prescribe steroid medication, they always advise coming off the medication slowly by gradually reducing the dose. Coming off anabolic steroids suddenly can result in withdrawal symptoms that include: depression and apathy feelings of anxiety difficulty concentrating insomnia  anorexia  decreased sex drive extreme tiredness (fatigue) headaches  muscle and joint pain Getting help  You should see your GP if you think you're addicted to anabolic steroids. Treatment for an addiction to anabolic steroids will be similar to that of other types of addiction. Your GP may refer you to a specially trained drugs counsellor. They'll discuss your addiction with you, how to safely stop taking steroids, and any obstacles you may face when trying to stop, plus strategies for dealing with those obstacles.

The mucous membrane is the soft layer of tissue that lines the digestive system from the mouth to the anus, as well as the genital tract (reproductive organs) and eyeballs. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is usually caused by an unpredictable adverse reaction to certain medications. It can also sometimes be caused by an infection. The syndrome often begins with flu-like symptoms, followed by a red or purple rash that spreads and forms blisters. The affected skin eventually dies and peels off. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a medical emergency that requires treatment in hospital, often in intensive care or a burns unit. Treatment aims to identify the underlying cause, control the symptoms and prevent complications. Erythema multiforme is a similar, but less severe, skin reaction that's usually caused by infection, particularly herpes viral infections, and a bacteria called mycoplasma that causes chest infections. This topic covers: Symptoms Causes Risk factors Diagnosis Treatment Complications Prevention Symptoms of Stevens-Johnson syndrome Skin pain is the most common symptom of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Flu-like symptoms are also usually present during the initial stages, and may include: feeling generally unwell a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above a headache joint pain a cough After a few days a rash appears, which may look like a target \u2013 darker in the middle and lighter around the outside (see below). The rash isn't usually itchy, and spreads over a number of hours or days. Large blisters then develop on the skin, which after bursting leave painful sores. Facial swelling and swollen lips covered in crusty sores are common features of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The mucous membranes inside your mouth, throat, eyes and genital tract may also become blistered and ulcerated. This can make swallowing painful and lead to serious problems such as dehydration. The surface of the eyes can also sometimes be affected, which if not treated quickly can cause corneal ulcers and vision problems (see Complications of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, below). Causes of Stevens-Johnson syndrome In children, Stevens-Johnson syndrome is usually triggered by a viral infection, such as mumps flu herpes-simplex virus, which causes cold sores Coxsackie virus, which causes Bornholm disease Epstein-Barr virus, which causes glandular fever Less commonly, bacterial infections can also trigger the syndrome. In adults, Stevens-Johnson syndrome is often caused by an adverse reaction to medication. The medications associated with a high risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome are: allopurinol carbamazepine cotrimoxazole and other anti-infective sulfonamides \u2013 including sulfasalazine, sulfadiazine, sulfadoxine and sulfafurazole lamotrigine nevirapine certain types of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \u2013 including meloxicam, piroxicam and tenoxicam phenobarbital phenytoin sertraline As a result of the associated risk, a thorough evaluation of the expected benefits of treatment is required when prescribing the above medications. Doctors are advised to carefully consider using these medications as first-line treatments, particularly if there are safer alternatives. Medications that are classed as having a significant but lower risk of causing Stevens-Johnson syndrome include: other types of NSAIDs \u2013 including diclofenac, indomethacin, lonazolac, etodolac, aceclofenac, sulindac and ketorolac aminopenicillins \u2013 including amoxicillin and bacampicillin cephalosporins \u2013 including cefaclor, cefalexin, cefapirin, cefatrizine, cefixime, cefonicide, cefotiam, cefpodoxime, ceftibutem, ceftriaxone and cefuroxime macrolides \u2013 including azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, midecamycin, pristinamycin, roxithromycin and spiramycin quinolones \u2013 including ciprofloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin tetracyclines \u2013 including doxycycline, metacycline and minocycline It\u2019s important to emphasise that Stevens-Johnson syndrome is rare, and the overall risk of getting the syndrome is low, even for people using \"high risk\" medications (one in 1,000 to one in 100,000). Risk factors Risk factors for Stevens-Johnson syndrome may include: viral infections \u2013 such as herpes, hepatitis, viral pneumonia or HIV a weakened immune system \u2013 as a result of HIV or AIDS, autoimmune conditions, such as lupus, or certain treatments, such as chemotherapy and organ transplants a previous history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome \u2013 if the syndrome was previously caused by medication, you're at risk of it reoccurring if you take the same medication again, or medications from the same family of medications  a family history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome \u2013 if a close family member has had the syndrome, your risk of getting it may be increased Specific genes have also been identified that increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome among certain groups of people. For example, Chinese people with the HLA B1502 gene have experienced Stevens-Johnson syndrome after taking carbamazepine, and allopurinol has also triggered the syndrome in Chinese people with the HLA B1508 gene. Diagnosing Stevens-Johnson syndrome Stevens-Johnson syndrome should be diagnosed by a dermatologist (skin specialist). A diagnosis is often based on a combination of your: symptoms physical examination  medical history (including any medication you've recently taken)  To confirm the diagnosis, a small sample of skin may be removed (biopsy) so that it can be tested in a laboratory. Treating Stevens-Johnson syndrome If Stevens-Johnson syndrome is suspected, you or your child will be immediately referred to hospital for treatment. Without treatment, the symptoms can become very severe and be life-threatening. Severe cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome may need to be treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) or burns unit. The first step is to stop taking any medications that may be causing Stevens-Johnson syndrome. However, it can sometimes be difficult to determine which medication is causing it, so stopping all non-essential medications may be recommended. Treatment for relief of symptoms while in hospital may include: strong painkillers \u2013 to help ease the pain of any raw areas of skin cool, moist compresses held against the skin \u2013 dead skin may be gently removed and a sterile dressing placed over the affected area regularly applying a plain (unscented) moisturiser to the skin replacement fluids \u2013 you may receive fluids and nutrition through a tube that\u2019s passed through your nose and into your stomach (a nasogastric tube) mouthwashes containing anaesthetic and\/or antiseptic \u2013 to temporarily numb your mouth and make swallowing easier a short course of corticosteroid tablets (topical corticosteroids) to control skin inflammation (only on specialist advice) antibiotics \u2013 if blood poisoning (sepsis) is suspected eyedrops or eye ointment \u2013 for eye-related symptoms Once the cause of Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been identified and successfully treated (in the case of an infection), or stopped (in the case of medication), the skin reaction will stop. New skin may start to grow after a few days. However, the length of time it takes to recover from Stevens-Johnson syndrome will depend on how severe it is, and it can sometimes take many weeks or months to fully recover. If the cause was an adverse reaction to medication, you'll need to avoid that medication and possibly other similar medications for the rest of your life. The doctor treating you will be able to advise you further about this. Complications of Stevens-Johnson syndrome As Stevens-Johnson syndrome severely affects the skin and mucous membranes, it can cause a number of complications. These include: skin changes \u2013 when your skin grows back it may be uneven in colour; less commonly, scarring may occur secondary skin infection (cellulitis) \u2013 which can lead to further, serious problems such as blood poisoning (sepsis) problems with internal organs \u2013 organs can become inflamed \u2013 for example, the lungs (pneumonia), heart (myocarditis), kidneys (nephritis) or liver (hepatitis); the oesophagus may also become narrowed and scarred (oesophageal stricture) eye problems \u2013 the rash can cause problems with your eyes which, in mild cases, may be irritation and dry eyes, or in severe cases may result in corneal ulceration, uveitis (inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of the eye) and, possibly, blindness Problems with the sexual organs, such as vaginal stenosis (narrowing of the vagina caused by a build-up of scar tissue), and scarring of the penis, is also a possible complication of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Preventing Stevens-Johnson syndrome If Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been caused by an adverse reaction to a medication, you'll need to avoid taking this medication and other similar medications. Other family members may also want to avoid using the medication in case there\u2019s a genetic susceptibility within your family. If you've had Stevens-Johnson syndrome in the past, and your doctor thinks you're at risk of getting it again in the future, you'll be warned to look out for the symptoms. If you're of Chinese, southeast Asian or Indian descent, genetic testing may be recommended before taking medications, such as carbamazepine and allopurinol, that are known to have an associated risk of causing Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Testing will help determine whether you carry the genes (HLA B1502 and HLA B1508) that have been associated with the syndrome when taking these medications.

The pain and stiffness usually gets better after a few days or weeks, and is rarely a sign of a more serious problem. You can get a painful or stiff neck if you sleep in an awkward position, use a computer for a prolonged period of time, or strain a muscle because of bad posture. Anxiety and stress can also sometimes cause tension in your neck muscles, which can lead to pain in your neck. You can normally manage your symptoms at home by following the advice below. Managing neck pain at home For most of the types of neck pain described above, the advice is generally the same: carry on with your normal daily activities, keep active, and take painkillers to relieve the symptoms. You can also take these steps to manage your pain: take regular doses of paracetamol, ibuprofen, or a combination of the two, to control pain \u2013 ibuprofen gel can be rubbed on to your neck as an alternative to taking tablets (always follow the instructions that come with the medication) try holding a hot water bottle or heat pack to your neck \u2013 this can help reduce the pain and any muscle spasms, although some people find cold packs offer better relief sleep on a low, firm pillow at night \u2013 using too many pillows may force your neck to bend unnaturally check your posture \u2013 bad posture can aggravate the pain, and it may have caused it in the first place avoid wearing a neck collar \u2013 there is no evidence to suggest wearing a neck collar will help to heal your neck, and it's generally better to keep your neck mobile avoid driving if you find it difficult to turn your head \u2013 this may prevent you being able to view traffic if your neck is stiff or twisted, try some neck exercises \u2013 gently tense your neck muscles as you tilt your head up and down and from side to side, and as you carefully twist your neck from left to right; these exercises will help strengthen your neck muscles and improve your range of movement You can find more information about neck exercises on the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy website. When to see your GP See your GP if the pain or stiffness does not improve after a few days or weeks, if you cannot control the pain using ordinary painkillers, or if you are worried your neck pain could have a more serious cause. Your GP will examine your neck and ask some questions to help identify any underlying condition. They may also prescribe a stronger painkiller, such as codeine, to take with your usual over-the-counter painkillers. If you have had neck pain or stiffness for a month or more, your GP may be able to refer you to a physiotherapist. If your symptoms are particularly severe or do not improve, your GP may consider prescribing more powerful medication or referring you to a pain specialist for further treatment. Read more about living with pain for further information and advice about persistent pain. What causes neck pain and stiffness? A twisted or locked neck Some people suddenly wake up one morning to find their neck twisted to one side and stuck in that position. This is known as acute torticollis and is caused by injury to the neck muscles. The exact cause of acute torticollis is unknown, but it may be caused by bad posture, sleeping without adequate neck support, or carrying heavy unbalanced loads (for example, carrying a heavy bag with one arm). Acute torticollis can take up to a week to get better, but it usually only lasts 24 to 48 hours. Wear and tear in the neck Sometimes neck pain is caused by the \"wear and tear\" that occurs to the bones and joints in your neck. This is a type of arthritis called cervical spondylosis. Cervical spondylosis occurs naturally with age. It does not always cause symptoms, although in some people the bone changes can cause neck stiffness. Nearby nerves can also be squashed, resulting in pain that radiates from the arms, pins and needles, and numbness in the hands and legs. Most cases will improve with treatment in a few weeks. Whiplash Whiplash is a neck injury caused by a sudden movement of the head forwards, backwards or sideways. It often occurs after a sudden impact such as a road traffic accident. The vigorous movement of the head overstretches and damages the tendons and ligaments in the neck. As well as neck pain and stiffness, whiplash can cause tenderness in the neck muscles, reduced and painful neck movements, and headaches. Pinched nerve Neck pain caused by a squashed nerve is known as cervical radiculopathy. It's usually caused by one of the discs between the bones of the upper spine (vertebrae) splitting open and the gel inside bulging outwards on to a nearby nerve. The condition is more common in older people because your spinal discs start to lose their water content as you get older, making them less flexible and more likely to split. The pain can sometimes be controlled with painkillers and by following the advice below, although surgery may be recommended for some people. More serious causes Your neck pain may have a more serious cause if it's persistent and getting progressively worse, or you have additional symptoms, such as: a lack of co-ordination \u2013 you may find fiddly tasks increasingly difficult problems walking loss of bladder or bowel control a high temperature (fever) unexplained weight loss A serious cause is more likely if you have recently had a significant injury \u2013 for example, you were involved in a car accident or had a fall \u2013 or you have a history of cancer or conditions that weaken your immune system, such as HIV.

If the baby dies before 24 completed weeks, it's known as a miscarriage or late foetal loss. Stillbirth is more common than many people think. There are more than 3,600 stillbirths every year in the UK, and one in every 200 births ends in a stillbirth. Eleven babies are stillborn every day in the UK, making it 15 times more common than cot death. What causes stillbirth? Around a half of all stillbirths are linked to placental complications. This means that for some reason the placenta (the organ that links the baby's blood supply to the mother's and nourishes the baby in the womb) isn't functioning properly. About 10% of stillborn babies have some kind of birth defect that contributed to their death. A small percentage of stillbirths are caused by problems with the mother's health, for example pre-eclampsia, or other problems, including cord accidents and infections.  Read more about causes of stillbirth. What happens when a baby dies in the womb? If it's suspected that your baby may have died during your pregnancy, a handheld Doppler device or an ultrasound scan can be used to check your baby's heartbeat. If your baby has died and there's no immediate risk to your health, you'll usually be given time to think about what you want to do next. You may be able to choose whether you would like to wait for labour to begin naturally, or if you want it to be started with medication (induced). If your health is at risk, the baby may need to be delivered as soon as possible. It's rare for a stillborn baby to be delivered by caesarean section. At this stage, it's common for parents to ask why their baby died. Those caring for you may give you some basic information about tests to try to find out why your baby died. Read more about how stillbirths happen. After a stillbirth After a stillbirth, many parents want to see and hold their baby. You may also wish to give your baby a name and create memories by taking photographs or a lock of hair. It's completely up to you what you want to do. Decisions about what to do are very personal and there\u2019s no right or wrong way to respond. Finding out why a stillbirth has happened can be helpful with the grieving process and provide information if you want to get pregnant in the future, so you'll be offered tests to try to find out why your baby died. By law, all stillborn babies have to be formally registered. In England and Wales, this must be done within 42 days of your baby's birth. A senior doctor will discuss the test results and post-mortem (if you decided to have one) during a follow-up appointment several weeks after the birth. You may also want to discuss any possible effects on future pregnancies. Read more about what happens after a stillbirth. Help and support Stillbirth and late miscarriage can be devastating for the baby's parents, and they can also affect wider family members, including children and friends. You may find it helpful to discuss your feelings with your GP, community midwife or health visitor, or with other parents who've lost a baby. There are many support groups in the UK for bereaved parents and their families. Find bereavement support services in your area. Some of these groups are run by parents who've experienced stillbirth, or by healthcare professionals, such as baby loss support workers or specialist midwives. Read more about stillbirth support and coping with stillbirth. Can stillbirths be prevented? Not all stillbirths can be prevented. However, there are some things you can do to reduce your risk of having a stillbirth, such as: stopping smoking avoiding alcohol and drugs during pregnancy \u2013 these can seriously affect your baby's development and increase the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth attending all your antenatal appointments so that midwives can monitor the growth and wellbeing of your baby Read more about preventing stillbirth. Information about you If you have experienced a stillbirth, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists to understand more about this complication. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Support groups Sands, the stillbirth and neonatal death charity, provides support for anyone affected by the death of a baby. The charity runs a helpline, provides information and support literature, and funds research into the causes of stillbirth. You can call the Sands confidential helpline on 020 7436 5881, or you can email helpline@uk-sands.org. The helpline is open from 9.30am-5.30pm, Monday to Friday. It's also open later on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, from 6pm-10pm.

But if serious symptoms develop, such as severe pain, swelling or difficulty breathing, dial 999 for an ambulance. Fortunately, there are only a few stinging sea creatures in the seas around the UK. These are: weever fish stingrays sea urchins jellyfish Portuguese man-of-war These are described below. Weever fish Weever fish are small, sandy-coloured fish that usually lie buried in the sand on the seabed. They have poisonous spines on their back and gills that can sting you, usually on your feet or hands. Stingrays Stingrays are flat, circular or diamond-shaped fish that have a sharp, serrated barb underneath their tail. As with weever fish, most people stung by a stingray are stung on their lower legs, ankles and feet after accidentally stepping on one in shallow water. Sea urchins Sea urchins are small, round sea creatures with a bony shell covered in spines. They're usually found in the shallows, on rocks and in seaweed. Sea urchin spines are hard, sharp and can cause puncture wounds. Between the spines are small organs, containing a poison that's released as a defence mechanism. Jellyfish Jellyfish are mushroom-shaped creatures that often float near the surface and have long, thin tentacles on the underside of their bodies. The tentacles are covered with small poisonous sacs called nematocysts which, if touched, produce a nasty sting. During the warmer months in recent years, large groups of jellyfish have become increasingly common in the seas around Europe. Portuguese man-of-war A Portuguese man-of-war is a large, poisonous jellyfish-like creature (although it's not a jellyfish) with a large purple-blue, gas-filled bladder and tentacles that hang below the water. They're usually found in tropical waters, but some have been spotted in UK waters or found washed up on beaches. The sting can be painful, but rarely causes death. Signs and symptoms All stings are painful and cause swelling, inflammation or raised areas of skin (welts) and nausea. You may also have other symptoms, depending on what has stung you. Weever fish and sea urchins usually sting your foot and often leave spines in the wound. Stingrays can leave a large, jagged cut or puncture wound on your skin. Jellyfish and Portuguese men-of-war often leave raised blisters on the skin in the shape of their own tentacles. Read more about the symptoms of sea creature stings. When to seek medical help Seek medical assistance if you've been stung while in the sea and your symptoms are severe \u2013 for example: severe, prolonged pain chest pain or breathing problems severe redness and swelling around the affected area fits or seizures You should also seek medical help if you know you've been stung by a stingray, or if you've been stung on a particularly sensitive part of your body, such as your face or genitals. Less severe marine creature stings can be treated yourself using first aid techniques. Read more about how marine creature stings are treated, both at home and in hospital. Avoiding stings in the sea It's rare to be stung in the seas around the UK, but there are precautions you can take to avoid being stung, including: observing beach warning signs  not touching or handling sea creatures that sting wearing protective clothing, such as a wetsuit or waterproof footwear scuffing your feet as you walk in shallow water to warn any sea creatures that you're approaching Read more about how to prevent being stung in the sea. Healthcare abroad If you're planning a trip abroad, it's a good idea to familiarise yourself with any potentially harmful plants and animals in the countries you'll be visiting. It's also important to have the right travel insurance for the country or countries you visit. Make sure your insurance policy covers specific activities you plan to do, such as water sports or scuba diving. When travelling in Europe, a valid European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) entitles you to free or reduced-cost medical care. However, the EHIC isn't a substitute for travel insurance and doesn't provide the same level of cover \u2013 for example, an EHIC doesn't cover emergency travel back to the UK.

You can be tested for STIs at a sexual health clinic, genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic or GP surgery. Search for a sexual health clinic near you and find out what services they offer. This page provides an overview of the different STIs and links to more information about these conditions. Chlamydia Chlamydia is the most common STI in the UK and is easily passed on during sex. Most people don't experience any symptoms, so they are unaware they're infected. In women, chlamydia can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a vaginal discharge, pain in the lower abdomen during or after sex, and bleeding during or after sex or between periods. It can also cause heavy periods. In men, chlamydia can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a white, cloudy or watery discharge from the tip of the penis, and pain or tenderness in the testicles. It's also possible to have a chlamydia infection in your rectum (bottom), throat or eyes. Diagnosing chlamydia is done with a urine test or by taking a swab of the affected area. The infection is easily treated with antibiotics, but can lead to serious long-term health problems if left untreated, including infertility.  Read more about chlamydia. Genital warts Genital warts are small fleshy growths, bumps or skin changes that appear on or around your genital or anal area. They're caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV) and are the second most common STI in England after chlamydia. The warts are usually painless, but you may notice some itching or redness. Occasionally, they can cause bleeding. You don't need to have penetrative sex to pass the infection on because HPV is spread by skin-to-skin contact. Several treatments are available for genital warts, including creams and freezing the warts (cryotherapy). Read more about genital warts.  Genital herpes Genital herpes is a common infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is the same virus that causes cold sores. Some people develop symptoms of HSV a few days after coming into contact with the virus. Small, painful blisters or sores usually develop, which may cause itching or tingling, or make it painful to urinate. After you've been infected, the virus remains dormant (inactive) most of the time. However, certain triggers can reactivate the virus, causing the blisters to develop again, although they're usually smaller and less painful. It's easier to test for HSV if you have symptoms. Although there's no cure for genital herpes, the symptoms can usually be controlled using antiviral medicines. Read more about genital herpes. Gonorrhoea Gonorrhoea is a bacterial STI easily passed on during sex. About 50% of women and 10% of men don't experience any symptoms and are unaware they're infected. In women, gonorrhoea can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a vaginal discharge (often watery, yellow or green), pain in the lower abdomen during or after sex, and bleeding during or after sex or between periods, sometimes causing heavy periods. In men, gonorrhoea can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a white, yellow or green discharge from the tip of the penis, and pain or tenderness in the testicles. It's also possible to have a gonorrhoea infection in your rectum, throat or eyes. Gonorrhoea is diagnosed using a urine test or by taking a swab of the affected area. The infection is easily treated with antibiotics, but can lead to serious long-term health problems if left untreated, including infertility. Read more about gonorrhoea. Syphilis Syphilis is a bacterial infection that in the early stages causes a painless, but highly infectious, sore on your genitals or around the mouth. The sore can last up to six weeks before disappearing. Secondary symptoms such as a rash, flu-like illness or patchy hair loss may then develop. These may disappear within a few weeks, after which you'll have a symptom-free phase. The late or tertiary stage of syphilis usually occurs after many years, and can cause serious conditions such as heart problems, paralysis and blindness. The symptoms of syphilis can be difficult to recognise. A simple blood test can usually be used to diagnose syphilis at any stage. The condition can be treated with antibiotics, usually penicillin injections. When syphilis is treated properly, the later stages can be prevented. Read more about syphilis. HIV HIV is most commonly passed on through unprotected sex. It can also be transmitted by coming into contact with infected blood \u2013 for example, sharing needles to inject steroids or drugs. The HIV virus attacks and weakens the immune system, making it less able to fight infections and disease. There's no cure for HIV, but there are treatments that allow most people to live a long and otherwise healthy life. AIDS is the final stage of an HIV infection, when your body can no longer fight life-threatening infections. Most people with HIV look and feel healthy and have no symptoms. When you first develop HIV, you may experience a flu-like illness with a fever, sore throat or rash. This is called a seroconversion illness. A simple blood test is usually used to test for an HIV infection. Some clinics may also offer a rapid test using a finger-prick blood test or saliva sample. Read more about HIV and AIDS and coping with a positive HIV test. Trichomoniasis Trichomoniasis is an STI caused by a tiny parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). It can be easily passed on through sex and most people don't know they're infected. In women, trichomoniasis can cause a frothy yellow or watery vaginal discharge that has an unpleasant smell, soreness or itching around the vagina, and pain when passing urine. In men, trichomoniasis rarely causes symptoms. You may experience pain or burning after passing urine, a whitish discharge, or an inflamed foreskin. Trichomoniasis can sometimes be difficult to diagnose and your GP may suggest you go to a specialist clinic for a urine or swab test. Once diagnosed, it can usually be treated with antibiotics. Read more about trichomoniasis. Pubic lice Pubic lice (\"crabs\") are easily passed to others through close genital contact. They're usually found in pubic hair, but can live in underarm hair, body hair, beards and occasionally eyebrows or eyelashes. The lice crawl from hair to hair but don't jump or fly from person to person. It may take several weeks for you to notice any symptoms. Most people experience itching, and you may notice the lice or eggs on the hairs. Pubic lice can usually be successfully treated with special creams or shampoos available over the counter in most pharmacies or from a GP or GUM clinic. You don't need to shave off your pubic hair or body hair. Read more about pubic lice. Scabies Scabies is caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin. It can be passed on through close body or sexual contact, or from infected clothing, bedding or towels. If you develop scabies, you may have intense itching that's worse at night. The itching can be in your genital area, but it also often occurs between your fingers, on wrists and ankles, under your arms, or on your body and breasts. You may have a rash or tiny spots. In some people, scabies can be confused with eczema. It's usually very difficult to see the mites. Scabies can usually be successfully treated using special creams or shampoos available over the counter in most pharmacies, or from a GP or GUM clinic. The itching can sometimes continue for a short period, even after effective treatment. Read more about scabies.

The opening is known as a stoma. A special bag is placed over the stoma to collect waste products that usually pass through the colon (large intestine) and out of the body through the rectum and back passage (anus). Ileostomy procedures are relatively common in the UK. More than 9,000 are carried out each year in England. When is an ileostomy needed? Ileostomies are formed to either temporarily or permanently stop digestive waste passing through the full length of the small intestine or colon. There are a number of reasons why this may be necessary, including: to allow the small intestine or colon to heal after it's been operated on \u2013 for example, if a section of bowel has been removed to treat bowel cancer to relieve inflammation of the colon in people with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis to allow for complex surgery to be carried out on the anus or rectum Read more about why ileostomy procedures are carried out. The ileostomy procedure Before an ileostomy is formed, you'll normally see a specialist stoma nurse to discuss exactly where you'd like your stoma to be (usually somewhere on the right-hand side of the abdomen) and to talk about living with a stoma. There are two main types of ileostomy: loop ileostomy \u2013 where a loop of small intestine is pulled out through a cut (incision) in your abdomen, before being opened up and stitched to the skin to form a stoma end ileostomy \u2013 where the ileum is separated from the colon and is brought out through the abdomen to form a stoma Alternatively, it's sometimes possible for an internal pouch to be created that's connected to your anus (ileo-anal pouch). This means there's no stoma and stools are passed out of your back passage in a similar way to normal. End ileostomies and ileo-anal pouches are usually permanent. Loop ileostomies are usually intended to be temporary and can be reversed during an operation at a later date. Read more about: How an ileostomy is formed  Reversing an ileostomy After surgery You may need to stay in hospital for up to two weeks after an ileostomy operation. During this time you'll be taught how to look after your stoma by a specialist stoma nurse. Recovering from the procedure can be challenging. Many people experience short-term physical and psychological problems, ranging from skin irritation around the stoma to feelings of anxiety and self-consciousness. However, with practise and support from a designated stoma nurse, many people adjust and often find their quality of life improves after surgery. This is especially true if they've been living for years with a condition such as Crohn's disease. Read more about: Recovering from an ileostomy procedure Living with an ileostomy Complications As with any surgical procedure, having an ileostomy carries a risk of complications. Some of the problems people with an ileostomy experience include: a bowel obstruction \u2013 where the output of digestive waste is blocked vitamin B12 deficiency \u2013 caused by the removal of part of the intestine that absorbs vitamin B12 stoma problems \u2013 such as widening or narrowing of the stoma, making it difficult to attach the external bag Read more about the risks of having an ileostomy.

It's usually short-lived and is often not serious. Severe abdominal pain is a greater cause for concern. If it starts suddenly and unexpectedly, it should be regarded as a medical emergency, especially if the pain is concentrated in a particular area. Call your GP as soon as possible or go to your nearest hospital accident and emergency (A&E) department if this is the case. If you feel pain in the area around your ribs, read about chest pain for information and advice. Stomach cramps with bloating Stomach cramps with bloating are often caused by trapped wind. This is a very common problem that can be embarrassing, but is easily dealt with. Your chemist will be able to recommend a product such as buscopan or mebeverine, which can be bought over the counter to treat the problem. Sudden stomach cramps with diarrhoea If your stomach cramps have started recently and you also have diarrhoea, the cause may be a tummy bug (gastroenteritis). This means you have a viral or bacterial infection of the stomach and bowel, which should get better without treatment after a few days. Gastroenteritis may be caused by coming into close contact with someone who's infected, or by eating contaminated food (food poisoning). If you have repeated bouts of stomach cramps and diarrhoea, you may have a long-term condition, such as irritable bowel syndrome. Sudden severe abdominal pain If you have sudden agonising pain in a particular area of your tummy, call your GP immediately or go to your nearest A&E department. It may be a sign of a serious problem that could rapidly get worse without treatment. Serious causes of sudden severe abdominal pain include: appendicitis \u2013 the swelling of the appendix (a finger-like pouch connected to the large intestine), which causes agonising pain in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen, and means your appendix will need to be removed a bleeding or perforated stomach ulcer \u2013 a bleeding, open sore in the lining of your stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) acute cholecystitis \u2013 inflammation of the gallbladder, which is often caused by gallstones; in many cases, your gallbladder will need to be removed kidney stones \u2013 small stones may be passed out in your urine, but larger stones may block the kidney tubes, and you'll need to go to hospital to have them broken up diverticulitis \u2013 inflammation of the small pouches in the bowel that sometimes requires treatment with antibiotics in hospital If your GP suspects you have one of these conditions, they may refer you to hospital immediately. Sudden and severe pain in your abdomen can also sometimes be caused by an infection of the stomach and bowel (gastroenteritis). It may also be caused by a pulled muscle in your abdomen or by an injury. Long-term or recurring abdominal pain See your GP if you or your child have persistent or repeated abdominal pain. The cause is often not serious and can be managed. Possible causes in adults include: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \u2013 a common condition that causes bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea or constipation; the pain is often relieved when you go to the toilet inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) \u2013 long-term conditions that involve inflammation of the gut, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis a urinary tract infection that keeps returning \u2013 in these cases, you will usually also experience a burning sensation when you urinate constipation  period pain \u2013 painful muscle cramps in women that are linked to the menstrual cycle other stomach-related problems \u2013 such as a stomach ulcer, heartburn and acid reflux, or gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining) Possible causes in children include: constipation a urinary tract infection that keeps returning heartburn and acid reflux  abdominal migraines \u2013 recurrent episodes of abdominal pain with no identifiable cause Page last reviewed: 15\/12\/2014 Next review due: 15\/12\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Around 7,000 people are diagnosed with it each year in the UK. The initial symptoms of stomach cancer are vague and easy to mistake for other less serious conditions. They include: persistent indigestion and heartburn trapped wind and frequent burping feeling very full or bloated after meals persistent stomach pain Symptoms of advanced stomach cancer can include: blood in your stools, or black stools loss of appetite weight loss As the early symptoms of stomach cancer are similar to those of many other conditions, the cancer is often advanced by the time it's diagnosed. It's therefore important to get any possible symptoms of stomach cancer checked by your GP as soon as possible. Read more about diagnosing stomach cancer. Who's affected The exact cause of stomach cancer is still unclear, although you're more likely to develop it if you: are male are 55 years of age or older smoke have a diet low in fibre and high in processed food or red meat have a diet that contains a lot of salted and pickled foods have a stomach infection caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria  Read more about the causes of stomach cancer. Types of stomach cancer There are several different types of stomach cancer. More than 95% of stomach cancers develop in the cells of the stomach lining and are known as adenocarcinomas. Less common types of stomach cancer include lymphoma of the stomach, which develops in the lymphatic tissue (tissue that drains away fluid and helps fight infection), and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs), which develop in the muscle or connective tissue of the stomach wall. How stomach cancer is treated Many cases of stomach cancer can't be completely cured, but it's still possible to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life using chemotherapy and in some cases radiotherapy and surgery. If operable, surgery can cure stomach cancer as long as all of the cancerous tissue can be removed. Surgery to remove some or all of the stomach is known as a gastrectomy. It will still be possible to eat normally after a gastrectomy, but you'll probably have to adjust the size of your portions.  Chemotherapy can also be used before surgery to help shrink the tumour and sometimes after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning. Read more about treating stomach cancer. Living with stomach cancer Living with stomach cancer and the effects of surgery can be tough, but there are a range of services that can provide social, psychological and financial support. Read more about living with stomach cancer. Outlook The outlook for stomach cancer depends on several factors, including your age, your general health, and how far the cancer has spread (the stage of the condition). Unfortunately, as stomach cancer isn't often picked up until the later stages, the outlook isn't as good as for some other cancers. Of all those with stomach cancer, about: 42 out of 100 people (42%) will live for at least one year after diagnosis 19 out of 100 people (19%) will live for at least five years after diagnosis 15 out of every 100 people (15%) will live for at least 10 years after diagnosis In the UK, around 5,000 people die from stomach cancer each year. The stomach The stomach is a hollow sac of muscle that's connected to the oesophagus (gullet) at its top and the first section of the small intestine (duodenum) at its bottom. The stomach's main purpose is to break down solid food into a semi-solid consistency using stomach acid. This makes it easier for the rest of the digestive system to absorb nutrients from the food.

There are four types of gastrectomy: total gastrectomy \u2013 the whole stomach is removed partial gastrectomy \u2013 the lower part of the stomach is removed sleeve gastrectomy \u2013 the left side of the stomach is removed oesophagogastrectomy \u2013 the top part of the stomach and part of the oesophagus (gullet) is removed The stomach is connected to the gullet (oesophagus) at its top and the first sections of the duodenum (small intestine) at its bottom. During the operation, the surgeon connects the oesophagus either to the small intestine or the remaining section of stomach. This means that you'll still have a working digestive system, although it won't function as well as it did before. Read more about how a gastrectomy is performed. Why is a gastrectomy carried out? A gastrectomy is often used to treat stomach cancer. Less commonly, it's used to treat: life-threatening obesity oesophageal cancer stomach ulcers (peptic ulcers) non-cancerous tumours Read more about why a gastrectomy is used. After a gastrectomy A gastrectomy is a major operation, so recovery can take a long time. You'll usually have to stay in hospital for one or two weeks after the procedure, where you may receive nutrition into a vein until you can eat and drink again. You'll eventually be able to digest most foods and liquids. However, you may need to make changes to your diet, such as eating frequent, smaller meals rather than three large meals a day. You may also need vitamin supplements to ensure you're getting the correct nutrition. In many cases, a gastrectomy is an effective operation. Studies show that survival rates for cancer after a gastrectomy are generally good. It's also been proven that people who have the operation to treat obesity lose a significant amount of weight afterwards. Read more about recovering from a gastrectomy. Results Gastrectomy is usually an effective treatment for cancer and obesity. Cancer Healthcare professionals use the phrase \"five-year disease-free survival\" to refer to people who are alive and well, and whose cancer hasn't returned five years after having surgery. The five-year disease-free survival rate for people who have a gastrectomy for early-stage stomach cancer is estimated to be up to 90%. The five-year disease-free survival rate for people who have a gastrectomy for advanced stomach cancer is estimated to be around 25%. However, many people who have a gastrectomy for stomach cancer live for much longer than five years without the cancer returning. The survival rate of oesophagogastrectomy to treat cancer isn't as good. Studies have shown five-year disease-free survival rates of around 25% for this type of operation. This may be because this operation is usually done if the cancer is discovered at a late stage and has already started to spread. Obesity Sleeve gastrectomy has a good success rate for treating obesity. Studies have found excess weight loss of up to 75% after surgery. Excess weight loss is a measurement based on your weight before surgery and your ideal weight. Further research is needed to determine how effective sleeve gastrectomy is for the long-term treatment of obesity. Studies often show that average excess weight declines over time, which suggests that some people regain some of the weight they initially lost. To get the best results from a sleeve gastrectomy, it's important to follow the instructions given by your healthcare team about diet and exercise. Complications As with any type of surgery, a gastrectomy carries a risk of complications, such as infection, bleeding and leaking from the area that's been stitched together. A gastrectomy may also lead to problems caused by a reduction in your ability to absorb vitamins, such as anaemia and osteoporosis.  Read more about the possible complications of a gastrectomy.

Ulcers can also occur in part of the intestine just beyond the stomach \u2013 these are known as duodenal ulcers. Both stomach and duodenal ulcers are sometimes referred to as peptic ulcers. Here the term \u201Cstomach ulcer\u201D will be used, although the information applies equally to duodenal ulcers. Signs and symptoms The most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain in the centre of the abdomen (tummy). However, stomach ulcers aren't always painful and some people may experience other symptoms, such as indigestion, heartburn and feeling sick. Read more about the symptoms of a stomach ulcer and diagnosing a stomach ulcer. When to seek medical advice You should visit your GP if you think you may have a stomach ulcer. Seek urgent medical advice if you experience any of the following symptoms: vomiting blood \u2013 the blood can appear bright red or have a dark brown, grainy appearance, similar to coffee grounds passing dark, sticky, tar-like stools a sudden, sharp pain in your tummy that gets steadily worse These could be a sign of a serious complication, such as internal bleeding (see below). What causes stomach ulcers? Stomach ulcers occur when the layer that protects the stomach lining from stomach acid breaks down, which allows the stomach lining to become damaged. This is usually a result of : an infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or aspirin \u2013 particularly if they're taken for a long time or at high doses It used to be thought that stress or certain foods might cause stomach ulcers, but there's little evidence to suggest this is the case. Read more about the causes of stomach ulcers. Who is affected It's not known how many people have stomach ulcers, although they're thought to be quite common. Some studies have found that around 1 in 10 people may get a stomach ulcer at some point in their life. Stomach ulcers can affect people of any age, including children, but mostly occur in people aged 60 or over. Men are more commonly affected than women. How stomach ulcers are treated With treatment, most stomach ulcers will heal within a month or two. The treatment recommended for you will depend on what caused the ulcer. Most people will be prescribed a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce the amount of acid their stomach produces, and allow the ulcer to heal naturally. If an H. pylori infection is responsible for the ulcers, antibiotics will also be used to kill the bacteria, which should prevent the ulcer coming back. If the ulcers are caused by the use of NSAIDs, PPIs are usually prescribed and your doctor will discuss whether you should keep using NSAIDs. Alternative medication to NSAIDs, such as paracetamol, may be recommended. Stomach ulcers can come back after treatment, although this is less likely to happen if the underlying cause is addressed. Read more about treating stomach ulcers. Possible complications Complications of stomach ulcers are relatively uncommon, but they can be very serious and potentially life-threatening. The main complications include: bleeding at the site of the ulcer the stomach lining at the site of the ulcer splitting open \u2013 known as perforation the ulcer blocking the movement of food through the digestive system \u2013 known as gastric obstruction Read more about the complications of stomach ulcers.

Most women have a period every 28 days or so, but it's common to have a slightly shorter or longer cycle than this (from 24 to 35 days). Some women don't always have a regular menstrual cycle. Their period may be early or late, and how long it lasts and how heavy it is may vary each time. Read more about irregular periods and heavy periods. This page covers: Why your periods might stop When to see your GP Why your periods might stop There are a number of reasons why your periods can stop. The most common reasons are: pregnancy  stress  sudden weight loss  being overweight or obese extreme overexercising  taking the contraceptive pill reaching the menopause  polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)  Periods can also sometimes stop as a result of a long-term medical condition, such as heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes, an overactive thyroid, or premature ovarian failure. Pregnancy You might be pregnant if you're sexually active and your period is late. Pregnancy is a common reason why periods unexpectedly stop. It can sometimes happen if the contraception you're using fails. It might be that your period is simply late, so you could wait a few days to see if it arrives. If it doesn't arrive, you can do a pregnancy test to confirm whether or not you're pregnant. It's important to be aware that you can get pregnant in the days after your period is normally due. This can happen if the release of an egg (ovulation) is delayed \u2013 for example, as a result of illness or stress. Stress If you're stressed, your menstrual cycle can become longer or shorter, your periods may stop altogether, or they might become more painful. Try to avoid becoming stressed by making sure you have time to relax. Regular exercise, such as running, swimming and yoga, can help you relax. Breathing exercises can also help. If you're finding it hard to cope with stress, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be recommended. CBT is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and act. Sudden weight loss Excessive or sudden weight loss can cause your periods to stop. Severely restricting the amount of calories you eat stops the production of hormones needed for ovulation. Your GP may refer you to a dietitian if you're underweight, where you have a body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5. The dietitian will be able to advise you about how to regain weight safely. If your weight loss is caused by an eating disorder, such as anorexia, you'll be referred to a psychiatrist. Being overweight or obese Being overweight or obese can also affect your menstrual cycle. If you're overweight, your body may produce an excess amount of oestrogen, one of the hormones that regulate the reproductive system in women. The excess oestrogen can affect how often you have periods, and can also cause your periods to stop. Your GP may refer you to a dietitian if you're overweight or obese, with a BMI of 30 or more, and it's affecting your periods. The dietitian will be able to advise you about losing weight safely. Extreme overexercising The stress that intense physical activity places on your body can affect the hormones responsible for your periods. Losing too much body fat through intense exercise can also stop you ovulating. You'll be advised to reduce your level of activity if excessive exercise has caused your periods to stop. If you're a professional athlete, you may benefit from seeing a doctor who specialises in sports medicine. They'll be able to give you advice about how to maintain your performance without disrupting your periods. Contraceptive pill You might miss a period every so often if you're taking the contraceptive pill. This isn't usually a cause for concern. Some types of contraception, such as the progestogen-only pill, contraceptive injection and intrauterine system (IUS), particularly Mirena, can cause periods to stop altogether. However, your periods should return when you stop using these types of contraception. Menopause You may start missing periods as you approach the menopause. This is because oestrogen levels will start to decrease, and ovulation will become less regular. After the menopause, your periods will stop completely. The menopause is a natural part of the ageing process in women, which usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55. The average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 51 in the UK. However, around 1 in 100 women experience the menopause before the age of 40. This is known as premature menopause or premature ovarian failure. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Polycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless follicles, which are underdeveloped sacs in which eggs develop. If you have PCOS, these sacs are often unable to release an egg, which means ovulation doesn't take place. PCOS is thought to be very common, affecting about 1 in every 10 women in the UK. The condition is responsible for as many as one in three cases of stopped periods. When to see your GP See your GP if you're not pregnant \u2013 you've had a negative pregnancy test \u2013 and you've missed more than three periods in a row. If you're sexually active and you haven't taken a pregnancy test, your GP may advise you to take one. They may also ask you about: your medical history your family's medical history your sexual history any emotional issues you're having any recent changes in your body weight the amount of exercise you do Your GP may recommend waiting to see whether your periods return on their own. In some cases you may need treatment for your periods to return. You should also see your GP if your periods stop before you're 45 or you're still bleeding when you're over 55.

They're often present at birth or develop soon afterwards. There are several different types of birthmark and some of them are very common. The two main types of birthmark are: vascular birthmarks (often red, purple or pink) caused by abnormal blood vessels in or under the skin pigmented birthmarks (usually brown) caused by clusters of pigment cells Vascular birthmarks often occur in the head and neck area, mainly on the face. But both types of birthmark can appear anywhere, including inside the body. If surface blood vessels are affected, a vascular birthmark will appear red, purple or pink. If the affected vessels are deep, the birthmark will appear blue. Pigmented birthmarks are tan or brown-coloured skin marks. Vascular birthmarks Some of the most common types of vascular birthmarks are described below. Salmon patch (stork mark) Salmon patches are flat red or pink patches that can appear on a baby's eyelids, neck or forehead at birth. They're the most common type of vascular birthmark and occur in around half of all babies. Most salmon patches will fade completely within a few months, but if they occur on the forehead they may take up to four years to disappear. Patches on the back of the neck can last longer. Salmon patches are often more noticeable when a baby cries because they fill with blood and become darker. Infantile haemangioma Infantile haemangiomas, also known as strawberry marks, are raised marks on the skin that are usually red. They can appear anywhere on the body. Sometimes infantile haemangiomas occur deeper in the skin, in which case the skin can look blue or purple. Haemangiomas are common, particularly in girls, and affect around 5% of babies soon after birth. They rapidly increase in size for the first six months before eventually shrinking and disappearing by around seven years of age. Haemangiomas that get bigger rapidly, or those that interfere with vision or feeding, may need to be treated. Capillary malformation (port wine stain) Capillary malformation, also known as port wine stains, are flat red or purple marks that affect a very small number of newborn babies. They can vary in size, from a few millimetres to several centimetres in diameter. Port wine stains often affect one side of the body and usually occur on the face, chest and back (although they can occur anywhere). They tend to be sensitive to hormones and may become more noticeable around puberty, pregnancy and the menopause. Most are permanent and may deepen in colour over time. Pigmented birthmarks Some of the most common types of pigmented birthmarks are described below. Café-au-lait spots Café-au-lait spots are coffee-coloured skin patches. Many children have one or two, but if more than six have developed by the time the child is five, you should see your GP. It could be a sign of neurofibromatosis (a number of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along the nerves). Mongolian spots Mongolian spots are blue-grey or bruised-looking birthmarks that are present from birth. They're more commonly seen in darker-skinned people and usually occur over the lower back or buttocks. However, they can also appear elsewhere on the body or limbs. Mongolian spots may last for months or years, but they usually disappear by the time a child reaches four years of age. They're completely harmless and don't need treatment. They may sometimes be mistaken for a bruise. Congenital melanocytic naevi Congenital melanocytic naevi are also known as congenital moles. They're relatively large brown or black moles that are present from birth. They're fairly common and are caused by an overgrowth of pigment cells in the skin. Most congenital melanocytic naevi become proportionally smaller and less obvious with time, although they may darken during puberty or become bumpy or hairy. They can range in size from less than 1.5cm (about 0.6 inches) to more than 20cm (about 7.9 inches) in diameter. The risk of a naevi developing into skin cancer is low, but the risk increases the larger it is. What causes birthmarks? It's not fully understood why birthmarks occur, but they're not usually inherited. Vascular birthmarks are caused by abnormal blood vessels in or under the skin, and pigmented birthmarks are caused by clusters of pigment cells. Port wine stains are thought to occur because the nerves that control the widening or narrowing of the capillaries (tiny blood vessels) don't function properly, or there aren't enough of them. This means that blood is constantly supplied to the skin in that area, which makes it permanently red or purple in colour. Port wine stains are sometimes related to other conditions, such as Sturge-Weber syndrome and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. Read more about the complications associated with birthmarks. Treating birthmarks Most birthmarks are harmless and don't need to be treated. Some types of birthmarks will fade over time, whereas other types such as port wine stains will be permanent if they're not treated. In some cases, a birthmark will need to be treated for medical reasons \u2013 for example, if a haemangioma blocks the airways, affects vision or becomes ulcerated. Some people may also decide to seek treatment for cosmetic reasons.

They normally get better within a week. Most are caused by minor illnesses such as colds or flu and can be treated at home. This page covers: Treatments and remedies Causes of a sore throat When to get medical advice When to get emergency help Treatments for a sore throat The following measures can often help soothe a sore throat: take ibuprofen or paracetamol \u2013 paracetamol is better for children and for people who can't take ibuprofen (note that children under 16 should never take aspirin) drink plenty of cool or warm fluids, and avoid very hot drinks eat cool, soft foods avoid smoking and smoky places gargle with a homemade mouthwash of warm, salty water suck lozenges, hard sweets, ice cubes or ice lollies \u2013 but don't give young children anything small and hard to suck because of the risk of choking There are also products such as medicated lozenges and sprays sold in pharmacies that you may want to try. There isn't much scientific evidence to suggest they help, although some people find them worth using. Antibiotics aren't usually prescribed for a sore throat, even if it's caused by a bacterial infection, as they're unlikely to make you feel better any quicker and they can have unpleasant side effects. Causes of a sore throat The cause of a sore throat isn't always obvious. But in most cases it's a symptom of a viral or bacterial infection. Common causes A sore throat is often a symptom of: colds or flu \u2013 you may also have a blocked or runny nose, a cough, a high temperature (fever), a headache and general aches laryngitis (inflammation of the voice box) \u2013 you may also have a hoarse voice, a dry cough and a constant need to clear your throat tonsillitis (inflammation of the tonsils) \u2013 you may also have red or spotty tonsils, discomfort when swallowing and a fever strep throat (a bacterial throat infection) \u2013 you may also have swollen glands in your neck, discomfort when swallowing and tonsillitis glandular fever \u2013 you may also feel very tired and have a fever and swollen glands in your neck It may also be caused by something irritating your throat, such as smoke, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (where acid leaks up from the stomach) and allergies. Less common causes Less often, a sore throat can be a sign of: quinsy (a painful collection of pus at the back of the throat) \u2013 the pain may be severe and you may also have difficulty opening your mouth or difficulty swallowing epiglottitis (inflammation of the flap of tissue at the back of the throat) \u2013 the pain may be severe and you may have difficulty breathing and difficulty swallowing These conditions are more serious and should be seen by a doctor as soon as possible (see below). When to get medical advice You don't usually need to get medical advice if you have a sore throat. But it's a good idea to contact your GP or NHS 111 if: your symptoms are severe you have persistent symptoms that haven't started to improve after a week you experience severe sore throats frequently you have a weak immune system \u2013 for example, you have HIV, are having chemotherapy, or are taking medication that suppresses your immune system When to get emergency help Very rarely, a sore throat can be a sign of a serious problem. Visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department or call 999 for an ambulance immediately if: your symptoms are severe or getting worse quickly you have difficulty breathing you're making a high-pitched sound as you breathe (called stridor) you have difficulty swallowing you start drooling Page last reviewed: 04\/07\/2016 Next review due: 04\/07\/2019 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

There are many different types of Streptococci bacteria, and infections vary in severity from mild throat infections to life-threatening infections of the blood or organs. Most streptococcal infections can be treated with antibiotics. Streptococci are divided into two key groups: alpha-haemolytic \u2013 made up of two groups, including Streptococcus pneumoniae beta-haemolytic \u2013 made up of several groups, including Group A and Group B streptococci This topic focuses on Group A and Group B beta-haemolytic streptococci. Read about pneumococcal infections for information on infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Group A strep Group A strep (strep A) are often found on the surface of the skin and inside the throat. They are a common cause of infection in adults and children. They can be spread in droplets in the coughs or sneezes of someone with an infection, or through direct contact with an infected person or contaminated object. Minor strep A infections Most infections caused by strep A are unpleasant, but don't pose a serious threat to your health. These include: throat infections (pharyngitis or \"strep throat\") and tonsillitis \u2013 which can cause a sore throat, swollen glands and discomfort when swallowing impetigo \u2013 a skin infection that can cause sores, blisters and crusts to develop on the skin cellulitis \u2013 an infection of the deeper layers of the skin, which can cause affected areas to quickly become red, painful, swollen and hot a middle ear infection \u2013 which often causes earache, a high temperature (fever) and some temporary hearing loss sinusitis \u2013 an infection of the small cavities behind the forehead and cheekbones, which causes a blocked or runny nose and a throbbing pain in your face scarlet fever \u2013 an infection that causes a widespread, fine pink-red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch Click on the links above for more information on these conditions. You should see your GP if you have persistent or severe symptoms of a strep A infection, as they may recommend a short course of antibiotics. Most people with a minor strep A infection will make a full recovery and experience no long-term problems, although there is a very small risk the infection could spread further into the body or lead to complications such as rheumatic fever if left untreated. Invasive strep A infections In rare cases, strep A bacteria can penetrate deeper inside the tissues and organs of the body, and become what's known as an invasive infection. These infections are much rarer and usually affect certain groups of people, including babies, elderly people, people with diabetes, and people with weak immune systems (for example, because of cancer treatment or HIV). Examples of invasive infections include: pneumonia \u2013 an infection of the lungs that causes persistent coughing, breathing difficulties and chest pain sepsis \u2013 an infection of the blood that causes a fever, rapid heartbeat and rapid breathing meningitis \u2013 an infection of the protective outer layer of the brain that causes a severe headache, vomiting, stiff neck, sensitivity to light and a distinctive blotchy red rash toxic shock syndrome \u2013 where bacteria release toxins into the blood, which can cause a sudden high fever, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, fainting, dizziness and confusion necrotising fasciitis \u2013 an infection of the deeper layers of the skin, fat and covering of the muscle (fascia), which can cause severe pain, swelling and redness of the affected area that can spread very quickly Click on the links above for more information on these conditions. You should seek immediate medical advice if you think you may have an invasive strep A infection, as you will need to be treated with antibiotics as soon as possible. Although pneumonia is sometimes relatively mild, the overall outlook for more serious invasive strep A infections is poor. It's estimated up to one in every four people who develop an invasive strep A infection will die from it. Group B strep Group B strep (strep B) usually live harmlessly inside the digestive system and in the vagina. Strep B can sometimes cause urinary tract infections (UTIs), skin infections, bone infections, blood infections and pneumonia, particularly in vulnerable people, such as the elderly and those with diabetes. Strep B in pregnancy It's estimated around one in every four pregnant women have strep B bacteria in their vagina or digestive system. The bacteria can sometimes be passed on to the baby through the amniotic fluid (a clear liquid that surrounds and protects the unborn baby in the womb) or as the baby passes through the birth canal during labour. Most babies exposed to strep B will be unaffected, but in around 1 in every 2,000 cases they can become infected. A strep B infection during pregnancy can also cause miscarriage or stillbirth, but this is rare. Strep B in newborn babies As newborn babies have a poorly developed immune system, strep B bacteria can quickly spread through their body, causing serious infections such as meningitis and pneumonia. The symptoms of a strep B infection in a newborn baby usually develop within the first few hours or days of giving birth, and include: being floppy and unresponsive poor feeding grunting when breathing irritability an unusually high or low temperature unusually fast or slow breathing an unusually fast or slow heart rate In some cases, a baby can pick up a strep B infection a few weeks or months after birth. It's not known exactly why this happens, but it's not related to infection during birth. Symptoms of a late-onset group B strep infection can include a fever, poor feeding, vomiting and reduced consciousness. You should seek immediate medical advice if you think your baby may have a group B strep infection. Preventing and treating strep B infections in babies It's possible to reduce the chances of a baby becoming infected with strep B by identifying cases where there is a risk of the bacteria being passed from a mother to their child and giving the mother antibiotics directly into a vein (intravenously) during labour. Known risk factors that may mean you need intravenous antibiotics during labour include: you have previously given birth to a baby with a strep B infection strep B is found in your urine during tests carried out for other purposes strep B is found during vaginal and rectal swabs carried out for other purposes you have a fever during labour you go into labour prematurely (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) If your baby develops symptoms of a strep B infection after they're born, they will have tests to confirm the diagnosis and will be given intravenous antibiotics as soon as possible. Most babies who become infected can be treated successfully and will make a full recovery, although there is chance they could die as a result of complications such as meningitis. Some babies who survive are left with permanent problems, such as hearing loss, vision loss, and problems with memory and concentration.

Coping with stress Media last reviewed: 12\/05\/2016 Next review due: 12\/05\/2018 According to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), in 2014\/15, 440,000 people in the UK reported work-related stress at a level they believed was making them ill. That's 40% of all work-related illness. Psychological problems, including stress, anxiety and depression, are behind one in five visits to a GP. Some pressure at work can be motivating, but when it becomes excessive it can eventually lead to work-related stress. Stress is \u201Cthe adverse reaction people have to excessive pressures and demands placed on them\u201D, according to the HSE. Stress symptoms include a pounding heart or palpitations, a dry mouth, headaches, odd aches and pains and loss of appetite for food and sex. What causes work stress? The main reasons given for work stress include work pressure, lack of support from managers and work-related violence and bullying. Stress management advice Top 10 stress-busters Relaxation tips for stress Good time management The way you deal with stress can lead to unhealthy behaviours, such as smoking and drinking too much, which might increase your risk of heart disease. How to manage work stress Good stress management in the workplace is critical to your overall health. Life coach Suzy Greaves says one of the key skills to managing workplace stress is knowing how to say no. \"I\u2019m constantly challenging clients who say they have no choice but to overwork,\" she says. \"I coach people to become empowered and believe they have a choice.\" She explains that saying yes can win you brownie points in the short term, but if you take on too much and fail to deliver, it can be a disastrous long-term strategy. \"Have confidence in your \u2018no\u2019 when you think it's the right decision, even though it may not be the most popular one,\" she says. \"In the long term, your ability to say no will be one of your most valuable attributes.\" Learn to speak out Health and Safety Executive Management Standards: learn about the key workplace stressors Tools to help manage work-related stress Greaves says you can prevent exhaustion by knowing how much work you can take on. By taking on too much, you could end up doing nothing well. Calculate how long you'll need to deal with your current workload so that you can see if you have any extra capacity. \u201CIf you\u2019re extremely busy and your boss asks you to do more, you can say no. Outline your reasons in a specific, measurable way, but always offer a solution.\u201D Spot the signs of work stress Learn to recognise the physical effects of stress and do something about it before it makes you really ill. Beware of work stress spilling over into other areas of your life. Whatever the source of your stress, speak to your manager or someone in your organisation that you feel comfortable talking to. Or get outside help. Employers have a duty to ensure the health, safety and welfare of their employees. This comes under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. They're also required to conduct risk assessments for work-related stress. If the problem is not work-related, they may be able to support you in some way or help to take some pressure off you at work while you resolve the stress in your personal life. Who else can help with work stress? The HSE supports anyone who is responsible for tackling work-related stress in an organisation. That might be the person who has responsibility for human resources, a health and safety officer, trade union representatives or line managers. The HSE believes good management practices can help reduce work-related stress. It offers a management standards approach to help employers take sensible and practical steps to minimise stress in the workplace. Your GP can also help. Doctors aren't experts in employment law, but they can help you analyse the situation and refer you to more specialised help if necessary.

It is a common problem and is thought to affect millions of people worldwide. It's not clear exactly how many people are affected, but it's estimated that between 3 and 6 million people in the UK may have some degree of urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence affects both men and women, but it tends to be more common in women overall. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of urinary incontinence depend on the type you have. There are several types of urinary incontinence, but the most common are: stress incontinence \u2013 when urine leaks out at times when your bladder is under pressure, for example when you cough or laugh urge incontinence \u2013 when urine leaks as you feel a sudden, intense urge to pass urine, or soon afterwards It is also possible to have a mixture of both stress and urge urinary incontinence. Read more about the symptoms of urinary incontinence. What causes urinary incontinence? The causes of urinary incontinence depend on the type. Stress incontinence is usually the result of the weakening or damaging of the muscles used to prevent urination, such as the pelvic floor muscles and the urethral sphincter. Urge incontinence is usually the result of overactivity of the detrusor muscles, which control the bladder. Certain things can increase the chances of urinary incontinence developing, including: pregnancy and vaginal birth obesity a family history of incontinence increasing age \u2013 although incontinence is not an inevitable part of ageing Read more about the causes of urinary incontinence. Seeking medical advice Although you may feel embarrassed talking to someone about your symptoms, it's a good idea to see your GP if you have any type of urinary incontinence as this can be the first step towards finding a way to effectively manage the problem. Urinary incontinence can usually be diagnosed after a consultation with your GP, who will ask about your symptoms and may carry out a pelvic examination (in women) or rectal examination (in men). Your GP may also suggest you keep a diary in which you note how much fluid you drink and how often you have to urinate. Read more about diagnosing urinary incontinence. How urinary incontinence is treated Initially, your GP may suggest some simple measures to see if they help improve your symptoms. These may include: lifestyle changes, such as losing weight and cutting down on caffeine and alcohol pelvic floor exercises (exercising your pelvic floor muscles by squeezing them) taught by a specialist  bladder training (where you learn ways to help you can wait longer between needing to urinate and passing urine) guided by a specialist You may also benefit from the use of incontinence products, such as absorbent pads and hand-held urinals (urine collection bottles). If you are still unable to manage your symptoms, medication may be recommended.  Surgery may also be considered. The specific procedures suitable for you will depend on the type of incontinence you have. Surgical treatments for stress incontinence, such as tape or sling procedures, are used to reduce pressure on the bladder, or strengthen the muscles that control urination. Operations to treat urge incontinence include enlarging the bladder or implanting a device that stimulates the nerve that controls the detrusor muscles. Read more about non-surgical treatments for urinary incontinence and surgery and procedures for urinary incontinence. Preventing urinary incontinence It is not always possible to prevent urinary incontinence, but there are some steps you can take that may help reduce the chance of it developing, such as: controlling your weight avoiding or cutting down on alcohol keeping fit \u2013 in particular, ensuring that your pelvic floor muscles are strong Read more about preventing urinary incontinence.

Media last reviewed: 07\/05\/2015 Next review due: 07\/05\/2017 How we pass urine Urine passes from the kidneys through tubes called ureters to the bladder, where it is stored. The bladder is supported by pelvic floor muscles. Some of this muscle wraps around the urethra \u2013 the tube that runs from the bladder to outside the body \u2013 to help keep it closed until you need to pass urine. Once the bladder is full, a signal is sent to the brain that you need to pass urine. When you are ready, the brain tells the pelvic floor muscles to relax and open the urethra. The muscles around the bladder contract and push the urine out. A problem in any part of this process can result in urinary incontinence.

Stretch marks are often red or purple to start with, before gradually fading to a silvery-white colour. They're usually long and thin. This topic covers: Where stretch marks occur When stretch marks occur How stretch marks develop What causes stretch marks? Treating stretch marks Preventing stretch marks Where stretch marks occur Stretch marks can occur anywhere where the skin has been stretched, but they usually affect areas where fat is stored, such as the: tummy (abdomen) breasts upper arms buttocks thighs shoulders (in bodybuilders) Sometimes, particularly in teenage boys, stretch marks can develop on the back, overlying the spine horizontally (like the rungs on a ladder). Stretch marks caused by Cushing's syndrome (where the blood contains high levels of a hormone called cortisol, see below) tend to be wider and larger, and can also appear on the face. When stretch marks occur Stretch marks often occur: during pregnancy after rapid weight gain during puberty if you have a family history of stretch marks if you have an underlying health condition or a syndrome, such as Cushing's syndrome or Marfan syndrome after the prolonged or inappropriate use of corticosteroid medication   These are discussed in more detail below. Pregnancy Stretch marks often occur during the later stages of pregnancy, affecting about eight out of 10 pregnant women. Whether or not you'll get stretch marks depends on your skin type and how elastic it is. During pregnancy, hormones are produced that soften the ligaments in your pelvis so they're more flexible when you give birth. Ligaments are strong bands of tissue that connect joints. However, the hormones also soften the fibres in your skin, making it prone to stretch marks. As your baby grows and your skin stretches, you may get stretch marks on your tummy. You may also develop them on your thighs and breasts as they get bigger. Stretch marks usually fade and become less noticeable after childbirth, but they don't always disappear completely. Rapid weight gain You may get stretch marks if you put on a lot of weight over a short period of time. They sometimes remain even after losing weight, but should eventually fade. Regular dieting can cause stretch marks as your weight goes up and down. If you need to lose weight, lose it slowly and steadily so that your skin isn't put under strain. Read more about how to lose weight safely. Bodybuilders and athletes can also get stretch marks as their muscles increase in size. Puberty During puberty, the body often develops very quickly in growth spurts. Boys may get stretch marks on their shoulders and back, and girls may get them on their hips, thighs and breasts. Family history If you have a close relative with stretch marks, such as your mother, you're more likely to develop them yourself. Although stretch marks can affect both male and female family members, they're more common in women. Underlying health conditions Stretch marks can sometimes be related to rare conditions or syndromes, such as Cushing's syndrome and Marfan syndrome. Cushing's syndrome occurs when the body overproduces the hormone cortisol, which is thought to cause stretch marks. Marfan syndrome is caused by a faulty gene that weakens the body's skin and connective tissues, reducing their elasticity (ability to stretch). This means the skin isn't as resistant to stretch marks as it should be. In Marfan syndrome, stretch marks can occur on the shoulders, hips and lower back. Corticosteroids In rare cases, stretch marks can develop after prolonged or inappropriate use of corticosteroids, such as creams or lotions used to treat skin conditions, including eczema. Corticosteroids work in a similar way to the hormone cortisol. They can help ease inflammatory skin conditions but, like cortisol, they can also reduce the amount of collagen in your skin. Collagen is a protein that helps keep your skin stretchy. The less collagen there is in your skin, the more likely you are to develop stretch marks. When using a corticosteroid cream or lotion, follow the manufacturer's instructions about how and where to apply it. The face, groin and armpits are particularly sensitive areas. Ask your GP or pharmacist for advice if you're unsure. How stretch marks develop Before stretch marks appear, the affected skin will become thin, flattened and pink, and may feel itchy. The stretch marks themselves appear as red or purple streaks or lines, but can be pink, reddish-brown or dark brown, depending on your skin colour. They can occur in patches of parallel lines on your body and often appear \"scar-like\". To start with, the lines will be slightly raised and may feel wrinkly, before eventually flattening out. As the lines become flatter, they'll start to fade and change to a white or silvery colour. They'll usually become less noticeable over time, although this process can sometimes take years. What causes stretch marks? Stretch marks are caused when the skin rapidly stretches as a result of sudden growth or weight gain. The stretching causes the middle layer of skin (dermis) to tear, allowing the deeper skin layers to show through, forming stretch marks. The dermis contains strong, inter-connected fibres that allow your skin to stretch as your body grows. However, rapid growth can cause the skin to over-stretch and break the fibres. The tears in the dermis allow the blood vessels below to show through, which is why stretch marks are often red or purple when they first appear. When the blood vessels eventually contract (get smaller), the pale-coloured fat underneath your skin will be visible, and your stretch marks will change to a silvery-white colour. Treating stretch marks Most stretch marks aren't particularly noticeable and will fade over time. If you have unsightly stretch marks, or if they affect a large area of your body, there are a few treatment options available. However, there isn't much evidence to show that these treatments work. Camouflage Cosmetic camouflage (make-up) is available over-the-counter at pharmacies. It can be used for small areas of skin affected by stretch marks. Some types are waterproof and can last two to three days. Creams, gels and lotions The manufacturers of creams, gels and lotions often claim that they can remove stretch marks. However, it's unlikely they can prevent stretch marks occurring, or make them fade any more than they will over time. These products are essentially skin moisturisers and are available from pharmacies, supermarkets, and health and beauty shops. They should usually be applied when your stretch marks are still red or purple. Laser therapy Laser therapy can't completely remove stretch marks, but it may help fade them and make them less noticeable. Several different types of laser therapy are used to treat stretch marks. Pulsed dye laser treatment is one type of laser treatment available. It's painless and can be used at an early stage, while your stretch marks are still red or purple. The energy from the laser is absorbed by the blood vessels underneath your stretch marks. The blood vessels collapse and the red or purple colour either disappears completely or turns white.  Laser therapy for stretch marks isn't available on the NHS and it's usually expensive. You'll probably need a few treatments to obtain visible results. The exact number will depend on your skin colour and type. Cosmetic surgery Cosmetic surgery for stretch marks is expensive and rarely recommended. If you have stretch marks on your abdomen and a large amount of loose skin, it may be possible to have an abdominoplasty (tummy tuck). This is a type of cosmetic surgery that removes excess fat and skin from your abdomen, and also gets rid of stretch marks below your belly button. As this surgery is carried out for cosmetic reasons (to improve appearance), it isn't available on the NHS. It also carries a number of associated risks and can cause considerable scarring. Preventing stretch marks Stretch marks can't always be prevented \u2013 for example, they often occur during pregnancy. However, there are some things you can do to help lower your chances of getting stretch marks. Weight and diet Stretch marks are often caused by gaining weight rapidly over a short period of time. Avoiding rapid weight gain and weight loss (\"yo-yo dieting\") can help prevent stretch marks. If you need to lose weight, you should do it slowly by eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly. You shouldn't lose more than 0.5kg (1lb) a week. Read more about how to lose weight safely. It's important to eat a healthy, balanced diet that's rich in vitamins and minerals, particularly vitamin E, vitamin C, and the minerals zinc and silicon. These vitamins and minerals will help keep your skin healthy. A balanced diet will provide all the vitamins and minerals your body needs. Dietary supplements aren't needed to prevent stretch marks. Body mass index (BMI) is a measure most people can use to check whether their weight is healthy in relation to their height and build. For most adults, a BMI of 18.5 to 25 is considered healthy. You can use the BMI healthy weight calculator to find out whether you're overweight. During pregnancy Stretch marks during pregnancy (striae gravidarum) are usually caused by hormonal changes that affect your skin. Gaining pregnancy weight steadily may help minimise the effect of stretch marks. During pregnancy, it's normal to put on weight over a relatively short period of time. However, it's a myth that you need to \"eat for two\", even if you're expecting twins or triplets. If you're pregnant you don't need to go on a special diet, but you should eat a variety of foods every day to get the right balance of nutrients for you and your baby. Your diet should be rich in wholewheat carbohydrates, such as bread and pasta, as well as fruit and vegetables. Read more about diet during pregnancy and being overweight and pregnant. Emotional effects of stretch marks Some people find having stretch marks distressing. See your GP if you have stretch marks and you're depressed, or they're affecting your daily activities. Organisations, such as Changing Faces and the British Association of Skin Camouflage may also be useful sources of help and support.

However, there are some things you can do to help lower your chances of getting stretch marks. Weight and diet Stretch marks are often caused by gaining weight rapidly over a short period of time. Avoiding rapid weight gain and weight loss (\"yo-yo dieting\") can help prevent stretch marks. If you need to lose weight, you should do it slowly by eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly. You shouldn't lose more than 0.5kg (1lb) a week. Read more about how to lose weight safely. It's important to eat a healthy, balanced diet that's rich in vitamins and minerals, particularly vitamin E, vitamin C, and the minerals zinc and silicon. These vitamins and minerals will help keep your skin healthy. A balanced diet will provide all the vitamins and minerals your body needs. Dietary supplements aren't needed to prevent stretch marks. Body mass index (BMI) is a measure most people can use to check whether their weight is healthy in relation to their height and build. For most adults, a BMI of 18.5 to 25 is considered healthy. You can use the BMI healthy weight calculator to find out whether you're overweight. During pregnancy Stretch marks during pregnancy (striae gravidarum) are usually caused by hormonal changes that affect your skin. Gaining pregnancy weight steadily may help minimise the effect of stretch marks. During pregnancy, it's normal to put on weight over a relatively short period of time. However, it's a myth that you need to \"eat for two\", even if you're expecting twins or triplets. If you're pregnant you don't need to go on a special diet, but you should eat a variety of foods every day to get the right balance of nutrients for you and your baby. Your diet should be rich in wholewheat carbohydrates, such as bread and pasta, as well as fruit and vegetables. Read more about diet during pregnancy and being overweight and pregnant. Emotional effects of stretch marks Some people find having stretch marks distressing. See your GP if you have stretch marks and you're depressed, or they're affecting your daily activities. Organisations, such as Changing Faces and the British Association of Skin Camouflage may also be useful sources of help and support.

Strokes are a medical emergency and urgent treatment is essential because the sooner a person receives treatment for a stroke, the less damage is likely to happen. If you suspect that you or someone else is having a stroke, phone 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Signs and symptoms The main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the word FAST: Face-Arms-Speech-Time. Face \u2013 the face may have dropped on one side, the person may not be able to smile or their mouth or eye may have dropped. Arms \u2013 the person with suspected stroke may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm. Speech \u2013 their speech may be slurred or garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake. Time \u2013 it is time to dial 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms. Read more about the symptoms of a stroke. Why do strokes happen? Like all organs, the brain needs the oxygen and nutrients provided by blood to function properly. If the supply of blood is restricted or stopped, brain cells begin to die. This can lead to brain injury, disability and possibly death. There are two main causes of strokes: ischaemic \u2013 where the blood supply is stopped due to a blood clot (this accounts for 85% of all cases) haemorrhagic \u2013 where a weakened blood vessel supplying the brain bursts There is also a related condition known as a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), where the supply of blood to the brain is temporarily interrupted, causing a \"mini-stroke\" often lasting between 30 minutes and several hours. TIAs should be treated seriously as they are often a warning sign that you are at risk of having a full stroke in the near future. Read more about the causes of strokes. Who is at risk? In the UK, strokes are a major health problem. Every year, around 110,000 people have a stroke in England and it is the third largest cause of death, after heart disease and cancer. The brain injuries caused by strokes are a major cause of adult disability in the UK. Older people are most at risk of having strokes, although they can happen at any age \u2013 including in children. If you are south Asian, African or Caribbean, your risk of stroke is higher. This is partly because of a predisposition (a natural tendency) to developing high blood pressure (hypertension), which can lead to strokes. Smoking, being overweight, lack of exercise and a poor diet are also risk factors for stroke, as are high cholesterol, atrial fibrillation and diabetes. How strokes are treated Treatment depends on the type of stroke you have, including which part of the brain was affected and what caused it. Most often, strokes are treated with medication. This generally includes medicines to prevent and remove blood clots, reduce blood pressure and reduce cholesterol levels. In some cases, surgery may be required to treat brain swelling and reduce the risk of further bleeding in cases of haemorrhagic strokes. Read more about diagnosing strokes and treating strokes. Life after a stroke Around one in every four people who has a stroke will die, and those who do survive are often left with long-term problems resulting from the injury to their brain. Some people need to have a long period of rehabilitation before they can recover their former independence, while many will never fully recover and will need support adjusting to living with the effects of their stroke. Local authorities should provide free \"reablement services\" for anyone assessed as needing them. These services help the person recovering from a stroke to learn or relearn the skills necessary for independent daily living at home. Read more about the reablement services you may be entitled to. Around half the people who have a stroke will be dependent on some form of care for help with their daily activities. For example, a care worker could come to the person's home to help with washing and dressing, or even just to provide companionship. Read more about care services in your home. A team of specialists are also available to help, including physiotherapists, psychologists, occupational therapists, speech therapists and specialist nurses and doctors. Read more about recovering from a stroke. If you're recovering from a stroke or caring for someone who is, it may be useful to read your guide to care and support. This is written for people with care and support needs, as well as their carers and relatives. Can strokes be prevented? You can significantly reduce your risk of having a stroke through a healthy lifestyle, such as eating a healthy diet, taking regular exercise, drinking alcohol in moderation and not smoking. Lowering high blood pressure and cholesterol levels with medication also lowers the risk of stroke substantially, as does taking anticoagulant medication if you have an irregular heartbeat due to a condition called atrial fibrillation. If you have had a stroke or TIA in the past, these measures are particularly important because your risk of having another stroke in the future is greatly increased.

The disruption in blood supply results in a lack of oxygen to the brain. This can cause sudden symptoms similar to those of a stroke, such as speech and visual disturbance, and numbness or weakness in the face, arms and legs. However, a TIA does not last as long as a stroke. The effects often only last for a few minutes or hours and fully resolve within 24 hours. Signs and symptoms The main symptoms of a TIA can be remembered with the word FAST: Face-Arms-Speech-Time. Face \u2013 the face may have dropped on one side, the person may not be able to smile, or their mouth or eye may have dropped. Arms \u2013 the person with suspected stroke may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm. Speech \u2013 their speech may be slurred or garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all, despite appearing to be awake. Time \u2013 it is time to dial 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms. Read more about the symptoms of a TIA. Seeking medical advice In the early stages of a TIA, it's not possible to tell whether you are having a TIA or a full stroke, so it's important to phone 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Even if the symptoms disappear while you are waiting for the ambulance to arrive, an assessment in hospital should still be carried out. A TIA is a warning that you are at risk of having a full stroke in the near future, and an assessment can help doctors to determine the best way to reduce the chances of this happening. If you think you may have had a TIA previously, but the symptoms have since passed and you didn't seek medical advice at the time, you should make an urgent appointment with your GP so they can determine whether to refer you for a hospital assessment. Read more about diagnosing a TIA. What causes TIAs? During a TIA, one of the blood vessels that supply your brain with oxygen-rich blood becomes blocked. This blockage is usually caused by a blood clot that has formed elsewhere in your body and travelled to the blood vessels supplying the brain, although it can also be caused by pieces of fatty material or air bubbles. Certain things can increase your chances of having a TIA, including: smoking having high blood pressure (hypertension) being obese having high cholesterol levels regularly drinking an excessive amount of alcohol having atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heartbeat) having diabetes People over 60 years of age, and people of Asian, African or Caribbean descent are also at a higher risk of having a TIA. Read more about the causes of TIA. How TIAs are treated Although the symptoms of a TIA resolve in a few minutes or hours, you will need treatment to help prevent another TIA or a full stroke happening in the future. Your treatment will depend on your individual circumstances, such as your age and medical history. You are likely to be given advice about lifestyle changes you can make to reduce your stroke risk (see below), in addition to being offered medication to treat the underlying cause of your TIA. In some cases, surgery may be needed to unblock the carotid arteries (the main blood vessels that supply the brain with blood). Read more about treating a TIA. Preventing TIAs A TIA is often a sign that another one may follow and you are at a high risk of having a full, life-threatening stroke in the near future. Regardless of whether or not you have had a TIA or stroke in the past, there are a number of ways you can lower your risk of having either in the future. These include: maintaining a healthy weight eating healthily taking regular exercise limiting your alcohol consumption not smoking Read more about how lifestyle factors can help to prevent a TIA.

Stammering is characterised by: the repetition of sounds or syllables \u2013 such as saying \u2018mu-mu-mu-mummy\u2019 prolonging sounds \u2013 for example 'mmmmmmummy' pausing or 'blocking' \u2013 when a word gets stuck or doesn't come out at all It usually occurs at the beginning of speech, and people will often avoid certain words or speaking situations to try to hide it. Stammering varies in severity from person to person. A person might find that they have periods of stammering followed by times when they speak relatively fluently. Read more about the signs of stammering. Types of stammering There are two main types of stammer: Developmental stammering is the most common type of stammering that many people are familiar with. It develops during childhood as a child is first learning how to speak. Acquired or late-onset stammering can occur in older children and adults as the result of a severe head injury, stroke or a progressive neurological disease (disease affecting the nervous system). It can also be caused by certain drugs or medication, or psychological or emotional trauma. The rest of this article will focus on developmental stammering. What causes stammering? The exact cause of developmental stammering is still unclear, although it is largely thought to be the result of the parts of the brain involved in speech being 'wired' differently. Studies have shown differences in the structure and functioning of the brain of people who stammer compared with most other people. In young children, the wiring of the brain is still developing, which may be why many children eventually 'grow out' of stammering and why it is usually easier to treat children while they are still young. Genes are also thought to play a role in many cases of stammering, as around two in every three people who stammer have a family history of the condition. This suggests that the genes a child inherits from their parents might make them more likely to develop a stammer. Research has identified several genes that may contribute to stammering that runs in families, although exactly how these genes lead to the condition is currently unknown. Who is affected Stammering is common in young children. Estimates for developmental stammering vary, but it is often suggested that around one in 20 children will experience a phase of non-fluent speech. In around three in every four cases affecting young children, stammering will resolve over time with or without treatment. However, it is difficult to predict when this will happen and some children will require treatment to prevent the problem persisting into adulthood. The condition is more likely to persist in males than females, which is why there are around four times as many men as women with a stammer. The reason for this is unclear. It is estimated that one in every 100 adults has a stammer. Getting help If you have any concerns about your child's speech and language development, seek advice. Treatment is often highly successful in resolving stammers in pre-school age children, especially if it is received as soon as possible, so early referral to a specialist is key. A good person to contact first may be your GP, who can discuss your concerns with you and refer you to a speech and language therapist (SLT) for an assessment if necessary. Alternatively, many speech and language services accept self-referrals from patients and parents. You can contact the British Stammering Association helpline on 0845 603 2001 for advice about seeking help and information about the services available in your area. It may also be worth seeking advice from your GP or an SLT if you are an adult with a stammer and it is having a significant impact on your social and work life. How stammering is treated There are many different speech and language therapy approaches that can help people to improve fluency and communication skills in people who stammer. A therapist will work with you to come up with a suitable plan tailored to your or your child's individual circumstances. This may involve: working to create an environment in which a child feels more relaxed and confident about their use of language working on feelings associated with stammering, such as fear and anxiety strategies to improve fluency and communication skills Electronic \u2018anti-stammering\u2019 devices are also available and can be helpful for some people. These are designed to help people control their speech by giving them sound feedback, although they are not generally available on the NHS. Read more about treating stammering.

The eye may also be watery and the eye or eyelid red. A stye \u2013 also called a hordeolum \u2013 usually only affects one eye, although it's possible to have styes in both eyes or to have more than one stye in the same eye. Your vision shouldn't be affected. Styes often get better without treatment, particularly after they burst and release pus. Don't try to burst the stye yourself. Go to see your GP if you have a stye that's very painful (see below). This topic covers: Types of stye What causes a stye? Treating a stye When to see your GP Complications of a stye Types of stye There are two types of stye: external stye (external hordeolum) \u2013 a swelling that develops along the edge of your eyelid; it may turn into a yellow pus-filled spot that's painful to touch internal stye (internal hordeolum) \u2013 a swelling that develops on the inside of your eyelid; it's usually more painful than an external stye What causes a stye? Styes are usually caused by a staphylococcal infection. Staphylococcus bacteria often live on the skin without causing any harm. External styes A stye on the outside of your eyelid may be caused by an infection of: an eyelash follicle \u2013 these are small holes in your skin that individual eyelashes grow out of the sebaceous (Zeis) gland \u2013 this gland is attached to the eyelash follicle and produces an oily substance called sebum, which lubricates the eyelash to prevent it drying out the apocrine (Moll) gland \u2013 this sweat gland empties into the eyelash follicle and helps prevent the eye drying out Internal styes Internal styes are caused by an infection of the meibomian gland. These glands are found on the eyelids and produce an oily liquid, which makes up part of the tear film that covers your eye. Blepharitis A stye can sometimes be a complication of blepharitis, where the eyelids become inflamed (red and swollen). This can result in symptoms such as: burning or sore eyes crusty eyelashes itchy eyelids Blepharitis can be caused by a bacterial infection, or it can be a complication of rosacea (a skin condition that mainly affects the face). Treating a stye Most styes get better without treatment within one to three weeks. In the meantime, the treatments below should help ease your symptoms. Warm compress A warm compress is a cloth or flannel warmed with hot water that can be held against the affected eye. Be careful not to use water that's too hot, particularly on children. You should: hold the warm compress over the affected eye for five to 10 minutes repeat this three or four times a day until the stye clears up or releases some pus The warmth of the compress will encourage the stye to release any pus, which will drain away. After this, your symptoms should quickly improve. You should also keep the area around your eye clean and free from crusting. Painkillers If your stye is very painful, over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, may help ease the pain. Always read the manufacturer's instructions to ensure the medication is suitable for you and that you take the correct dose. Don't give aspirin to children under 16 years of age. Other eye conditions If you have another eye condition that's making your stye worse, your GP may prescribe separate medication for this or recommend a different course of treatment. For example, if you have: conjunctivitis \u2013 antibiotics may be prescribed blepharitis \u2013 your GP may recommend eye hygiene measures, such as using a cotton bud to clean the rim of your eyelids Antibiotics aren't recommended for treating styes because there's little evidence they're effective, and styes usually get better on their own. However, antibiotics may be used to treat complications of styes, such as chalazions (meibomian cysts). When to see your GP See your GP if you have an external stye (on the outside of your eyelid) that's very painful. Your GP may: remove the eyelash closest to the stye if the stye is caused by an infected eyelash follicle use a very thin, clean needle to make an incision in the stye and drain away the pus Don't try to remove the eyelash or burst the stye yourself. Referral Your GP may refer you to an ophthalmologist (a specialist in diagnosing and treating eye conditions) if: your stye doesn't improve after using the above treatments you have an internal stye (on the inside of your eyelid) that's particularly large or painful The ophthalmologist may make an incision in the stye and drain out any pus. Complications of a stye Styes can sometimes cause complications, but they're rarely serious. Complications can include: a chalazion (meibomian cyst) \u2013 which can develop if you've had a stye for a long time and a gland in your eyelid becomes blocked preseptal cellulitis \u2013 an infection of the tissues around your eye Chalazion (meibomian cyst) Chalazions are usually painless unless they become infected. If they do, you may need antibiotics. Applying a warm compress (see above) to the cyst should help bring it down, although most cysts disappear by themselves. If the cyst doesn't disappear, it can be surgically removed under local anaesthetic (where the affected area is numbed). Preseptal cellulitis If the infection that caused your stye spreads to the tissues around your eye it can cause preseptal cellulitis. Preseptal cellulitis, also known as periorbital cellulitis, is inflammation in the layers of skin around the eye. It can make your eyelids red and swollen and can be treated with antibiotics.

It's a very serious condition and can be fatal. Subarachnoid haemorrhages account for around 1 in every 20 strokes in the UK. Symptoms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage There are usually no warning signs but a subarachnoid haemorrhage sometimes happens during physical effort or straining \u2013 such as coughing, going to the toilet, lifting something heavy or having sex. The main symptoms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage include: a sudden agonising headache \u2013 which is often described as being similar to a sudden hit on the head, resulting in a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before a stiff neck feeling and being sick sensitivity to light (photophobia) blurred or double vision stroke-like symptoms \u2013 such as slurred speech and weakness on one side of the body loss of consciousness or convulsions (uncontrollable shaking) A subarachnoid haemorrhage is a medical emergency. Dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you, or someone in your care, has these symptoms. How a subarachnoid haemorrhage is treated A person with a suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage needs a computerised tomography (CT) scan in hospital to check for signs of bleeding around the brain. If a diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage is confirmed or strongly suspected, you're likely to be transferred to a specialist neurosciences unit. Medication will usually be given to help prevent short-term complications (see below) and a procedure to repair the source of the bleeding may be carried out. Read more about:  diagnosing a subarachnoid haemorrhage treating a subarachnoid haemorrhage What causes subarachnoid haemorrhages? The majority of subarachnoid haemorrhages are caused by a brain aneurysm bursting. A brain aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel, caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall. It's not known exactly why brain aneurysms develop in some people. However, certain risk factors have been identified, including: smoking high blood pressure excessive alcohol consumption Less common causes of subarachnoid haemorrhages include having abnormally developed blood vessels and inflammation of blood vessels in the brain. Severe head injuries often cause subarachnoid bleeding, but this is a separate problem known as a \"traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage\". Read more about the causes of subarachnoid haemorrhages. Who's affected? Between April 2013 and April 2014, more than 6,000 people were admitted to hospitals in England with a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Subarachnoid haemorrhages can happen at any age but they're most common in people aged between 45 and 70. Slightly more women are affected than men. Subarachnoid haemorrhages are also more common in black people compared to other ethnic groups. This could be because black people are more likely to have high blood pressure. Read more about black health issues. Reducing your risk It's not always possible to prevent a subarachnoid haemorrhage, but there are some things you can do to reduce your risk. The three most effective steps you can take to reduce your chances of having a subarachnoid haemorrhage are: stop smoking \u2013 your GP can refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking Service for help and advice or you can call the NHS Smoking Helpline on 0300 123 1044 moderate your alcohol consumption take steps to prevent high blood pressure \u2013 such as regular exercise, eating a healthy diet and losing weight if you're overweight Possible complications A subarachnoid haemorrhage can cause both short and long-term complications. Serious short-term complications can include further bleeding at the site of any aneurysm and brain damage caused by a reduction in blood supply to the brain. Long-term complications include: epilepsy \u2013 where a person has repeated seizures (fits) problems with certain mental functions, such as memory, planning and concentration changes in mood, such as depression Read more about the complications of a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Outlook Although the outlook for subarachnoid haemorrhage has improved in the last few decades, around half of all cases are fatal, and people who survive can be left with long-term problems. Recovering after a subarachnoid haemorrhage can also be a slow and frustrating process, and it's common to have problems such as: extreme tiredness headaches problems sleeping Read more about recovering from a subarachnoid haemorrhage.

It's usually seen in women, on the thighs and lower legs. There are many types of panniculitis \u2013 with different causes \u2013 but the condition generally causes the skin to feel hard and to develop painful red lumps (nodules) or patches (plaques), making it look darker in places. Panniculitis usually affects the shins and calves, but may spread to the thighs, forearms and chest. It tends to clear up within six weeks, fading like a bruise, usually without scarring. When the inflammation has settled, a depression in the skin may be left, which can be temporary or permanent. Many people get recurring bouts of panniculitis. Other symptoms As well as skin symptoms, panniculitis may also be associated with: fever fatigue weight loss nausea and vomiting joint pain What are the causes? There are a wide range of possible causes of panniculitis, although often the cause is not known. Common causes include: an infection \u2013 usually a viral or bacterial infection, but sometimes tuberculosis an inflammatory disease such as Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis some medicines, including the oral contraceptive pill or sulphonamides (a group of antibiotics) sarcoidosis \u2013 a rare disease that causes body cells to form into clumps, called granulomas, in the lungs and skin leukaemia (cancer of the white blood cells) or lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system, part of your immune system) Some cases of panniculitis may be caused by the body's immune system mistakenly attacking the fat cells. Types of panniculitis The layer of fat underneath the skin is made of lobules (groups of fat cells) held together by connective tissue. Doctors sometimes classify the disease as either: \u2018mostly septal\u2019 \u2013 the inflammation mostly affects the connective tissue \u2018mostly lobular\u2019 \u2013 it mostly affects the fat lobules Some people will also have vasculitis, where the immune system attacks the body's blood vessels. If a blood vessel is inflamed, it can narrow or close off, this can limit, or even prevent, blood flow through the vessel and potentially damage organs. The most common type of panniculitis is erythema nodosum, which affects the shins. In about half of all cases of erythema nodosum, the cause is unknown. A similar form of the disease is Weber-Christian disease, also known as idiopathic lobular panniculitis (idiopathic means \u2018unknown cause\u2019). This most commonly affects the thighs and lower legs of women aged 30-60, and can also cause the non-skin symptoms mentioned above, such as fever and fatigue. Other types include: erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis), which usually affects the calves of young women and is often caused by tuberculosis cold panniculitis, which affects areas of skin exposed to the cold \u2013 for example, it can affect the cheeks and forehead of infants and children subcutaneous sarcoidosis, when the cause is the rare disease sarcoidosis A full list of all the different types of panniculitis can be found on DermNet NZ, which provides pictures and detailed information on the specific types. How is panniculitis treated? Doctors will aim to treat the underlying cause of the panniculitis, if known, and relieve some of the symptoms. While treatment is underway, you will be asked to ensure you get enough rest and to elevate the affected area when possible. Treatments will vary; for example, if panniculitis is triggered by medication, this medicine should be stopped \u2013 but don't stop taking any medication without first speaking to your GP. If the cause is a bacterial infection, you will be prescribed anti-inflammatory antibiotics, such as tetracycline, to clear the infection. If the cause is sarcoidosis, you may not need any medical treatment as the disease often goes away on its own with time (usually a couple of years). Often, simple lifestyle changes, over the counter painkillers, and support bandages are all that is needed to control any flare ups. Read more about managing sarcoidosis.  The following treatments may help to relieve symptoms: Joint pain and painful skin nodules can be relieved with anti-inflammatory painkillers (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. A solution of potassium iodide may help to relieve symptoms \u2013 this is thought to have an effect on white blood cells (read more about potassium iodide treatment for skin conditions). The inflammation may occasionally be treated with steroid cream, steroid tablets or injections, or immunosuppressants (drugs to weaken the immune system), if the immune system is responsible. If the condition is severe and the above treatments don't help, you may wish to consider surgical removal of particularly bad patches of skin. Your GP will refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) to discuss the pros and cons of surgery. Community content from HealthUnlocked Which painkiller?

It's usually caused by a head injury. Symptoms of a subdural haematoma can include: a headache that keeps getting worse feeling and being sick confusion personality changes, such as being unusually aggressive or having rapid mood swings feeling drowsy loss of consciousness The symptoms can develop soon after a severe head injury (acute subdural haematoma), or very occasionally a few days or weeks after a more minor head injury (subacute or chronic subdural haematoma). Read more about the symptoms of a subdural haematoma. When to seek medical advice You should always seek emergency medical treatment after a severe head injury. Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, or dial 999 to request an ambulance. If you develop the symptoms above any time after a minor head injury, you should also go to your nearest A&E department or call 999 for an ambulance as soon as possible. A subdural haematoma can be very serious and needs to be assessed as quickly as possible. Read more about diagnosing subdural haematomas. What causes subdural haematomas? A subdural haematoma occurs when a blood vessel in the space between the skull and the brain (the subdural space) is damaged. Blood escapes from the blood vessel, leading to the formation of a blood clot (haematoma) that places pressure on the brain and damages it. Head injuries that cause subdural haematomas are often severe, such as those from a car crash, fall or violent assault. However, minor bumps to the head can also lead to a subdural haematoma in a few cases. A minor head injury is more likely to lead to a subdural haematoma if you're over 60 years of age, taking blood-thinning medication such as warfarin, or have a history of alcohol misuse. Read more about the causes of a subdural haematoma. How subdural haematomas are treated Subdural haematomas usually need to be treated with surgery as soon as possible. The two most widely used surgical techniques for subdural haematomas are: craniotomy \u2013 a section of the skull is temporarily removed so the surgeon can access and remove the haematoma burr holes \u2013 a small hole is drilled into the skull and a tube is inserted through the hole to help drain the haematoma In a few cases, very small subdural haematomas may be carefully monitored first to see if they heal without having an operation. Read more about treating subdural haematomas. Outlook A subdural haematoma is a serious condition that carries a high risk of death, particularly in older people and those whose brain was severely damaged. Acute subdural haematomas are the most serious type because they're often associated with significant damage to the brain. Those who survive an acute subdural haematoma may take a long time to recover and may be left with physical and mental disabilities. The outlook is generally better for subacute and chronic haematomas. Most people who are fit enough to have surgery eventually make a full recovery. However, because many people with these types of haematoma are older, they may be too frail to have treatment. Read more about recovering from a subdural haematoma.

In the UK, just under 300 babies die suddenly and unexpectedly every year. This statistic may sound alarming, but SIDS is rare and the risk of your baby dying from it is low. Most deaths happen during the first six months of a baby\u2019s life. Infants born prematurely or with a low birthweight are at greater risk. SIDS also tends to be slightly more common in baby boys. SIDS usually occurs when a baby is asleep, although it can occasionally happen while they're awake. Parents can reduce the risk of SIDS by not smoking while pregnant or after the baby is born, and always placing the baby on their back when they sleep (see below). Find out how to stop smoking.  What causes SIDS? The exact cause of SIDS is unknown, but it's thought to be down to a combination of factors. Experts believe SIDS occurs at a particular stage in a baby\u2019s development, and that it affects babies who are vulnerable to certain environmental stresses. This vulnerability may be caused by being born prematurely or having a low birthweight, or because of other reasons not yet identified.  Environmental stresses could include tobacco smoke, getting tangled in bedding, a minor illness or a breathing obstruction. There's also an association between co-sleeping (sleeping with your baby on a bed, sofa or chair) and SIDS. Babies who die of SIDS are thought to have problems in the way they respond to these stresses and how they regulate their heart rate, breathing and temperature. Although the cause of SIDS isn't fully understood, there are a number of things you can do to reduce the risk. What can I do to help prevent SIDS? Below is a list of things you can do to help prevent SIDS. Do: Always place your baby on their back to sleep. Place your baby in the \"feet to foot\" position (with their feet touching the end of the cot, Moses basket, or pram). Keep your baby\u2019s head uncovered. Their blanket should be tucked in no higher than their shoulders. Let your baby sleep in a cot or Moses basket in the same room as you for the first six months. Use a mattress that's firm, flat, waterproof and in good condition. Breastfeed your baby (if you can). See Why breastfeed? for more information. Don't: Smoke during pregnancy or let anyone smoke in the same room as your baby (both before and after birth). Sleep on a bed, sofa or armchair with your baby. Share a bed with your baby if you or your partner smoke or take drugs, or if you've been drinking alcohol. Let your baby get too hot or too cold. A room temperature of 16-20C, with light bedding or a lightweight baby sleeping bag, will provide a comfortable sleeping environment for your baby. Read more about reducing the risk of SIDS. Seeking medical advice if your baby is unwell Babies often have minor illnesses, which you don't need to worry about. Give your baby plenty of fluids to drink and don't let them get too hot. If you're worried about your baby at any point, see your GP or call NHS 111 for advice. Dial 999 for an ambulance if your baby: stops breathing or turns blue is struggling for breath  is unconscious or seems unaware of what's going on won\u2019t wake up has a fit for the first time, even if they seem to recover Read more about spotting signs of serious illness in children. Support services If a baby dies suddenly and unexpectedly, there will need to be an investigation into how and why they died. A post-mortem examination will usually be necessary, which can be very distressing for the family. The police and healthcare professionals work closely to investigate unexpected infant deaths and ensure the family is supported. They should be able to put you in touch with local sources of help and support. Many people find talking to others who have had similar experiences helps them to cope with their bereavement. The Lullaby Trust provides advice and support for bereaved families. Specially trained advisers are available on their helpline. The number is 0808 802 6868 and it's open Monday to Friday (10am-5pm), and at weekends and public holidays (6pm-10pm). You can also visit their website for further information and support if you are bereaved. The Babyloss and Sands websites are useful resources for those affected by the death of a baby during pregnancy, at birth or shortly afterwards. Read more about bereavement. Information about your child If your baby was affected by SIDS, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

If you're reading this because you have, or have had, thoughts about taking your own life, it's important you ask someone for help. It's probably difficult for you to see at this time, but you're not alone and not beyond help. Many people who have had suicidal thoughts say they were so overwhelmed by negative feelings they felt they had no other option. However, with support and treatment they were able to allow the negative feelings to pass. Getting help If you are feeling suicidal, there are people you can talk to who want to help: speak to a friend, family member or someone you trust as they may be able to help you calm down and find some breathing space call the Samaritans 24-hour support service on 116 123 go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department and tell the staff how you are feeling contact NHS 111 make an urgent appointment to see your GP Read more about getting help if you're feeling suicidal. Worried someone else is suicidal If you're worried that someone you know may be considering suicide, try to encourage them to talk about how they are feeling. Listening is the best way to help. Try to avoid offering solutions and try not to judge.  If they've previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition, such as depression, you can speak to a member of their care team for help and advice. Read more about suicide warning signs and how you can help someone with suicidal thoughts. Why do some people take their own life? There's no single reason why someone may try to take their own life, but certain things can increase the risk.  A person may be more likely to have suicidal thoughts if they have a mental health condition, such as depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Misusing alcohol or drugs and having poor job security can also make a person more vulnerable. It's not always possible to prevent suicidal thoughts, but keeping your mind healthy with regular exercise, healthy eating and maintaining friendships can help you cope better with stressful or upsetting situations. Read more about the causes of suicide and preventing suicide. Self-harm Many people who self-harm don't want to kill themselves. Self-harming can be a kind of \"survival strategy\", providing a person with a way of coping with overwhelming emotions. However, self-harming is usually a sign that a person needs immediate help and support. Read about self-harm for more information and advice.

It usually causes the skin to become red, sore, warm, tender and occasionally itchy for about a week. The skin will normally start to flake and peel after a few days and will usually fully heal within seven days. While sunburn is often short-lived and mild, it's important to try to avoid it, because it can increase your chances of developing serious health problems, such as skin cancer, in later life. It\u2019s easy to underestimate your exposure to the sun when outside, as the redness doesn\u2019t usually develop for several hours. Breezes and getting wet (such as going in and out of the sea) may cool your skin, so you don\u2019t realise you\u2019re getting burnt. You should always be aware of the risk of sunburn if you\u2019re outside in strong sun, and look out for your skin getting hot. What to do if you're sunburnt If you or your child has sunburn, you should get out of the sun as soon as possible \u2013 head indoors or into a shady area. You can usually treat mild sunburn at home, although there are some circumstances where you should seek medical advice (see below). The following advice may help to relieve your symptoms until your skin heals: Cool the skin by sponging it with cold water or by having a cold bath or shower \u2013 applying a cold compress such as a cold flannel to the affected area may also help. Drink plenty of fluids to cool you down and prevent dehydration. Apply a water-based emollient or petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline) to keep your skin cool and moist. Take painkillers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to relieve any pain \u2013 aspirin should not be given to children under 16. Try to avoid all sunlight, including through windows, by covering up the affected areas of skin until your skin has fully healed. When to seek medical advice You should contact your GP, attend an NHS walk-in centre, or call NHS 111 for advice if you feel unwell or have any concerns about your sunburn, particularly if you are burnt over a large area or have any of the more severe symptoms listed below. You should also see your GP if a young child or baby has sunburn, as their skin is particularly fragile. Signs of severe sunburn can include: blistering or swelling of the skin (oedema) chills a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above, or 37.5C (99.5F) or above in children under five dizziness, headaches and feeling sick (symptoms of heat exhaustion) Your GP may recommend using hydrocortisone cream for a few days (this is also available over the counter at pharmacies) to reduce the inflammation of your skin. Severe sunburn may require special burn cream and burn dressings from your GP or a nurse at your GP surgery. Very occasionally, hospital treatment may be needed. Who's at risk of sunburn? Everyone who is exposed to UV light is at risk of getting sunburn, although some people are more vulnerable than others. You should take extra care when out in the sun if you: have pale, white or light brown skin have freckles or red or fair hair tend to burn rather than tan have many moles have skin problems relating to a medical condition are only exposed to intense sun occasionally \u2013 for example, while on holiday are in a hot country where the sun is particularly intense have a family history of skin cancer People who spend a lot of time in the sun, whether it\u2019s for work or play, are at increased risk of skin cancer if they don\u2019t take the right precautions. Snow, sand, concrete and water can reflect the sun\u2019s rays onto your skin, and the sun is more intense at high altitudes.  Dangers of UV rays The short-term risks of sun exposure are sunburn and sun allergy. The longer-term risks (over decades) include: actinic (solar) keratoses \u2013 rough and scaly pre-cancerous spots on the skin skin cancer \u2013 including both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer eye problems \u2013 such as photokeratitis (snow blindness) and cataracts premature ageing of the skin and wrinkling Preventing sunburn Skin should be protected from strong sunlight by covering up with suitable clothing, seeking shade and applying sunscreen. In the UK, the risk of getting sunburnt is highest from March to October, particularly from 11am to 3pm, when the sun's rays are strongest. There is also a risk of getting sunburn in other weather conditions \u2013 for example, light reflecting off snow can also cause sunburn. You can also burn in cloudy and cool conditions. Suitable clothing: a wide-brimmed hat that shades the face, neck and ears a long-sleeved top trousers or long skirts in close-weave fabrics that do not allow sunlight through sunglasses with wraparound lenses or wide arms with the CE Mark and European Standard EN 1836:2005. Sunscreen: When buying sunscreen, make sure it's suitable for your skin and blocks both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. The sunscreen label should have: the letters \"UVA\" in a circle logo and at least 4-star UVA protection at least SPF15 sunscreen to protect against UVB Most people do not apply enough sunscreen. The amount of sunscreen needed for the body of an average adult to achieve the stated sun protection factor (SPF) is around 35ml or 6 to 8 teaspoons of lotion. Video: how to apply sunscreen. If sunscreen is applied too thinly, it provides less protection. If you\u2019re worried you might not be applying enough SPF15, you could use a stronger SPF30 sunscreen. If you plan to be out in the sun long enough to risk burning, sunscreen needs to be applied twice: 30 minutes before going out just before you go out Sunscreen should be applied to all exposed skin, including the face, neck and ears (and head if you have thinning or no hair), but a wide-brimmed hat is better. How long it takes for your skin to go red or burn varies from person to person. The Cancer Research UK website has a handy tool where you can find out your skin type, to see when you might be at risk of burning. Water-resistant sunscreen is needed if sweating or contact with water is likely. Sunscreen needs to be reapplied liberally, frequently and according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. This includes straight after you've been in water (even if it is \"water-resistant\") and after towel drying, sweating or when it may have rubbed off. Advice for babies and children Children aged under six months should be kept out of direct strong sunlight. From March to October in the UK, children should: cover up with suitable clothing spend time in the shade (particularly from 11am to 3pm) wear at least SPF15 sunscreen To ensure they get enough vitamin D, children aged under five are advised to take vitamin D supplements even if they do get out in the sun.

The vein becomes inflamed because there is blood clotting inside it or the vein walls are damaged. Superficial thrombophlebitis is the term for an inflamed vein near the surface of the skin (usually a varicose vein), caused by a blood clot. What are the symptoms? Superficial thrombophlebitis results in painful, hard lumps underneath the skin and redness of the overlying skin. This is usually on the lower leg, although it can occasionally affect surface veins in the arms, penis or breast. Is it serious? Superficial thrombophlebitis is typically more annoying than serious.  Usually, the blood clot clears and the inflammation dies down within a few weeks. Most people with superficial thrombophlebitis are otherwise well. There shouldn't be any foul discharge or abscess, and it's normally just lumps under the skin rather than swelling of the whole calf. This may be painful, but it shouldn't prevent you walking reasonably well. Who is most at risk? You're more at risk of superficial thrombophlebitis if you: have varicose veins smoke are very overweight take the contraceptive Pill or HRT (although these only slightly increase your risk of blood clots) are pregnant have had a previous blood clot or other problem with the vein have recently had injections or a drip put into the vein  have a condition that causes the blood to clot more easily, such as thrombophilia, polyarteritis (inflammation of the smaller arteries) or polycythaemia (a high concentration of red blood cells in your blood) have cancer How is it treated? Phlebitis is inflammation, not infection, so antibiotics aren't helpful. You can follow this advice to help reduce any pain and swelling: raise the leg to help reduce swelling wear compression stockings to help reduce swelling keep active, to keep the blood circulating press a cold flannel over the vein to ease any pain take anti-inflammatory painkillers (aspirin is best) to ease any pain rub an anti-inflammatory cream or gel on the area if the affected area is only small What's the outlook? When the inflammation settles, you may be left with darkened skin and the lump may take three or four months to go. But most people make a full recovery. If the thrombophlebitis occurred in a varicose vein, it is likely that the varicose veins will keep coming back, possibly with further episodes of thrombophlebitis. This is because there's a basic problem with the vein, and you may need this removing. Read about the treatment of varicose veins. Risk of DVT There's a small chance of the blood clot travelling along the vein to where it meets a deeper vein, and a DVT developing. This is more likely if the surface clot extends into the upper thigh or groin, or behind the knee (in places where superficial veins meet deeper veins). It is also more likely to occur if the affected vein is a normal vein, rather than a varicose vein, if you have had a DVT before, or if you are immobile. A DVT can cause pain, swelling and a heavy ache in your leg \u2013 see your GP immediately if you experience these symptoms. Read more about DVTs.

You may also experience: chest pain dizziness light-headedness breathlessness Episodes of SVT can last for seconds, minutes, hours or even days, in rare cases. They may occur several times a day, or only once or twice a year. Read more about the symptoms of SVT. When to seek medical help SVT is rarely life-threatening, but you should contact your GP as soon as possible, if you experience symptoms. A test called an electrocardiogram (ECG) can be used to confirm a diagnosis of SVT, if the heart is still racing. Occasionally, an ECG can show abnormalities that suggest you have SVT, even when your heart rhythm returns to normal. As SVT can sometimes be difficult to diagnose, your GP may refer you to a cardiologist (heart specialist) who specialises in treating heart rhythm disorders, called an electrophysiologist. Dial 999 to request an ambulance if you experience severe chest pain or breathing difficulties and you feel faint. Read more about diagnosing SVT. What causes SVT? SVT occurs when there's a problem with the heart's electrical system, which controls your heart rhythm. This causes the heart to beat much faster than normal. In some people, SVT results from an extra electrical connection in the heart present from birth (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), but it can also occur in hearts that are otherwise normal. SVT can occur in anyone at any age and often starts for the first time in children or young adults. Generally, the fast heart rate happens more frequently and lasts longer the older you get. SVT can be triggered by the extra heartbeats (ectopic heartbeats) that most people experience, but some episodes are brought on by things like drinking large amounts of alcohol or caffeine, stress, or smoking lots of cigarettes. Read more about the causes of SVT. Treating SVT Most episodes of SVT are harmless, don't last long and settle on their own without treatment. However, the symptoms are often troublesome and treatments are available to stop ongoing episodes and prevent them occurring in the future. Ongoing episodes of SVT can sometimes be stopped using certain manoeuvres, such as the Valsalva manoeuvre, that slow down the electrical impulses in the heart by stimulating a nerve called the vagus nerve. The Valsalva manoeuvre usually involves holding your nose, closing your mouth and trying to exhale hard, while straining as if you were on the toilet. If manoeuvres like this are ineffective, injections of medication or an electric shock treatment called cardioversion can usually help to stop ongoing SVT episodes. To prevent future episodes, medication that's taken every day can be prescribed. However, the definitive treatment is a procedure called catheter ablation, which involves destroying the tiny areas of the heart that are causing problems. It's very effective at preventing future episodes. Read more about treating SVT.

Alternative forms of the medicine are sometimes available, or you may just need to experiment with some simple swallowing techniques. This page gives some basic advice and outlines the clinical and legal issues around crushing tablets or opening capsules. This advice applies to: adults who have difficulty swallowing pills parents of children who struggle to swallow pills nurses or carers of people with dysphagia (swallowing problems) Finding an alternative form If you or the person you care for finds it difficult to swallow tablets or capsules, you can ask your GP or pharmacist if there's an alternative form of the medicine. The Swallowing Difficulties website and the British National Formulary (BNF) may also have details of possible alternatives. Your pills may also be available in one of the following forms: a liquid \u2013 particularly useful for people with dysphagia who rely on a feeding tube a dispersible \u2013 tablet that disintegrates in water a buccal \u2013 tablet that dissolves when held between cheek and gum a patch a suppository \u2013 inserted into the bottom or vagina  a cream an inhaled version Seek the advice of a doctor or pharmacist if you feel unsure about giving medicine \u2013 for example, if you're not sure how to give liquid medicine through a feeding tube. Crushing tablets or opening capsules You can ask your GP or pharmacist if your tablets can be crushed, or your capsules opened and dispersed in water, before taking them. Only certain tablets or capsules can be given this way. The following preparations should never be crushed without seeking professional advice first: CR or CRT (controlled release, or controlled release tablet) LA (long-acting) SR (sustained release) TR (time release) TD (time delay) SA (sustained action) XL (extended release) These medications are designed to be released over a predetermined period of time \u2013 for example, 12-24 hours. Generally, when crushing a tablet or opening a capsule, the dose is released over 5-10 minutes, resulting in an initial overdose (and a higher chance of side effects), followed by a period without medication. Legal issues A nurse or carer of someone with dysphagia shouldn't alter the form of a medicine by crushing or opening it, unless they've been instructed to do so by a doctor. If you crush or open the medicine to give to another person, you're administering it in an unlicensed form. If you haven't consulted a doctor about it, this would render you personally liable for any harm caused, and you would have to justify your actions in the event of an adverse reaction. The Swallowing Difficulties website has more information about the legal consequences of tablet crushing. 10 tips for swallowing pills 1. Moisten your mouth with saliva or water beforehand (a dry mouth makes swallowing harder). 2. Place the pill in the centre of your tongue, and lengthways along your tongue if the pill is oval-shaped. 3. Immediately take a sip of water and wash the pill directly into your throat, throwing your head back.   4. Hold water in your mouth before inserting the pill \u2013 suspending the pill in water may help to flush it down. 5. Try using a straw to drink the water (the suction may help). 6. Taking a deep breath may help suppress your gag reflex.  7. Try chewing some food before placing the pill in your mouth, and swallow the food and pill together. 8. Insert the pill into a small piece of bread or marshmallow. 9. After swallowing the pill, follow it up with food to help it go down. 10. Try putting your chin to your chest when swallowing \u2013 this will open up your windpipe and may be better for you than throwing your head back. NB: These tips are based on common sense, rather than scientific evidence, and may not work for everyone.

Some people with dysphagia have problems swallowing certain foods or liquids, while others can't swallow at all. Other signs of dysphagia include: coughing or choking when eating or drinking bringing food back up, sometimes through the nose a sensation that food is stuck in your throat or chest persistent drooling of saliva  Over time, dysphagia can also cause symptoms such as weight loss and repeated chest infections.

Dysphagia is usually caused by another health condition, such as: a condition that affects the nervous system, such as a stroke, head injury, or dementia cancer \u2013 such as mouth cancer or oesophageal cancer  gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) \u2013 where stomach acid leaks back up into the oesophagus Dysphagia can also occur in children as the result of a developmental or learning disability. Dysphagia can be caused by problems with the: mouth or throat, known as oropharyngeal or \"high\" dysphagia oesophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach), known as oesophageal or \"low\" dysphagia   Read more about the causes of dysphagia. Treating dysphagia Treatment usually depends on the cause and type of dysphagia. The type of dysphagia you have can usually be diagnosed after testing your swallowing ability and examining your oesophagus. Many cases of dysphagia can be improved with treatment, but a cure isn't always possible. Treatments for dysphagia include: speech and language therapy to learn new swallowing techniques  changing the consistency of food and liquids to make them safer to swallow alternative forms of feeding, such as tube feeding through the nose or stomach surgery to widen the narrowing of the oesophagus by stretching it or inserting a plastic or metal tube (known as a stent) Read more about diagnosing dysphagia and treating dysphagia. Complications of dysphagia Dysphagia can sometimes lead to further problems. One of the most common problems is coughing or choking when food goes down the \"wrong way\" and blocks your airway. If this occurs frequently, you may avoid eating and drinking because you fear choking, which can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. Some people with dysphagia have a tendency to develop chest infections, such as aspiration pneumonia, which require medical treatment. Dysphagia can also affect your quality of life as it may prevent you enjoying meals and social occasions. Read more about the complications of dysphagia.

Prickly heat can develop anywhere on the body, but it usually appears on your face, neck, back, chest or thighs a few days after exposure to hot temperatures. The rash is made up of tiny spots or bumps that are surrounded by an area of red skin. The spots sometimes look like tiny blisters and can cause: mild swelling itching a stinging or intense prickling sensation Causes of prickly heat Prickly heat usually develops when a person sweats more than usual, such as during hot or humid weather. However, it's also possible to get prickly heat in the winter. The condition is caused when the body's sweat glands become blocked. Excessive sweating can result in sweat becoming trapped beneath your skin. The trapped sweat causes skin irritation and the characteristic heat rash. The symptoms of prickly heat are usually worse in areas that are covered by clothing. This is because clothing can make you sweat and sometimes causes friction (rubbing). Who gets prickly heat? Although anyone can get prickly heat, you're more at risk of developing it if you're in a hot climate where you sweat more than usual. The following also increase your risk: illness and immobility \u2013 long periods of time spent in bed can make you sweat more, particularly if you have warm bedding wearing too much clothing, particularly in the winter sitting too close to a fire or heater being overweight or obese \u2013 which is more likely to lead to excessive sweating Babies and children are also more at risk of getting prickly heat, because their sweat glands aren't fully developed. Treating prickly heat Prickly heat isn't a serious condition and rarely requires any specific treatment. The rash usually disappears after a few days. However, there are several things you can do to ease your symptoms: Avoid excessive heat and humidity \u2013 if you need to go outside, spend time in the shade or take a small fan with you. Further exposure to the heat will cause you to sweat more and may make your rash worse. Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration, especially in hot weather. Wear loose cotton clothing \u2013 avoid wearing synthetic fibres, such as polyester and nylon, which trap heat easier than natural fibres. Keep your skin cool \u2013 a cool bath or shower will cool you down, soothe your skin and help prevent further sweating. Staying in an air-conditioned room for a few hours a day will also provide considerable relief. You can also use a cold compress, but don't leave it on the skin for longer than 20 minutes. Use calamine lotion \u2013 this is available at most pharmacies and will help soothe sore and irritated skin. Try hydrocortisone cream \u2013 low-strength hydrocortisone cream is also available from pharmacies and is effective at treating very itchy and irritated areas of skin. However, avoid using it on your face and always follow the instructions. Antihistamine tablets may help control itching \u2013 but consult your GP first as they're not always suitable Read more about staying safe in the sun. Babies and rashes If your baby has a rash and appears to be unwell, you should visit your GP or contact NHS 111. Prickly heat is common in babies and doesn't cause any serious harm. However, if you're concerned, your GP will be able to confirm the cause of your baby's rash and give appropriate treatment. Read more about skin rashes in babies.

The sweating may affect the whole of your body, or it may only affect certain areas. Commonly affected areas include the: armpits palms of your hands soles of your feet face and chest groin Both sides of the body are usually affected equally \u2013 for example, both feet or both hands. The sweating doesn't usually pose a serious threat to your health, but it can be embarrassing and distressing. It can also have a negative impact on your quality of life and may lead to feelings of depression and anxiety. Read more about the complications of hyperhidrosis. What is excessive sweating? There are no guidelines to determine what \"normal\" sweating is, but if you feel you sweat too much and your sweating has started to interfere with your everyday daily life, you may have hyperhidrosis. For example, you may have hyperhidrosis if: you avoid physical contact, such as shaking hands, because you feel self-conscious about your sweating you don't take part in activities, such as dancing or exercise, for fear they will make your sweating worse excessive sweating is interfering with your job \u2013 for example, you have difficulty holding tools or using a computer keyboard you're having problems with normal daily activities, such as driving you're spending a significant amount of time coping with sweating \u2013 for example, frequently showering and changing your clothes you become socially withdrawn and self-conscious When to see your GP Visit your GP if you feel that your sweating is interfering with your daily activities, or you suddenly start sweating excessively. Many people with hyperhidrosis are too embarrassed to seek medical help or believe that nothing can be done to improve it. But treatment is available. Also visit your GP if you are having night sweats, because it can sometimes be a sign of something more serious. Your GP will usually be able to diagnose hyperhidrosis based on your symptoms, although occasionally you may need blood and urine tests to check for an underlying cause (see below). What causes hyperhidrosis? In many cases, hyperhidrosis has no obvious cause and is thought to be the result of a problem with the part of the nervous system that controls sweating. This is known as primary hyperhidrosis. Hyperhidrosis that does have an identifiable cause is known as secondary hyperhidrosis. This can have many different triggers, including: pregnancy or the menopause anxiety certain medications low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) infections Read more about the causes of hyperhidrosis. How hyperhidrosis is treated Excessive sweating can be challenging to treat and it may take a while to find a treatment right for you.  Doctors usually recommend starting with the least invasive treatment first, such as powerful antiperspirants. Lifestyle changes may also help, including: wearing loose and light clothes avoiding triggers, such as alcohol and spicy foods, that could make your sweating worse wearing black or white clothes to help minimise the signs of sweating If this doesn\u2019t help, you may be advised to try treatments such as iontophoresis (the affected area is treated with a weak electric current passed through water or a wet pad), botulinum toxin injections, and even surgery in a few cases. Hyperhidrosis is usually a long-term condition, but some people experience an improvement with time and the treatments available can often keep the problem under control. Read more about treating hyperhidrosis. Who is affected Hyperhidrosis is common. It's been estimated to affect between one and three in every 100 people which means there are likely to be hundreds of thousands of people living with it in the UK. Hyperhidrosis can develop at any age, although primary hyperhidrosis typically starts during childhood or soon after puberty.

However, see your GP if you develop a new lump or swelling so that the cause can be identified. A painful lump or swelling that appears suddenly over a day or two may be caused by an injury or infection. It's likely to be an infection if the skin around the lump is red and warm. Your GP can advise you about how to care for this. Below are some of the most common reasons for an unexplained lump or swelling under the skin in the following areas of the body: face  neck or throat  breast  groin area   testicle    anus (bottom)  hand, wrist or finger  shoulders, back, chest or arm  armpit  This information should give you an idea about what your lump or swelling might be. However, don't use it to diagnose yourself with a condition. Always leave that to your doctor.  Facial swelling or lump A lump or swelling on the face that wasn't caused by an injury is most likely to be one of the following: mumps \u2013 a viral infection that usually affects children and causes swelling of the glands on the side of the face an allergic reaction \u2013 for example to peanuts, which causes swelling in the deeper layers of the skin (angioedema)  a dental abscess \u2013 that causes the side of the mouth to swell a salivary gland stone \u2013 this forms when the chemicals in saliva crystallise and block the flow of saliva from a salivary gland near the jaw, causing pain and swelling around the jaw Click on the links above for more information about these conditions.  Lump in the neck or throat A lump in the neck or throat is most likely to be one of the following: swollen glands \u2013 usually a sign of infection, such as a cold or glandular fever; the glands tend to go down when you recover a cyst \u2013 a harmless fluid-filled lump that may disappear on its own without treatment (it will feel like a pea and roll under the skin when you press it) a skin tag \u2013 a harmless, knobbly wart-like growth that hangs off the skin and can be left alone a goitre \u2013 an abnormal swelling of the thyroid gland in the neck that causes a lump to form in the throat   Click on the links above for more information about these conditions. Lump in the breast Breast lumps are common and have several different causes. While most breast lumps aren't breast cancer, any unusual changes to the breasts should be checked by a GP as soon as possible. Common causes of breast lumps include: mastitis \u2013 painful, swollen breast tissue that is sometimes caused by an infection  enlarged milk ducts a non-cancerous growth (fibroadenoma) a cyst \u2013 a harmless fluid-filled lump a lipoma \u2013 a harmless fatty lump  a skin tag \u2013 a harmless, wart-like growth often found underneath the breast Read more about breast lumps.  Lump around the groin area Common causes of a lump or lumps in the groin area include: a cyst \u2013 a harmless fluid-filled lump swollen glands \u2013 usually a sign of infection, such as a cold or glandular fever; the glands tend to go down when you recover a hernia \u2013 where an internal part of the body, such as part of the bowel, pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding tissue wall an enlarged vein \u2013 known as a saphena varix, which is caused by a faulty valve inside the vein (the lump often disappears when you lie down) genital warts \u2013 small, fleshy growths caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) Click on the links above for more information on these conditions.  Lump or swelling in the testicle Most testicular lumps are harmless and aren't cancerous. Less than 4 in 100 (4%) of testicular lumps turn out to be testicular cancer.  A lump or swelling in the testicle is most likely to be one of the following: swollen and enlarged veins inside the scrotum (varicoceles) swellings caused by a build-up of fluid around the testicle (hydrocele) a cyst in the epididymis (the long, coiled tube behind the testicles) Read more about testicular lumps and swellings. Lump around the anus (bottom) Anal swellings or lumps are usually one of the following: a haemorrhoid (pile) \u2013 a swollen blood vessel that can hang outside the anus  a skin tag \u2013 a harmless growth that hangs off the skin and looks similar to a wart an abscess \u2013 a painful collection of pus a rectal prolapse \u2013 where part of the rectum (the end of the bowel) sticks out of the anus genital warts \u2013 small, fleshy growths caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) Lump on the hand, wrist or finger A lump on the hand, wrist or finger is probably a ganglion cyst. This is a type of cyst that forms around the joints or tendons. A ganglion cyst usually appears on the back of the wrist. It's made up of a thick jelly-like fluid and feels like a smooth, soft lump under the skin. It's not clear why ganglions form, but they can be related to ageing or to injury to the joint or tendon. If the ganglion doesn't cause any pain or discomfort, it can be left and may disappear without treatment. Otherwise, you may need to have it removed. Sometimes, small rough lumps called warts develop on the hands. Warts are caused by an infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV) and are very contagious. However, they're usually harmless and clear up without treatment.  Lump on the shoulder, back, chest or arm A lump on the shoulder, back, chest or arm is most likely to be a lipoma or a cyst. A lipoma is a soft, fatty lump that grows under the skin. It's fairly common, harmless and can usually be left alone. When you press a lipoma it should feel soft and \"doughy\" to touch. It can range from the size of a pea to a few centimetres across. A cyst is a sac under the skin that contains fluid, usually pus. It can look a bit like a lipoma but is close to the surface of the skin (lipomas are deeper under the skin). Cysts are firm to the touch. A cyst may disappear without treatment or you may need to have it drained. Lump in the armpit A lump in the armpit is likely to be a swollen lymph gland, particularly if you also feel unwell and have other signs of an infection. The glands in the armpit can swell to more than a few centimetres in response to infection or illness. Swollen glands usually go down when you recover. It's uncommon for a lump in the armpit to be a lymphoma (cancer of the lymph glands), but you should see your GP if the lump doesn't go down. A small, knobbly lump in your armpit that hangs off the skin like a wart is probably a skin tag. Skin tags grow where skin rubs against skin or clothing, which is why they're often seen under the arm. They're very common and harmless, and can be left alone. When to see your GP See your GP if you develop a growth or swelling on your body. They can examine it and confirm what it is and what's causing it. If your GP is uncertain, they may recommend that you have an ultrasound scan or a biopsy. Surgery may be needed to remove certain types of lump. You should also see your GP if you have a lump that: is getting bigger is painful feels hard grows back after it's been removed In this case, your doctor will want to rule out other types of lump, such as a sarcoma (a very rare type of soft tissue cancer). You can read more about different types of soft tissue sarcoma on the Cancer Research UK website.

Otitis externa is often referred to as \"swimmer's ear\" because repeated exposure to water can make the ear canal more vulnerable to inflammation. Symptoms of otitis externa include: ear pain, which can be severe itchiness in the ear canal a discharge of liquid or pus from the ear some degree of temporary hearing loss Usually only one ear is affected. With treatment, these symptoms should clear up within a few days. However, some cases can persist for several months or longer. Read more about the symptoms of otitis externa. When to see your GP You should see your GP if you may have otitis externa. Your GP will ask about your symptoms and whether you regularly use any items that are inserted into your ears, such as hearing aids or ear plugs. They may also examine inside your ear using an instrument called an otoscope. If you have recurring episodes of otitis externa that haven't responded to treatment, your GP may take a swab of the inside of your ear. This will be tested to help determine what type of infection you have, if any, so appropriate medication can be prescribed. What causes otitis externa? Most cases of otitis externa are caused by a bacterial infection, although the condition can also be caused by: irritation fungal infections allergies There are a number of things that can make you more likely to develop otitis externa, including: damaging the skin inside your ear regularly getting water in your ear Getting water in your ear is particularly significant, because this can cause you to scratch inside your ear, and the moisture also provides an ideal environment for bacteria to grow. Read more about the causes of otitis externa. Who is affected? Otitis externa is relatively common. It's estimated that around 1 in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their lives. The condition is slightly more common in women than men and is most often diagnosed in adults aged 45 to 75. People with certain long-term (chronic) conditions are at greater risk of developing the condition. These include: eczema asthma allergic rhinitis How otitis externa is treated Otitis externa sometimes gets better without treatment, but it can take several weeks. Your GP can prescribe ear drop medication that usually improves the symptoms within a few days. There are a number of different types of ear drops that may be used to treat otitis externa, but they all tend to be used several times a day for about a week.  Your GP may refer you to a specialist for further treatment and advice if symptoms are severe or they fail to respond to treatment. Read more about treating otitis externa. Preventing otitis externa To help reduce your chances of developing otitis externa, you should avoid inserting cotton wool buds and other things into your ears (including your fingers), as this can damage the sensitive skin in your ear canal. If you're a regular swimmer, consider using ear plugs when swimming or wearing a swimming cap to cover your ears and protect them from water. You should also try to avoid getting water, soap or shampoo into your ears when you have a shower or bath. Read more about preventing otitis externa. Complications Complications of otitis externa are uncommon, but some can be very serious. One rare complication of otitis externa is malignant otitis externa, which is where an infection spreads from the ear canal into the surrounding bone. This requires prompt treatment with antibiotics and sometimes surgery, as it can be fatal if left untreated. Read more about the complications of otitis externa.

It was responsible for the flu pandemic in 2009-10. The virus is officially known as influenza virus A\/H1N1pdm09. The swine flu pandemic The virus was first identified in Mexico in April 2009 and was also known as Mexican flu. It became known as swine flu because the virus closely resembled known influenza viruses that cause illness in pigs. It spread rapidly from country to country because it was a new type of flu virus that few people were immune to. The pandemic proved to be relatively mild and was not as serious as originally predicted. As in other countries, most cases reported in the UK were mild. However, a small number of cases resulted in serious illness and death. These were mostly in the very elderly, very young, pregnant women, or people with a pre-existing health condition, such as cancer, that had already weakened their immune systems. On August 10 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic was officially over. The virus now circulates worldwide as one of three seasonal flu viruses. The other viruses are influenza virus B and influenza virus A\/H3N2. Symptoms of flu The symptoms of flu caused by the H1N1pdm09 virus are similar to those of other types, and include: a sudden fever \u2013 a temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above tiredness aching muscles or joint pain a headache a runny or blocked nose Most people recover within a week, even without special treatment. However, some people are at a higher risk of complications and are recommended to have the seasonal flu jab. The 2015-16 seasonal flu jab includes protection against three types of flu virus, including H1N1pdm09. When to see your GP If you are otherwise fit and healthy, there is usually no need to visit your GP if you have flu-like symptoms. See your GP if you have flu-like symptoms and are at a higher risk of complications of seasonal flu. This includes: children under two years old anyone over the age of 65 pregnant women children and adults with an underlying health condition (particularly long-term heart or respiratory disease) children and adults with weakened immune systems Vaccination The seasonal flu jab is available for free on the NHS for those at risk and is given as an annual injection to: adults over the age of 18 at risk of flu (including everyone over 65) children aged from six months to two years who are at risk of flu The flu vaccine is also offered as an annual nasal spray to: children aged 2 to 18 years at risk of flu children aged two, three and four all children in school years 1 and 2 Read more information about who should have the flu jab and why pregnant women should have the flu jab. How is swine flu treated? The best remedy is to rest at home, keep warm and drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. You can take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower a high temperature and relieve aches. If further treatment is needed or complications develop, medication is available to treat flu caused by the H1N1pdm09 virus. This includes: antiviral medications \u2013 oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) help relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of serious complications antibiotics \u2013 to combat bacterial infections such as pneumonia, which may occur as a complication of influenza If you are prescribed antivirals, you will need to pay a prescription charge (unless your prescriptions are normally free of charge). Read the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on antivirals for the treatment of flu.  Preventing the spread of flu The H1N1pdm09 virus is spread in exactly the same way as the common cold and other flu viruses. The virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when someone coughs or sneezes. These droplets typically spread about 1 metre (3 feet). They hang suspended in the air for a while, but then land on surfaces, where the virus can survive for up to 24 hours. Anyone who touches these surfaces can spread the virus by touching anything else. The virus is also transmitted by infected people who cough or sneeze into their hands and then touch other people or objects before washing their hands. Everyday items at home and in public places may have traces of the virus. These include food, door handles, remote controls, hand rails, paper money and computer keyboards. People usually become infected by picking up the virus on their hands from contaminated objects and then placing their hands near their mouth or nose. It is also possible to breathe in the virus if it is suspended in airborne droplets. Good hygiene, such as hand washing and cleaning, is the most effective way of slowing the spread of flu. Antiviral medication and the seasonal flu jab are also offered to people at risk. Read more information about: preventing seasonal flu home hygiene You can also read the NICE guidelines on antivirals for the prevention of flu.

It spreads rapidly through small droplets coughed or sneezed into the air by an infected person. Some people are at greater risk of developing serious complications of flu, such as bronchitis and pneumonia. The flu vaccination is offered to people in at-risk groups.

The swelling can occur in one particular part of the body or may be more general, depending on the cause. Fluid can accumulate under the skin \u2013 most commonly causing swelling of the lower legs and ankles \u2013 or in one of the body's internal organs, such as the lungs. As well as swelling or puffiness of the skin, oedema can also cause: skin discolouration areas of skin that temporarily hold the imprint of your finger when pressed (known as pitting oedema) aching, tender limbs stiff joints weight gain Types of oedema Oedema is most common in the feet and ankles. This is known as peripheral oedema. Other types of oedema include: cerebral oedema \u2013 affecting the brain pulmonary oedema \u2013 affecting the lungs macular oedema \u2013 affecting the eyes Idiopathic oedema is a term used to describe cases of oedema where a cause can't be found. Causes of oedema It's normal to have some swelling in your legs at the end of the day, particularly if you've been sitting or standing for long periods. Oedema is often a symptom of an underlying health condition. It can occur as a result of the following conditions or treatments: pregnancy kidney disease  heart failure  chronic lung disease  thyroid disease liver disease   malnutrition medication, such as corticosteroids or medicine for high blood pressure (hypertension) the contraceptive pill Immobility and standing for long periods are the two most common causes of oedema in the legs. Other possible causes include: a blood clot severe varicose veins a leg injury or leg surgery burns to the skin Treating oedema Oedema is often temporary and clears up by itself. For example, if you've been standing up for too long on a hot day, your ankles may swell up until you get the chance to put your feet up and rest. If oedema doesn't go away by itself, see your GP. They'll try and find out if there's an underlying cause which needs to be treated. This could involve taking medication or following some advice, such as: losing weight (if you're overweight) taking regular exercise, such as walking, swimming or cycling raising your legs three to four times a day to improve your circulation avoiding standing for long periods of time If an underlying condition is causing the fluid imbalance, it should clear up after the condition has been diagnosed and treated. Lymphoedema Lymphoedema is swelling in the legs caused by a blockage in the lymphatic system, or an inherited condition. The lymphatic system consists of a series of lymph nodes (glands) connected by a network of vessels (lymphatics), similar to blood vessels. Fluid surrounding body tissues usually drains into nearby lymph vessels so it can be transported back into the blood. However, if the lymph vessels are blocked, the fluid can't be reabsorbed and will build up in the tissue. Unlike oedema, lymphoedema is a long-term condition that can cause discomfort, pain and a loss of mobility. It can't be cured, but it can be controlled using a number of treatments, including: compression stockings skin care lymphatic massage elevation Read more about lymphoedema.

Lymph glands (also called lymph nodes) are pea-sized lumps of tissue that contain white blood cells. These help to fight bacteria, viruses and anything else that causes infection. They are an important part of the immune system and are found throughout the body. The glands can swell to more than a few centimetres in response to infection or disease. Swollen glands, known medically as lymphadenopathy, may be felt under the chin or in the neck, armpits or groin, where they can be found in larger clumps. Many different types of infection can cause swollen glands, such as a cold or glandular fever. Less commonly, swollen glands may be caused by a non-infectious condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or even cancer. When to see your GP See your GP if you have swollen glands and: they haven't gone down within a few weeks or are getting bigger they feel hard or don\u2019t move when you press them you also have a sore throat and find it difficult to swallow or breathe you also have unexplained weight loss, night sweats or a persistent high temperature (fever) you don't have an obvious infection and don't feel unwell If necessary, your GP may request some tests to help identify the cause. These can include blood tests, an ultrasound scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan, and\/or a biopsy (where a small sample of fluid is taken from the swelling and tested). Common causes of swollen glands Swollen glands are usually caused by a relatively minor viral or bacterial infection, including: a cold tonsillitis glandular fever a throat infection an ear infection a dental abscess cellulitis (a skin infection) The glands in the affected area will often become suddenly tender or painful. You may also have additional symptoms, such as a sore throat, cough, or fever. These infections usually clear up on their own, and the swollen glands will soon go down. You will normally just need to drink plenty of fluids, rest and relieve the symptoms at home using over-the-counter medicines such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. See your GP if your symptoms don't improve within a few weeks. Less common causes of swollen glands Less often, swollen glands may be the result of: rubella \u2013 a viral infection that causes a red-pink skin rash made up of small spots measles \u2013 a highly infectious viral illness that causes distinctive red or brown spots on the skin   cytomegalovirus (CMV) \u2013 a common virus spread through bodily fluids, such as saliva and urine tuberculosis (TB) \u2013 a bacterial infection spread that causes a persistent cough  syphilis \u2013 a bacterial infection usually caught by having sex with someone who is infected cat scratch disease \u2013 a bacterial infection caused by a scratch from an infected cat HIV \u2013 a virus that attacks the immune system and weakens your ability to fight infections lupus \u2013 where the immune system starts to attack the body's joints, skin, blood cells and organs rheumatoid arthritis \u2013 where the immune system starts to attack the tissue lining the joints sarcoidosis \u2013 where small patches of red and swollen tissue, called granulomas, develop in the organs of the body Click on the links above for more information on these conditions. Could it be cancer? Occasionally, swollen glands can be a sign of cancer that has started elsewhere in the body and spread to the lymph nodes, or a type of cancer affecting the white blood cells, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Swollen glands are more likely to be caused by cancer if they: don't go away within a few weeks and slowly get bigger are painless and firm or hard when you touch them occur with other symptoms, such as night sweats and weight loss See your GP if your glands have been swollen for more than a couple of weeks. The swelling is probably the result of a non-cancerous condition, but it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.

For example, some people with synaesthesia can taste numbers or hear colours. A wide range of different synaesthetic experiences have been reported and recorded \u2013 a typical example is someone who described experiencing the colour red every time he heard the word \"Monday\". What are the different types of synaesthesia? There are many different types of synaesthesia, and many people with synaesthesia will experience more than one of these \u2013 for example, taste, sound and touch may all produce colours. Colours and patterns Research suggests that the most common synaesthetic experiences are associating days, months, numbers and the alphabet with: patterns or shapes (for example, envisaging the months laid out in lines, spirals or circles) distinctive colours \u2013 for example, \"A\" may be red and \"B\" may be blue Synaesthesia affects people differently. Two people with synaesthesia will often disagree over the colour of letters. However, there are some trends that appear common to all people with the condition \u2013 A is generally perceived as red, B is often blue, and C is often yellow. Taste and smell For some people with synaesthesia, spoken words trigger a particular taste, as well as a particular texture, place in the mouth and temperature (for example, \"runny egg yolk\"). Taste can also produce colour sensations, or shapes that can be \"felt\". Certain odours may also be perceived as shapes and\/or colours, but this form of synaesthesia is thought to be rare. Touch and other body sensations Some people experience touch just by looking at someone being touched. This is known as \"mirror touch\" synaesthesia. Feelings of pain or touch can also trigger visions or colour, and there has been a documented case of words triggering feelings of body movement. Advice for people with synaesthesia Most people with synaesthesia have had it since childhood, so it feels perfectly normal to experience the world in this way. It's not obtrusive and does not affect day-to-day life. It's not necessary to see a doctor. If you think your child has synaesthesia If you are a parent of a child with synaesthesia, you may wish to discuss it with their teacher so they are aware of it. There is evidence that synaesthesia affects educational ability, either by slightly distracting the pupil, or (most often) by giving slight learning advantages. It may also be true that your child will learn in different ways to other children. For instance, many people with synaesthesia report a visual style of thinking. If it comes on suddenly in adulthood If you suddenly begin to experience symptoms of synaesthesia for the first time as an adult, it's a good idea to see your GP for an assessment. This is because there could be underlying factors related to your brain and nervous system that may need investigating. Is synaesthesia linked to other conditions? Because the number of people with synaesthesia is relatively small, it is not yet possible to know this conclusively. An Australian study did not find any evidence of an association between synaesthesia and various mental health problems. In fact, there is growing evidence that synaesthesia may be linked to certain advantages, including enhanced memory, superior perception and being able to think more quickly. Two small studies published in 2013 suggest that synaesthesia is more common in adults with autism (also known as autistic spectrum disorder) than in adults who do not have an autistic spectrum disorder. The studies involved screening people with and without autism for synaesthesia. In adults with autism, the prevalence of synaesthesia was estimated to be 17-19%, whereas adults without autism have a much lower prevalence of 2% (for more information, read NHS News: Synaesthesia may be 'more common' in autism). These results appear broadly reliable, but they need to be confirmed in larger studies. If true, these findings imply that the two conditions may share some common cause in the brain. However, it's important to note that most people with autism do not have synaesthesia, and that most people with synaesthesia do not have autism. What's the cause? It's likely that the brain of someone with synaesthesia is \"wired\" differently, or has extra connections. A brain imaging study has shown that when some people with synaesthesia hear spoken words, a part of their brain normally used to process colour from vision lights up. Synaesthesia runs in families, although it may skip a generation and may not affect immediate relatives. It's possible for only one twin to have the condition, or for family members to show different types of synaesthesia. In summary, there is a genetic contribution to synaesthesia, but the environment is also important. It's possible for people to \"grow out of\" synaesthesia: there have been cases of people claiming that they used to experience synaesthesia, but no longer do. How do people with synaesthesia feel about their condition? Interviews with people who have synaesthesia show a wide range of feelings towards their condition. Many are positive about it (\"I feel sorry for people who don't have this\"), and can't imagine their life without it. Some feel neutral about it, and treat it as something they've become used to, which doesn't affect them in any way. For a minority, the sensations can disrupt their chain of thought and be intrusive. How common is it? Synaesthesia has been estimated to affect at least 4% of the UK population. Researchers at the University of Sussex have estimated that 1-2% of the UK population experience colour when they see, hear or think about letters and numbers, and that synaesthesia is just as common in women as in men (read the study). For many people with synaesthesia, letters have a distinctive colour  Can you acquire synaesthesia? Synaesthesia-type symptoms can be experienced after taking hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD or magic mushrooms, and fade as the effects of the drug wear off. But this experience is different to that of naturally occurring synaesthesia. Occasionally, synaesthesia may happen suddenly in adults, and has been linked to sensory loss (such as loss of hearing or vision) or a stroke. This is why it's important to see your GP if synaesthesia symptoms start suddenly in adulthood.

Healthcare professionals often use the term \"syncope\" when referring to fainting, because it distinguishes fainting from other causes of temporary unconsciousness, such as seizures (fits) or concussion.  In most cases, when a person faints, they'll regain consciousness within a minute or two. However, less common types of fainting can be medical emergencies. Dial 999 to request an ambulance if a person who has fainted doesn't regain consciousness within two minutes. What causes a faint? To function properly, the brain relies on oxygen that's carried in the blood. Fainting can occur when the blood flow to the brain is reduced. Your body usually corrects reduced blood flow to the brain quickly, but it can make you feel odd, sweaty and dizzy. If it lasts long enough, you may faint. Read more about the symptoms of fainting. There are various reasons for a reduction in blood flow to the brain, but it's usually related to a temporary malfunction in the autonomic nervous system. This is the part of your nervous system that regulates the body's automatic functions, including heartbeat and blood pressure. This type of fainting is called \"neurally mediated syncope\". Neurally mediated syncope can be triggered by emotional stress, pain or prolonged standing. It can also be caused by physical processes such as coughing, sneezing or laughing. Read more about the causes of fainting. What to do if you or someone else faints If you feel you're about to faint, lie down, preferably in a position where your head is low and your legs are raised. This will encourage blood flow to your brain. If it's not possible to lie down, sit with your head between your knees. If you think someone is about to faint, you should help them to lie down or sit with their head between their knees. If a person faints and doesn't regain consciousness within one or two minutes, put them into the recovery position. To do this: place them on their side so they're supported by one leg and one arm open their airway by tilting their head back and lifting their chin monitor their breathing and pulse continuously You should then dial 999, ask for an ambulance and stay with the person until medical help arrives. Treatment for fainting In most cases, a person will return to normal within a few minutes of fainting, and no further treatment will be needed. If a person experiences repeated episodes of fainting, it's important for a healthcare professional to investigate the cause. Read more about the diagnosis of fainting. Treatment for fainting will depend on the type you're experiencing. In many cases of neurally mediated syncope, no further treatment is needed. If you've had a fainting episode, advice to deal with possible future fainting episodes includes: avoiding triggers \u2013 such as hot and crowded environments, or emotional stress spotting the warning signs \u2013 such as feeling lightheaded lying down to increase blood flow to the brain Read more about how fainting is treated.  Reduced blood flow to the brain can make you feel odd, sweaty and dizzy  Who is affected by fainting? Fainting is very common, affecting up to 4 in 10 people at least once during their lifetime. Most people experience their first episode of fainting before the age of 40. If your first episode occurs after 40, it may be a sign of a serious underlying problem. Neurally mediated syncope is the most common type of fainting. It often occurs for the first time during the teenage years and affects girls more than boys.

It's important to get tested and treated as soon as possible if you think you might have syphilis, as it can cause serious problems if it's left untreated. It can usually be cured with a short course of antibiotics. You can catch syphilis more than once, even if you've been treated for it before. This page covers: Symptoms of syphilis What to do if you think you have syphilis Treatments for syphilis How syphilis is spread Preventing syphilis Syphilis in pregnancy Symptoms of syphilis The symptoms of syphilis aren't always obvious and may eventually disappear, but you'll usually remain infected unless you get treated. Some people with syphilis have no symptoms. Symptoms can include: small, painless sores or ulcers that typically appear on the penis, vagina, or around the anus, but can occur in other places such as the mouth  a blotchy red rash that often affects the palms of the hands or soles of the feet small skin growths (similar to genital warts) that may develop on the vulva in women or around the anus in both men and women white patches in the mouth tiredness, headaches, joint pains, a high temperature (fever), and swollen glands in your neck, groin or armpits If it's left untreated for years, syphilis can spread to the brain or other parts of the body and cause serious, long-term problems. Read more about the symptoms of syphilis. What to do if you think you have syphilis You should get tested as soon as possible if you're worried you could have syphilis, because: syphilis won't normally go away on its own getting tested is the only way to find out if you have it the medicines used to treat syphilis are only available on prescription \u2013 you can't buy them yourself treatment can help reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others and of serious problems developing later on The best place to get tested is your nearest genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic or sexual health clinic. The test for syphilis usually involves a blood test and removing a sample of fluid from any sores using a swab (similar to a cotton bud). Read more about testing for syphilis. Treatments for syphilis Syphilis is usually treated with either: an injection of antibiotics into your buttocks \u2013 most people will only need one dose, although three injections given at weekly intervals may be recommended if you've had syphilis for a long time a course of antibiotics tablets if you can't have the injection \u2013 this will usually last two or four weeks, depending on how long you've had syphilis  You should avoid any kind of sexual activity or close sexual contact with another person until at least two weeks after your treatment finishes. Read more about treating syphilis. How syphilis is spread Syphilis is mainly spread through close contact with an infected sore. This usually happens during vaginal, anal or oral sex, or by sharing sex toys with someone who's infected. Anyone who's sexually active is potentially at risk. Pregnant women with syphilis can also pass the infection to their unborn baby. Read more about Syphilis in pregnancy below. It may be possible to catch syphilis if you're an injecting drug user and you share needles with somebody who's infected, or through blood transfusions (this is very rare in the UK as all blood donations are tested for syphilis). Syphilis can't be spread by using the same toilet, clothing, cutlery or bathroom as an infected person. Preventing syphilis Syphilis can't always be prevented, but if you're sexually active you can reduce your risk by practising safer sex: use a male condom or female condom during vaginal, oral and anal sex use a dental dam (a square of plastic) during oral sex avoid sharing sex toys \u2013 if you do share them, wash them and cover them with a condom before each use These measures can also reduce your risk of catching other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If you're an injecting drug user, don't use other people's needles or share your needles with others. Syphilis in pregnancy If a woman becomes infected while she's pregnant, or becomes pregnant when she already has syphilis, it can be very dangerous for her baby if not treated. Infection in pregnancy can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or a serious infection in the baby (congenital syphilis). Screening for syphilis during pregnancy is offered to all pregnant women so the infection can be detected and treated before it causes any serious problems.

There are four main types, but type 1, called Chiari I, is the most common. In someone with Chiari I, the lowest part of the back of the brain extends into the spinal canal. This can put pressure on the brainstem, spinal cord, and obstruct the flow of fluid. This page focuses on Chiari I malformations. Is it serious? Symptoms Treatments Causes Are Chiari I malformations serious? The severity of Chiari malformations can vary from person to person, but generally: Chiari I malformations aren't considered life-threatening some people experience painful headaches, movement problems and other unpleasant symptoms (see below), but many people won't have any symptoms  there's a chance of developing syringomyelia (where a fluid-filled cavity called a syrinx develops in the spinal cord), which can damage the spinal cord if not treated promptly surgery can usually stop the symptoms getting worse and can sometimes improve them, although some problems may remain Talk to your doctor about what the condition means, what the implications may be for your health and what treatment you may need. Symptoms of Chiari I malformations Many people with a Chiari I malformation will not have any symptoms. Sometimes they're only found after an (MRI) scan of the brain is carried out for another reason. If symptoms do develop, they can include: headaches \u2013 these are usually felt at the back of the head and may be brought on or made worse by coughing, straining, sneezing or bending over neck pain dizziness and balance problems muscle weakness numbness or tingling in the arms or legs blurred vision, double vision and sensitivity to light swallowing problems hearing loss and tinnitus feeling and being sick difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and depression If you develop syringomyelia, you may also experience problems using your hands, difficulty walking, pain, and problems with bladder or bowel control. If you've been diagnosed with a Chiari malformation, you should contact your doctor for advice if you develop any new symptoms or your symptoms worsen. Treatments for Chiari I malformations Treatment for Chiari I malformation depends on whether you have any symptoms and how severe they are. You might not need any treatment if you don't have any symptoms. Painkillers can help relieve any headaches and neck pain. If your headaches are severe or you have problems caused by the pressure on your spinal cord (such as movement difficulties), surgery may be recommended. Surgery The main operation for Chiari malformation is called decompression surgery. Under general anaesthetic a cut is made at the back of your head and the surgeon removes a small piece of bone from the base of your skull. They may also remove a small piece of bone from the top of your spine. This will help reduce the pressure on your brain and allow the fluid in and around your brain and spinal cord to flow normally. Read an NHS leaflet about decompression for Chiari malformation (PDF, 111kb). Other procedures that may be necessary include: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) \u2013 a small hole is made in the wall of one of the cavities of the brain, releasing trapped fluid. See treating hydrocephalus for more information. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting \u2013 a small hole is drilled into the skull and a thin tube called a catheter is passed into the brain cavity to drain trapped fluid and relieve the pressure. See treating hydrocephalus for more information. Untethering \u2013 some children with a type 1 Chiari malformation have a tethered spinal cord, which means it is abnormally attached within the spine. Untethering involves separating the spinal cord and releasing tension in the spine. Read an NHS leaflet on tethered spinal cord (PDF, 193kb). Spinal fixation \u2013 some people with Chiari I will have a hypermobility syndrome, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and may require surgery to stabilise their spine. The aim of surgery is to stop existing symptoms getting any worse. Some people also experience an improvement in their symptoms, particularly their headaches. However, surgery sometimes results in no improvement or symptoms getting worse. There's also a small risk of serious complications, such as paralysis or a stroke. Talk to your surgeon about the different surgical options and what the benefits and risks of each are. Causes of Chiari I malformations The exact cause of Chiari I malformations is unknown. It tends to be present from birth, but is normally only found in adulthood when symptoms develop or when an MRI scan is done. Many cases are thought to be the result of part of the skull not being large enough for the brain. Chiari I malformations can also develop in people with a tethered spinal cord, a build-up of fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus), and some types of brain tumour. Chiari malformations can sometimes run in families. It's possible that some children born with it may have inherited a faulty gene that caused problems with their skull development. But the risk of passing a Chiari malformation on to your child is very small. And remember: even if your children do inherit it, they may not experience symptoms. Information about you If you have been affected by a Chiari malformation, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Types of lupus There are some types of lupus that just affect the skin \u2013 such as discoid lupus erythematosus and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Some medications can also cause lupus-like side effects. However, the term \"lupus\" is most often used to describe a more severe form of the condition called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can affect many parts of the body, including the skin, joints and internal organs. Symptoms range from mild to severe, and many people will have long periods with few or no symptoms before experiencing a sudden flare-up, where their symptoms are particularly severe. Even mild cases can be distressing and have a considerable impact on a person\u2019s quality of life. The rest of this article will focus on SLE. Signs and symptoms SLE can cause a wide range of symptoms, depending on the areas of the body that are affected. The most common symptoms are: fatigue (extreme tiredness) rashes \u2013 particularly on the face, wrists and hands joint pain and swelling As the symptoms of SLE can be similar to a number of other conditions, many of which are more common, it can be difficult to diagnose. If you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by SLE, you should see your GP so they can try to determine the cause. Read more about the symptoms of lupus and diagnosing lupus.  What causes lupus? SLE is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system. For reasons not yet understood, the immune system in people with SLE starts to attack and inflame healthy cells, tissue and organs. As with other more common autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, it is thought a combination of genetic and environmental factors may be responsible for triggering SLE in certain people. Read more about the causes of lupus. Who is affected SLE is an uncommon condition that is estimated to affect around 15,000 people in England and Wales. Around 90% of cases occur in women. The condition is most common in women of childbearing age (between the ages of 15 and 50), but it can also affect people of other ages. The condition tends to be less common in people of white European origin and more common in those of African, Caribbean or Asian origin. How lupus is treated There is currently no cure for SLE, but there are different medications that can help relieve many of the symptoms and reduce the chances of organ damage. These medications include: hydroxychloroquine \u2013 a medicine that has historically been used to treat malaria, but can also help treat some symptoms of SLE corticosteroids \u2013 anti-inflammatory medications immunosuppressants \u2013 a group of medicines that suppress your immune system With good levels of support from friends, family and healthcare professionals, many people with SLE are able to manage their condition effectively.

As a result of early diagnosis and advances in treatment, however, the outlook for SLE is now much better. The vast majority of people diagnosed with the condition will have a normal or near-normal life expectancy. However, some people with SLE are still at risk of life-threatening complications as a result of damage to internal organs and tissues, such as heart attack or stroke. SLE, and some of the treatments for it, can also increase your risk of developing potentially serious infections. Read more about the complications of lupus. Information about you If you have SLE, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Systemic lupus erythematosus can affect the internal organs as well as the skin  Drug-induced lupus There are many medications known to cause lupus-like side effects in some people. These include the antipsychotic chlorpromazine and the antibiotic minocycline. Stopping the course of medication will usually help resolve symptoms of drug-induced lupus, although you should not suddenly stop taking any prescribed medication without first checking with your GP or specialist.
