It typically causes affected joints to become inflamed (swollen), stiff and painful. Between one and two in every five people with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis. It usually develops within 10 years of psoriasis being diagnosed, although some people may experience problems with their joints before they notice any symptoms affecting their skin. Like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is thought to occur as a result of the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue, but it's not clear why some people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis and others don't. Signs and symptoms The pain, swelling and stiffness associated with psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint in the body, but the condition often affects joints including the hands, feet, knees, neck, spine and elbows. The severity of the condition can vary considerably from person to person. Some people may have severe problems affecting many joints, whereas others may only notice mild symptoms in one or two joints. There may be times when your symptoms improve (known as remission) and periods when they get worse (known as flare-ups or relapses). Relapses can be very difficult to predict, but can often be managed with medication when they do occur. When to seek medical advice You should speak to your GP if you experience persistent pain, swelling or stiffness in your joints \u2013 even if you haven't been diagnosed with psoriasis. If you have been diagnosed with psoriasis, you should have check-ups at least once a year to monitor your condition. Make sure you let your doctor know if you are experiencing any problems with your joints. Diagnosing psoriatic arthritis If your doctor thinks you may have arthritis, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in joint conditions) for an assessment. A rheumatologist will usually be able to diagnose psoriatic arthritis if you have psoriasis and problems with your joints, and other types of arthritis \u2013 such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis \u2013 have been ruled out. A number of tests may be carried out to help confirm a diagnosis, including blood tests to check for signs of inflammation in your body and the presence of certain antibodies found in other types of arthritis, as well as X-rays or scans of your joints. Treating psoriatic arthritis The main aims of treatment will be to relieve your symptoms, slow the progression of the condition and improve your quality of life. For most people, this will involve trying a number of different medications, some of which can also treat the psoriasis. Ideally, you should take one medication to treat both your psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis whenever possible. The main medications used to treat psoriatic arthritis are summarised below. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Your GP may first prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to see if they help relieve pain and reduce inflammation. There are two types of NSAIDs and they work in slightly different ways: traditional NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, naproxen or diclofenac COX-2 inhibitors (often called coxibs), such as celecoxib or etoricoxib Like all medications, NSAIDs can have side effects, but your doctor will take precautions to reduce the risk of these, such as prescribing the lowest dose necessary to control your symptoms for the shortest time possible. If side effects do occur, they usually affect the stomach and intestines, and can include indigestion and stomach ulcers. A medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that helps protect your stomach by reducing the amount of acid it produces will therefore often be prescribed alongside NSAIDs. Read more about the side effects of NSAIDs. If NSAIDs alone are not helpful, some of the medications below may be recommended. Steroid medication (corticosteroids) Like NSAIDs, corticosteroids can help reduce pain and swelling.  If you have a single inflamed or swollen joint, your doctor may inject the medication directly into the joint. This can offer rapid relief with minimal side effects, and the effect can last from a few weeks to several months. Corticosteroids can also be taken as a tablet, or as an injection into the muscle, to help lots of joints. However, doctors are generally cautious about this because the medication can cause significant side effects if used in the long term, and psoriasis can flare up when you stop using it. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are medications that work by tackling the underlying causes of the inflammation in your joints. They can help to ease your symptoms and slow the progression of psoriatic arthritis. The earlier you start taking a DMARD, the more effective it will be. Leflunomide is often the first drug given for psoriatic arthritis. Sulfasalazine or methotrexate may be considered as alternatives. You can click on the above links for more information on these medications, including the side effects. It can take several weeks or months to notice a DMARD working. Therefore, it is important to keep taking the medication, even if it doesn't seem to be working at first. Biological treatments Biological treatments are a newer form of treatment for psoriatic arthritis. You may be offered one of these treatments if: your psoriatic arthritis has not responded to at least two different types of DMARD you are not able to be treated with at least two different types of DMARD Biological drugs work by stopping particular chemicals in the blood from activating your immune system to attack the lining of your joints. Some of the biological medicines you may be offered are adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, infliximab and golimumab injections. See our page on treating psoriasis for more information about these medications. The most common side effect of biological treatments is a reaction in the area of skin where the medication is injected, such as redness, swelling or pain, although these reactions aren\u2019t usually serious. However, biological treatments can sometimes cause other side effects, including problems with your liver, kidneys or blood count, so you will usually need to have regular blood or urine tests to check for these. Biological treatments can also make you more likely to develop infections, so you should tell your doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of an infection, such as a sore throat, a high temperature (fever), or diarrhoea. Biological medication will usually be recommended for three months at first, to see if it helps. If it is effective, the medication can be continued. Otherwise, your doctor may suggest stopping the medication or swapping to an alternative biological treatment. Complementary therapies There is not enough scientific research evidence to say that complementary therapies, such as balneotherapy (bathing in water containing minerals), works in treating psoriatic arthritis. There is also not enough evidence to support taking any kind of food supplement as treatment. Complementary therapies can sometimes react with other treatments, so you should talk to your GP, specialist or pharmacist if you are thinking of using any. Managing related conditions As with psoriasis and other types of inflammatory arthritis, you may be more likely to get some other conditions \u2013 such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) \u2013 if you have psoriatic arthritis. CVD is the term for conditions of the heart or blood vessels, such as heart disease and stroke. Your doctor should carry out tests each year (such as blood pressure and cholesterol tests) so they can check whether you have CVD and offer additional treatment, if necessary. You can also help yourself by: having a good balance between rest and regular physical activity losing weight, if you are overweight not smoking only drinking moderate amounts of alcohol Read more about living with psoriasis and preventing CVD. Your care team As well as your GP and a rheumatologist, you may also be cared for by: a specialist nurse \u2013 who will often be your first point of contact with your specialist care team a dermatologist (skin specialist) \u2013 who will be responsible for treating your psoriasis symptoms a physiotherapist \u2013 who can devise an exercise plan to keep your joints mobile an occupational therapist \u2013 who can identify any problems you have in everyday activities and find ways to overcome or manage these a psychologist \u2013 who can offer psychological support if you need it Outlook Like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is a long-term condition that can get progressively worse. In severe cases, there is a risk of the joints becoming permanently damaged or deformed, which may require surgical treatment. However, with an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, it is possible to slow down the progression of the condition and minimise or prevent permanent damage to the joints. Psoriatic arthritis often affects the joints in the hands  Joint pain Joint pain is a very common problem with many possible causes, but it's usually the result of injury or arthritis Page last reviewed: 10\/09\/2014 Next review due: 10\/09\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The flakes are often noticeable if they fall from your scalp on to your shoulders. Your scalp may also feel dry and itchy. It's not contagious and doesn't usually pose a threat to health, but can be unpleasant and embarrassing. Dandruff can range from mild to severe. What causes dandruff? The body continually sheds dead skin cells as new cells are formed. In most cases, this is a gradual process that goes unnoticed. However, this process can speed up, producing excessive amounts of dead skin cells, which causes dandruff. It's not always clear why this happens, but possible causes include seborrhoeic dermatitis (see below), a common skin condition that causes oily skin. While not directly responsible, certain things can make your dandruff worse, such as: overuse of hair products emotional stress washing your hair too much or too little Read more about the causes of dandruff. Seborrhoeic dermatitis If your dandruff is associated with the skin condition seborrhoeic dermatitis, you may also experience additional symptoms. These can include scaling and itching of the skin. Areas of the body most commonly affected include: the scalp the face in and around the ears the front of the chest and between the shoulder blades areas where the skin folds together, such as your armpits, groin and inner thighs The scaling can range from some mild pink patching to widespread thick crusts of skin. In some cases the scales can become infected, which can lead to the patches becoming red, painful and discharging pus and fluid. Severe cases of patching on your scalp can result in some degree of hair loss. However, if there is no scarring, the hair should regrow. Treating dandruff The main treatment is anti-dandruff shampoo. There are a number of different types available over the counter from most pharmacists and supermarkets. These work in different ways, depending on the type, so if one type isn't effective you may want to try another one. If treatment fails to clear your flaky scalp after a few weeks, or your scalp is particularly itchy, see your GP. You may need stronger prescription shampoo or a short course of a steroid lotion. Dandruff usually responds well to treatment, but it's common for it to reoccur. Some people find they are free from symptoms for a while before having a \"flare-up\", where symptoms are particularly bad. In some cases, you may need to use anti-dandruff shampoo on a regular or semi-regular basis to prevent dandruff returning. Read more about the treatment of dandruff. When to see your GP See your GP if your symptoms show no signs of improvement after using anti-dandruff shampoo for two weeks. You may require stronger prescription treatment. Your GP can examine your scalp to rule out skin conditions such as seborrhoeic dermatitis or psoriasis, which may also require prescription treatment. If your GP thinks a fungal infection may be present in your scalp (for example, scalp ringworm), a skin sample may be taken and sent to a laboratory for testing. Who is affected Dandruff is a common condition. It is estimated that half of all people will be affected by dandruff at some point in their lives. Dandruff often occurs after puberty and is most common in people in their early 20s, continuing into middle age. It has been reported that dandruff is more common in men than women. It is thought to affect all ethnic groups equally. Cradle cap Babies can develop yellow, greasy, scaly patches on their scalp. This is known as cradle cap. Cradle cap appears most often in babies in the first two months and tends to last only a few weeks or months. It usually clears up by the age of two, although in rare cases children can have cradle cap a lot longer. Read more about treating cradle cap.

In some cases, so-called 'date rape drugs' may be used to spike a drink before a sexual assault. Many more incidents happen abroad or go unreported due to embarrassment or memory loss. Read on or go straight to: Tips on avoiding drink spiking What to do if you think your drink has been spiked What to do if you've been sexually assaulted following drink spiking Is drink spiking illegal? Who is at risk from spiked drinks? Drink spiking can occur anywhere that drinks are available, including pubs, nightclubs, house parties, restaurants and at home.   It\u2019s not only women who are targeted. In 2012, Essex Police reported that 11% of drink spiking incidents involved men. Drink spiking may be done with the intent of stealing from the victim, assaulting the victim or as a prank. Whatever the reason, drink spiking is illegal and can result in a maximum of 10 years in prison for anyone who is found guilty. If an assault, rape or robbery has also taken place, the sentence will be even higher. Sexual assault is an act that is carried out without the victim\u2019s active consent. This means they didn\u2019t agree to it, even if they have taken drugs or alcohol voluntarily. Read more about rape and sexual assault. What substances are used to spike drinks? Alcohol is the most common substance used to spike drinks. It can be added to a soft (non-alcoholic) drink without you knowing, or double measures can be used instead of singles. Drugs used in drink spiking are often referred to as \"date rape drugs\", although they are not always used for sexual assault. Some examples of drugs that have reportedly been used for drink spiking include: gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) tranquillisers, most often benzodiazepines, including Valium (diazepam) and Rohypnol ketamine Date rape drugs are particularly dangerous when mixed with alcohol, because they combine to have a very powerful anaesthetic effect. In extreme cases, it can lead to a coma or even death. Date rape drugs may come in powder, tablet or liquid form, and don\u2019t always have an unusual taste or smell. See the A-Z of drugs on the Talk to Frank website for more information about illegal substances and their effects. How do I know if my drink has been spiked? Most date rape drugs take effect within 15-30 minutes and symptoms usually last for several hours. However, if you pass out it will be hard to know the full effect. You may still feel some of the symptoms of a date rape drug after a night\u2019s sleep. Although your symptoms will depend on which substance has been used, they usually include some of the following: lowered inhibitions difficulty concentrating or speaking loss of balance and finding it hard to move visual problems, particularly blurred vision memory loss (amnesia) or \"blackouts\" feeling confused or disorientated, particularly after waking up (if you've been asleep) paranoia (a feeling of fear or distrust of others) hallucinations (seeing, hearing or touching things that aren't there) or having an \"out of body\" experience nausea and vomiting unconsciousness How to avoid drink spiking If your drink has been spiked, it's unlikely that you will see, smell or taste any difference. Some drugs, such as GHB, may taste slightly salty or smell unusual. If you start to feel strange or more drunk than you should be, get help immediately. Binge drinking, where you drink lots of alcohol in a short space of time, can increase the risk of having your drink spiked or being the victim of a sexual assault.  Try to avoid drinking too much alcohol, especially in unfamiliar situations. You could lose control, make risky decisions and become less aware of danger. The following steps may also help prevent drink spiking: Never leave your drink unattended and keep an eye on your friends' drinks. Don't accept a drink from someone you don't know. Consider sticking to bottled drinks and avoiding punch bowls or jugs of cocktails. Don't give out your address to someone you've just met. If you think your drink has been tampered with, don't drink it \u2013 tell a trusted friend or relative immediately. Before going out, let someone know where you're going and what time you expect to be home. Make plans for your journey home. Avoid taking expensive equipment with you or anything that could be a target for thieves. If you are travelling abroad, be aware of the local area and where you can find help. Some bars provide plastic stopper devices, such as lids to put on bottles, which can reduce the risk of your drink being spiked. However, these stoppers won't stop you consuming a drink that has been spiked with additional alcohol. They may also provide kits to test your drink, but these don\u2019t test for every kind of drug and often don't work. What should I do if I think my drink has been spiked? First, tell someone you completely trust, such as: a close friend a relative a medical professional the police If you aren't with anyone, call someone you trust and get to a safe place. Ask to use a phone if yours has been stolen. If you need urgent help, call 999. Be wary of accepting help from a stranger and don\u2019t leave with someone you don\u2019t know. If you feel unwell, someone you trust should take you to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Tell the medical staff that you think your drink has been spiked.  Arrange for a trusted friend or relative to take you home and stay with you until the drugs have fully left your system. Report it to the police as soon as you can. They may ask you to provide blood and urine samples. Most drugs leave the body within 72 hours of being taken (the date rape drug GHB leaves the body within 12 hours), so it's important to be tested as soon as possible. If you are abroad, get help from a travel representative, local medical services or ask a bar or hotel manager to call local police. You can also find contact details for the British Embassy, High Commission or Consulate on GOV.UK. Physical assault and robbery following a spiked drink If you have been physically assaulted, robbed, or both, you should report this to the police. They will want any information you have about your attackers, such as: if you knew them what they looked like the circumstances that led to the attack what happened during the attack what was taken The police will need to keep a record of your injuries, and you may need to receive medical treatment. If you've been sexually assaulted following drink spiking Find your nearest sexual assault referral centre If you have been sexually assaulted, you should get medical attention as soon as possible. You may need tests to determine whether you have any sexually transmitted infections (STIs), or whether you are pregnant. You don't have to report an attack to the police immediately if you don't want to. You can contact any of the following places for advice, treatment or referral to a specialist service (such as a forensic examination): a sexual assault referral centre; find your nearest sexual assault referral centre a doctor or practice nurse at your GP surgery a voluntary organisation, such as Rape Crisis the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre national freephone helpline on 0808 802 9999 (12-2.30pm and 7-9.30pm every day of the year) a hospital accident and emergency (A&E) department a genitourinary medicine (GUM) or sexual health clinic a contraceptive clinic a young people\u2019s service NHS 111 Any forensic evidence that is obtained during tests can be stored while you decide whether to report the attack to the police.

It can have many possible causes, including conditions such as narcolepsy, sleep apnoea or restless legs syndrome; severe sleep deprivation; depression; certain medications (such as tranquillisers); or drug and alcohol misuse. However, some people with hypersomnia will not have an underlying medical condition and there will be no obvious explanation for it \u2013 they have it throughout the day, despite sleeping for a very long time at night. This is known as \"idiopathic\" or primary hypersomnia. The rest of this page focuses on idiopathic hypersomnia.  Signs and symptoms People with idiopathic hypersomnia struggle to stay awake during the day and are usually compelled to take frequent long naps. These may be prolonged or at inappropriate times \u2013 such as during a conversation or meal, or even while driving \u2013 and generally don't provide any relief from the sleepiness. Most people with idiopathic hypersomnia also sleep for more than 10 hours a night and struggle to wake in the morning, because they feel very drowsy and confused upon waking (\"sleep drunkenness\"), although some people sleep for a regular amount of time (about eight hours) and are able to wake relatively normally. The excessive sleepiness may have a negative impact on the person's work, relationships and social life, and they may also: have mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression  have low energy be restless or agitated think or speak slowly have trouble remembering things or maintaining concentration perform behaviours around the house as if on \u201Cautopilot\u201D These symptoms often develop during adolescence or in a person's early twenties, although they can occur earlier or later in life. What to do See your GP if you're constantly drowsy during the day and it's affecting your everyday life. They'll want to know about your sleeping habits, how much sleep you get at night, if you wake during the night, and whether you fall asleep during the day. They will also want to know if you have any emotional problems, such as depression, or if you're taking any medication that could explain your hypersomnia. Your GP may also suggest keeping a diary of your sleeping patterns and sleepiness levels for a few weeks, or filling in a questionnaire called the Epworth sleepiness scale to assess whether you're excessively sleepy during the day. If necessary, your GP can refer you to a doctor specialising in sleep disorders for tests to help diagnose the cause of your symptoms. Seeing a sleep specialist A number of tests can be carried out to assess your sleep and help identify any underlying cause. These are usually carried out at a specialist sleep centre. Two of the main tests used are: Polysomnography (a night time sleep test), which will help rule out sleep disorders such as narcolepsy or sleep apnoea. You stay in a special bedroom and are observed from another room through the night. Electrodes are attached to your face, head and body to record brainwaves, muscle activity, eye movement, breathing and snoring.  Multiple sleep latency test \u2013 this test usually follows the next day. You'll be asked to take several naps throughout the day, so doctors can see how long it takes you to fall asleep when instructed (this shouldn't take longer than eight minutes for someone with hypersomnia). Doctors may diagnose idiopathic hypersomnia if you have excessive daytime sleepiness and need regular daytime naps, but no other cause is found. Managing idiopathic hypersomnia Idiopathic hypersomnia doesn't usually get better by itself. Many people find that the symptoms improve with treatment. Medication There are no medicines specifically designed to treat idiopathic hypersomnia, but medications used for narcolepsy can often help. The main medications used are stimulants, such as modafinil, dexamphetamine and methylphenidate, which help to keep you awake during the day. See treating narcolepsy for more information on these medicines. Antidepressants may be prescribed if emotional problems are interfering with your sleep. A medicine called flumazenil has been shown to help some patients with idiopathic hypersomnia, although more research is needed to be sure of its effectiveness. Lifestyle changes It may also help to adopt good sleeping habits, such as avoiding alcohol, caffeine and medications that make the condition worse, sticking to a bedtime routine, and avoiding working at night or engaging in social activities that delay bedtime. Idiopathic hypersomnia or narcolepsy? Idiopathic hypersomnia is similar to narcolepsy, in that both cause excessive daytime sleepiness and can mean you fall asleep at virtually any time, but there are some key differences:  In narcolepsy, you may lose muscle control when experiencing strong emotions (cataplexy) \u2013 this does not happen in idiopathic hypersomnia. People with narcolepsy often have very vivid dreams and even hallucinations when they are drowsy, which are generally not seen in idiopathic hypersomnia. The overnight sleep in narcolepsy is usually very fragmented and of poor quality, but people with idiopathic hypersomnia tend to sleep continuously through the night. Short daytime naps in narcolepsy tend to be refreshing, but naps in idiopathic hypersomnia are more like long sleeps and are not refreshing. In idiopathic hypersomnia, you don't tend to fall quickly into rapid eye movement (REM) or dream sleep, which is often a key feature in narcolepsy.

The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland found in the neck. It produces hormones that are released into the bloodstream to control the body's growth and metabolism. They affect processes such as heart rate and body temperature, and help convert food into energy to keep the body going. There are several different types of thyroiditis. The common types are: Hashimoto's thyroiditis (the most common) de Quervain's or subacute thyroiditis  post-partum thyroiditis (triggered after giving birth) silent or painless thyroiditis  drug-induced thyroiditis  radiation-induced thyroiditis  acute or infectious thyroiditis  The symptoms and treatment of these conditions are briefly described below.  Hashimoto's thyroiditis  Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition. This means your immune system mistakenly attacks your thyroid gland, causing it to gradually swell and become damaged. As the thyroid gland is slowly destroyed over time, it is unable to produce sufficient amounts of thyroid hormone. The medical term for low levels of thyroid hormone in the blood is hypothyroidism. This leads to symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland, which are very general and can include: fatigue weight gain constipation dry skin depression The swollen thyroid gland may also cause a lump to form in your throat, known as a goitre. It may take months or even years for the condition to be detected, because the disease progresses very slowly. The cause of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is not understood, but it sometimes appears to run in families, suggesting your genes may make you more likely to develop the condition. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is also associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as Addison's disease and type 1 diabetes. It is usually seen in women aged 30 to 50.  Hashimoto's thyroiditis cannot be cured, so the low levels of thyroid hormone are usually permanent. However, the symptoms are often easily treated with the thyroid hormone replacement medication levothyroxine, which is usually taken for life. Surgery is only rarely needed, for instance if your goitre is particularly uncomfortable  or there are suspicions of cancer. Read about treating an underactive thyroid gland and treating goitre. De Quervain's (subacute) thyroiditis  De Quervain's thyroiditis (sometimes called subacute thyroiditis) is a painful swelling of the thyroid gland that is thought to be triggered by a viral infection, such as mumps or the flu.  It's most commonly seen in females aged 20 to 50. De Quervain's thyroiditis usually causes a fever and pain in the neck, jaw or ear. It can also cause your thyroid gland to release too much thyroid hormone into the blood (thyrotoxicosis), leading to symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), including: anxiety insomnia heart palpitations weight loss irritability The palpitations and shakes associated with thyrotoxicosis can be treated with a beta-blocker. The pain caused by de Quervain\u2019s thyroiditis can often be relieved with painkillers such as aspirin, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen. In the cases where these medications are ineffective, corticosteroid medication may be prescribed. De Quervain\u2019s thyroiditis settles down after a few days and is often followed by a spell of hypothyroidism lasting a few weeks or months, before the thyroid gland recovers completely. Very occasionally, the condition may recur or the low levels of thyroid hormones caused by it can be permanent and may require long-term treatment with thyroid hormone replacement medication. Post-partum thyroiditis  Like Hashimoto's thyroiditis, post-partum thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition, but it only happens in women who have recently given birth. In post-partum thyroiditis, your immune system attacks your thyroid gland within around six months of giving birth, causing a temporary rise in thyroid hormone levels (thyrotoxicosis) and symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland. Then, after a few weeks, your thyroid gland becomes depleted of thyroid hormone, leading to low levels of thyroid hormone and symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland. However, not every woman with post-partum thyroiditis will go through both these phases.  If low thyroid hormone levels are causing severe symptoms, you may need to take thyroid hormone replacement until the condition gets better. In most women with the condition, thyroid function returns to normal within 12 months after the baby is born, although the low thyroid hormone levels can sometimes be permanent. Silent (painless) thyroiditis  Silent thyroiditis is very similar to post-partum thyroiditis. It is also an autoimmune condition, but is not related to giving birth and can occur in both men and women. Like postpartum thyroiditis, there may be a phase of high thyroid hormone levels (thyrotoxicosis), causing symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland. This may then be followed by a phase of symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland, before the symptoms eventually go away within around 12 to 18 months. If low thyroid hormone levels are causing severe symptoms, you may need to take thyroid hormone replacement until the condition gets better. In a few cases, the low thyroid levels can be permanent. Drug-induced thyroiditis  Thyroiditis can also be triggered by medications including interferon, amiodarone, lithium and a class of drugs to treat certain cancers (which include sunitinib), if these medicines damage the thyroid gland. There may be symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland or symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland, but these are usually short-lived and may get better after you stop taking the medication causing the condition. However, you should not stop taking any medication that has been prescribed for you without first discussing it with your doctor. Drug-induced thyroiditis can sometimes cause pain in the area around the thyroid gland. This can often be relieved with NSAIDs, although corticosteroid medication may occasionally be needed. Radiation-induced thyroiditis  Radioactive iodine treatment for an overactive thyroid gland or radiotherapy for certain cancers can also damage the thyroid gland, leading to symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland or symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland. The low levels of thyroid hormone after radioactive iodine is usually permanent, and may cause symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland that will need to be managed with lifelong thyroid hormone replacement treatment.  Acute or infectious thyroiditis  Acute or infectious thyroiditis is usually triggered by a bacterial infection. It is rare and is associated with either a weakened immune system or, in children, with a problem in the development of the thyroid. Symptoms may include pain in the throat, feeling generally unwell, swelling of the thyroid gland and sometimes symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland or symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland. These symptoms will usually get better when the infection is treated with antibiotics. In the meantime, thyroid pain can often be managed with NSAIDs. Children will usually require an operation to remove the abnormal part of the thyroid.

It's also sometimes called \"dual sensory loss\" or \"multi-sensory impairment\". A deafblind person won't usually be totally deaf and totally blind, but both senses will be reduced enough to cause significant difficulties in everyday life. These problems can occur even if hearing loss and vision loss are mild, as the two senses work together and one would usually help compensate for loss of the other. Signs of deafblindness Deafblindness most commonly affects older adults, although it can affect people of all ages, including babies and young children. In older people, it may develop gradually and the person themselves may not realise their vision and\/or hearing is getting worse at first. Signs of a problem can include: needing to turn up the volume on the television or radio difficulty following a conversation not hearing noises such as a knock at the door asking others to speak loudly, slowly and more clearly needing to hold books or newspapers very close, or sitting close to the television difficulty moving around unfamiliar places If someone already has either a hearing or vision problem, it's important to look out for signs that suggest the other sense may be getting worse too. Read more about the symptoms of deafblindness. Seeing your GP Visit your GP if you think your hearing and\/or eyesight may be getting worse. If you're worried about a friend or family member, encourage them to speak to their GP. It's best to seek advice as soon as possible, as treatment for some underlying causes of deafblindness (see below) can be more effective if started early. Early diagnosis will also ensure the person is able to access local support services sooner. Read more about diagnosing and assessing deafblindness. What causes deafblindness? There are many potential causes of deafblindness. Some babies are born deafblind, but in many cases the hearing and\/or vision loss occurs later in life. Causes of deafblindness include: age-related hearing loss genetic conditions, such as Usher syndrome an infection picked up during pregnancy, such as rubella (German measles) cerebral palsy \u2013 a problem with the brain and nervous system that mainly affects movement and co-ordination eye problems associated with increasing age, such as cataracts Read more about the causes of deafblindness. Living with deafblindness A range of care and support services is available to help deafblind people. Each deafblind person will have a different level of hearing and sight loss, which means they'll have their own individual care needs. The general aims of care for a deafblind person are to: preserve and maximise any remaining sight or hearing the person has \u2013 this could involve treating underlying conditions like cataracts, wearing glasses or using a hearing aid teach alternative methods of communication \u2013 such as hand on hand signing or braille help retain or develop as much independence as possible \u2013 for example, by training the person to use a long cane, a guide dog or offering a communicator guide Your local authority should arrange an assessment to determine exactly what care and support is needed. Read more about managing deafblindness. Help and support Sense is another UK-based charity that provides advice and support for deafblind people. Their helpline numbers are 0300 330 9256 and 020 7520 0972 (same numbers for textphone). Alternatively, their email address is: info@sense.org.uk.

Action on Hearing Loss estimates that there are more than 10 million (about 1 in 6) people in the UK with some degree of hearing impairment or deafness. Hearing loss can occur suddenly, but usually develops gradually. General signs of hearing loss can include: difficulty hearing other people clearly and misunderstanding what they say asking people to repeat themselves listening to music or watching television with the volume turned up higher than other people require Read more about the symptoms of hearing loss. When to see your GP See your GP if you're having problems with your hearing, or your child is showing signs of hearing difficulty. If you lose your hearing suddenly, in one or both ears, you must see your GP as soon as possible. Your GP can check for any problems and may refer you to an audiologist (hearing specialist) or an ENT surgeon for further tests. You can also visit the Action on Hearing Loss website for an online hearing test. Read more about diagnosing hearing loss. Why it happens Hearing loss is the result of sound signals not reaching the brain. There are two main types of hearing loss, depending on where the problem lies: sensorineural hearing loss \u2013 caused by damage to the sensitive hair cells inside the inner ear or damage to the auditory nerve; this occurs naturally with age or as a result of injury conductive hearing loss \u2013 when sounds are unable to pass from your outer ear to your inner ear, often because of a blockage such as earwax, glue ear or a build-up of fluid from an ear infection, or because of a perforated ear drum or disorder of the hearing bones It's also possible to have both these types of hearing loss. This is known as mixed hearing loss. Some people are born with hearing loss, but most cases develop as you get older.  Read more about causes of hearing loss. Preventing hearing loss It isn't always possible to prevent hearing loss if you have an underlying condition that causes you to lose your hearing. However, there are several things you can do to reduce the risk of hearing loss from long-term exposure to loud noise. This includes not having music or the television on at a loud volume at home and using ear protection at loud music events or in noisy work environments. You should also see your GP if you have signs of an ear infection, such as flu-like symptoms, severe earache, discharge or hearing loss. Read more about preventing hearing loss. Treating hearing loss The way hearing loss is treated depends on the cause and how severe it is. In cases of sensorineural hearing loss, there are several options that may help to improve a person\u2019s ability to hear and communicate. These include: digital hearing aids \u2013 which are available through the NHS bone anchored implants \u2013 suitable for people who are unable to use hearing aids and for some levels of sensorineural hearing loss middle ear implants \u2013 suitable for some people who are unable to use hearing aids cochlear implants \u2013 for people who find hearing aids aren't powerful enough lip reading and\/or sign language \u2013 such as British Sign Language (BSL) Conductive hearing loss is sometimes temporary and can be treated with medication or minor surgery, if necessary. However, more major surgery may be required to fix the ear drum or hearing bones. If conventional hearing aids don't work, there are also some implantable devices for this type of hearing loss, such as a Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHAs). Read more about treating hearing loss. How hearing works Sound waves enter your ear and cause your eardrum to vibrate. These vibrations are passed to the three small bones (ossicles) inside your middle ear. The ossicles amplify the vibrations and pass them on to your inner ear where tiny hair cells inside the cochlea (the coiled, spiral tube inside the inner ear) move in response to the vibrations and send a signal through a nerve called the auditory nerve to the brain.

They can help ease the symptoms of conditions such as colds and flu, hay fever and other allergic reactions, and sinusitis. They work by reducing the swelling of the blood vessels in your nose, which helps open up the airways. This page covers: Types of decongestants Who can take decongestants How to use decongestants Side effects of decongestants Interactions with other medications Types of decongestants Decongestants are available as: nasal sprays tablets or capsules liquids or syrups flavoured powders to dissolve in hot water Some products may just contain decongestant medication, but many are sold as \"all in one\" remedies that contain decongestants, painkillers and\/or antihistamines. Most decongestants can be bought over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription. Who can take decongestants Most people can use decongestants safely, but they're not suitable for everyone. They shouldn't be used by the following groups of people without getting advice from a pharmacist or GP first: babies and children \u2013 decongestants shouldn't be given to children under six years old and should only be used by children aged 6-12 on the advice of a GP or pharmacist pregnant and breastfeeding women \u2013 it's not clear whether it's safe to take decongestants if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, so you should only use them if advised by a healthcare professional people taking other medications (see Interactions with other medications below) people with diabetes people with high blood pressure people with an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) men with an enlarged prostate people with liver, kidney, heart or circulation problems people with glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye) The patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine will state who shouldn't use it and who should seek advice before using it. How to use decongestants Most decongestants should only be used three or four times a day. Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for advice about how much to take and how often to take it. If you're unsure, ask a pharmacist for advice. Decongestant nasal sprays shouldn't be used for more than a week at a time because using them for too long can make your stuffiness worse. Speak to your GP if your symptoms fail to improve after this time. Side effects of decongestants Decongestant medicines don't usually have side effects, and any side effects you may experience are usually mild. Possible side effects can include: irritation of the lining of your nose headaches feeling or being sick a dry mouth feeling restless or agitated a rash uncontrollable shaking (tremor) problems sleeping (insomnia) a rapid and\/or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) noticeable heartbeats (palpitations) in men, difficulty passing urine These side effects should pass after you stop taking the medication. More serious side effects can also occur, such as hallucinations and severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), but these are very rare. Interactions with other medications Seek advice from a pharmacist or GP before taking decongestants if you're taking other medications. Decongestants can increase or decrease the effect of some other medications. For example, taking decongestants alongside a type of antidepressant called a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) can cause a dangerous rise in blood pressure. It's also important to be wary of taking other medications if you're using an \"all in one\" decongestant remedy. These products contain additional painkillers and\/or antihistamines, so it could be dangerous to take extra separate doses of these medicines at the same time.

DVT usually occurs in a deep leg vein, a larger vein that runs through the muscles of the calf and the thigh. It can cause pain and swelling in the leg and may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism. This is a serious condition that occurs when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream and blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs (see below). DVT and pulmonary embolism together are known as venous thromboembolism (VTE). Symptoms of DVT In some cases, there may be no symptoms of DVT. If symptoms do occur they can include: pain, swelling and tenderness in one of your legs (usually your calf) a heavy ache in the affected area warm skin in the area of the clot red skin, particularly at the back of your leg below the knee DVT usually (although not always) affects one leg. The pain may be worse when you bend your foot upward towards your knee. Pulmonary embolism If left untreated, about one in 10 people with a DVT will develop a pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary embolism is a very serious condition which causes: breathlessness \u2013 which may come on gradually or suddenly chest pain \u2013 which may become worse when you breathe in sudden collapse  Both DVT and pulmonary embolism require urgent investigation and treatment. Seek immediate medical attention if you have pain, swelling and tenderness in your leg and you develop breathlessness and chest pain. Read more about the complications of DVT. What causes DVT? Each year, DVT affects around one person in every 1,000 in the UK. Anyone can develop DVT, but it becomes more common over the age of 40. As well as age, there are also a number of other risk factors, including: having a history of DVT or pulmonary embolism having a family history of blood clots being inactive for long periods \u2013 such as after an operation or during a long journey blood vessel damage \u2013 a damaged blood vessel wall can result in the formation of a blood clot having certain conditions or treatments that cause your blood to clot more easily than normal \u2013 such as cancer (including chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment), heart and lung disease, thrombophilia and Hughes syndrome being pregnant \u2013 your blood also clots more easily during pregnancy being overweight or obese The combined contraceptive pill and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) both contain the female hormone oestrogen, which causes the blood to clot more easily. If you're taking either of these, your risk of developing DVT is slightly increased. Read more about the causes of DVT. Diagnosing DVT See your GP as soon as possible if you think you may have DVT \u2013 for example, if you have pain, swelling and a heavy ache in your leg. They'll ask you about your symptoms and medical history. D-dimer test It can be difficult to diagnose DVT from symptoms alone, so your GP may advise that you have a specialised blood test called a D-dimer test. This test detects pieces of blood clot that have been broken down and are loose in your bloodstream. The larger the number of fragments found, the more likely it is that you have a blood clot in your vein. However, the D-dimer test isn't always reliable because blood clot fragments can increase after an operation, injury or during pregnancy. Additional tests, such as an ultrasound scan, will need to be carried out to confirm DVT. Ultrasound scan An ultrasound scan can be used to detect clots in your veins. A special type of ultrasound called a Doppler ultrasound can also be used to find out how fast the blood is flowing through a blood vessel. This helps doctors identify when blood flow is slowed or blocked, which could be caused by a blood clot. Venogram A venogram may be used if the results of a D-dimer test and ultrasound scan can't confirm a diagnosis of DVT. During a venogram, a liquid called a contrast dye is injected into a vein in your foot. The dye travels up the leg and can be detected by X-ray, which will highlight a gap in the blood vessel where a clot is stopping the flow of blood. Treating DVT Treatment for DVT usually involves taking anticoagulant medicines, which reduce the blood's ability to clot and stop existing clots getting bigger. Heparin and warfarin are two types of anticoagulant often used to treat DVT. Heparin is usually prescribed first because it works immediately to prevent further clotting. After initial treatment, you may also need to take warfarin to prevent another blood clot forming. A number of anticoagulants, known as directly acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), may also be used to treat conditions such as DVT. These medications include rivaroxaban and apixaban, and they've been shown to be as effective as heparin and warfarin with less serious side effects. You'll also be prescribed compression stockings to wear every day, which will improve your symptoms and help prevent complications. Read more about treating DVT. Preventing DVT If you need to go into hospital for surgery, a member of your care team will assess your risk of developing a blood clot while you're there. If you're at risk of developing DVT, there are a number of things you can do to prevent a blood clot occurring, both before you go into hospital, such as temporarily stopping taking the combined contraceptive pill, and while you're in hospital, such as wearing compression stockings. When you leave hospital, your care team may also make a number of recommendations to help prevent DVT returning or complications developing. These may include: not smoking eating a healthy, balanced diet taking regular exercise  maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if you're obese There's no evidence to suggest that taking aspirin reduces your risk of developing DVT. See your GP before embarking on long-distance travel if you're at risk of getting a DVT, or if you've had a DVT in the past. When taking a long-distance journey (six hours or more) by plane, train or car, you should take steps to avoid getting DVT, such as drinking plenty of water, performing simple leg exercises and taking regular, short walking breaks.

It's estimated that around 25,000 people who are admitted to hospital die from preventable blood clots each year. The Department of Health has made the prevention of DVT a priority across the NHS. All patients admitted to hospital should be assessed for their risk of developing a blood clot and, if necessary, given preventative treatment. This recommendation was made by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2010. For more information, see the NICE guidance about venous thromboembolism: reducing the risk for patients in hospital.

When the normal water content of your body is reduced, it upsets the balance of minerals (salts and sugar) in your body, which affects the way it functions. Water makes up over two-thirds of the healthy human body. It lubricates the joints and eyes, aids digestion, flushes out waste and toxins, and keeps the skin healthy. Some of the early warning signs of dehydration include: feeling thirsty and lightheaded a dry mouth tiredness having dark coloured, strong-smelling urine passing urine less often than usual A baby may be dehydrated if they: have a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head have few or no tears when they cry have fewer wet nappies are drowsy The body is affected even when you lose a small amount of fluid. Read more about the symptoms of dehydration. What causes dehydration? Dehydration is usually caused by not drinking enough fluid to replace what we lose. The climate, the amount of physical exercise you are doing (particularly in hot weather) and your diet can contribute to dehydration. You can also become dehydrated as a result of an illness, such as persistent vomiting and diarrhoea, or sweating from a fever. Read more about the causes of dehydration. Who is at risk from dehydration? Anyone can become dehydrated, but certain groups are particularly at risk. These include: babies and infants \u2013 they have a low body weight and are sensitive to even small amounts of fluid loss older people \u2013 they may be less aware that they are becoming dehydrated and need to keep drinking fluids people with a long-term health condition \u2013 such as diabetes or alcoholism athletes \u2013 they can lose a large amount of body fluid through sweat when exercising for long periods  What to do If you're dehydrated, drink plenty of fluids such as water, diluted squash or fruit juice. These are much more effective than large amounts of tea or coffee. Fizzy drinks may contain more sugar than you need and may be harder to take in large amounts. If you're finding it difficult to keep water down because you're vomiting, try drinking small amounts more frequently. Infants and small children who are dehydrated shouldn't be given large amounts of water alone as the main replacement fluid. This is because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body too much and lead to other problems. Instead, they should be given diluted squash or a rehydration solution (available from pharmacies). You might find a teaspoon or syringe can be helpful for getting fluid into a young child. If left untreated, severe dehydration can be serious and cause fits (seizures), brain damage and death. Read more about treating dehydration. When to see your GP See your GP if your symptoms continue, despite drinking plenty of fluids, or if you think your baby or toddler is dehydrated. If your GP suspects dehydration, you may have a blood test or a urine test to check the balance of salts (sodium and potassium) in your body. Contact your GP, out-of-hours service or NHS 111 straight away if you have any of the following symptoms: extreme thirst feeling unusually tired (lethargic) or confused not passing urine for eight hours rapid heartbeat dizziness when you stand up that doesn't go away after a few seconds You should also contact your GP if your baby has had six or more episodes of diarrhoea in the past 24 hours, or if they have vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours.  How much should I drink? Studies have tried to establish a recommended daily fluid intake, but it can vary depending on the individual and factors such as age, climate and physical activity. A good rule is to drink enough fluid so that you're not thirsty for long periods, and to steadily increase your fluid intake when exercising and during hot weather. Passing clear urine (wee) is a good sign that you're well hydrated. You should drink plenty of fluid if you have symptoms of dehydration, such as feeling thirsty and lightheaded, or passing dark-coloured urine. It is also important to replace fluid lost after an episode of diarrhoea.  Page last reviewed: 13\/04\/2015 Next review due: 13\/04\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

A simple test for confusion is to ask the person their name, age and today's date, and see if they seem unsure or answer incorrectly. It's understandable to fear the worst and assume it's a sign of dementia \u2013 but if the confusion came on over a short period of time (acute confusion), dementia is unlikely to be the sole cause. Read on to find out: what to do if someone is showing signs of confusion common causes of sudden confusion more unusual causes of sudden confusion What to do if someone is showing signs of confusion If the confusion has come on suddenly, take them to your nearest hospital or call 999 for an ambulance, especially if they're showing other signs of illness such as a fever, or their skin or lips are turning blue. If the person is diabetic... If the person is diabetic, check their blood sugar level. You can check this if they have a testing device with them. You'll need to prick their finger with the device and place the droplet of blood on the testing strip. Compare the reading with these target blood sugar levels. If the reading is high, take them to hospital or call 999. If the reading is low, give them a sugary snack or drink. Wait 10 minutes to see if they recover. If they don't, take them to hospital or call 999. While you wait for the ambulance Stay with them. Introduce yourself if you need to, reassure them, and remind them where they are at regular intervals. Check the person's medication cupboard \u2013 if in their home \u2013 and make a note of what drugs they're taking. Ask if any other family members have been unwell, to check whether carbon monoxide poisoning could be a possible cause of the confusion.

Dementia is a progressive neurological disease which affects multiple brain functions, including memory. The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is unknown, although a number of things are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: increasing age a family history of the condition previous severe head injuries lifestyle factors and conditions associated with cardiovascular disease It's becoming increasingly understood that it's very common to have both changes of Alzheimer's and vascular dementia together (mixed dementia). Read more about the causes of Alzheimer's disease. Signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition, which means the symptoms develop gradually and become more severe over the course of several years. It affects multiple brain functions. The first sign of Alzheimer's disease is usually minor memory problems. For example, this could be forgetting about recent conversations or events, and forgetting the names of places and objects. As the condition develops, memory problems become more severe and further symptoms can develop, such as: confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places difficulty planning or making decisions problems with speech and language problems moving around without assistance or performing self-care tasks personality changes, such as becoming aggressive, demanding and suspicious of others hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there) and delusions (believing things that are untrue) low mood or anxiety Read more about the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Who is affected? Alzheimer's disease is most common in people over the age of 65, and affects slightly more women than men. The risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia increases with age, affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80. However, around 1 in every 20 cases of Alzheimer's disease affects people aged 40 to 65. Receiving a diagnosis As the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease progress slowly, it can be difficult to recognise that there's a problem. Many people feel that memory problems are simply a part of getting older. However, a timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can give you the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment or support that may help. If you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it's a good idea to see your GP. If you're worried about someone else, you should encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them. There's no single test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Your GP will ask questions about any problems you are experiencing and may do some tests to rule out other conditions. If Alzheimer's disease is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist memory service to:   discuss the process of making the diagnosis organise testing  create a treatment plan   Read more about diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. How Alzheimer's disease is treated There's no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but medication is available that can help relieve some of the symptoms and slow down the progression of the condition in some people. Various other types of support are also available to help people with Alzheimer's live as independently as possible, such as making changes to your home environment so it's easier to move around and remember daily tasks. Psychological treatments such as cognitive stimulation therapy may also be offered to help support your memory, problem solving skills and language ability. Read more about treating Alzheimer's disease. Outlook On average, people with Alzheimer's disease live for around 8 to 10 years after they start to develop symptoms. However, this can vary considerably from person to person. Some people with the condition will live longer than this, but others will not. Alzheimer's disease is a life-limiting illness, although many people diagnosed with the condition will die from another cause. As Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a progressive neurological condition, it can cause problems with swallowing. This can lead to aspiration (food being inhaled into the lungs) which can cause frequent chest infections. It's also common for people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease to eventually have difficulty eating and to have a reduced appetite.  There's increasing awareness that people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease need palliative care. This includes support for families, as well as the person with Alzheimer's. Can Alzheimer's disease be prevented? As the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease isn't clear, there's no known way to prevent the condition. However, there are things you can do that may reduce your risk or delay the onset of dementia, such as: stopping smoking and cutting down on alcohol eating a healthy, balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight staying physically fit and mentally active These measures have other health benefits, such as lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease and improving your overall mental health.

Carers' support groups Media last reviewed: 24\/05\/2016 Next review due: 24\/05\/2019 If you have dementia, or you are looking after someone who has dementia, you are likely to face many practical issues in your daily life. People with dementia can feel vulnerable as their condition progresses and they increasingly rely on other people to do things for them. It is important that people who have dementia feel reassured and supported, while retaining some level of independence.  For more information, read staying independent with dementia. Although some symptoms are common to many people with dementia, each person's experience of the disease and how they cope with it will be different. Helping someone with dementia with everyday tasks When a person with dementia finds that their mental abilities are declining, they're likely to feel anxious, stressed and scared. They may be aware of their increasing clumsiness and inability to remember things, and this can be very frustrating and upsetting for them. If you are looking after someone with dementia, you can help them feel more secure by creating a regular daily routine in a relaxed environment, where they're encouraged and not criticised. Involving the person you look after in everyday tasks may make them feel useful and improve their sense of self-worth. They could help with the shopping, laying the table or sweeping leaves in the garden, for example. As the illness progresses, these tasks may become harder for them to manage independently, and you may need to give them more support. How you can help The main way you can help someone with dementia is by offering support sensitively and try not to be critical of what they do. It can be very important for the person with dementia to feel that they're still useful. In the early stages, memory aids can be used around the home to help the person remember where things are. For example, you could put pictures on cupboard doors of what's inside, such as cups and saucers. This may help to trigger their memory and enable them to retain their independence a little longer. Keeping up hobbies and interests when someone has dementia Many people with dementia will still enjoy their hobbies or interests. For example, if they like cooking, they may be able to help make a meal. Going for a walk or gardening is a simple way to get some exercise and a sense of achievement. Or they may prefer listening to music or playing a board game. Caring for a pet cat or dog can bring a lot of pleasure to some people. If the person you care for was very sociable and outgoing, or if they have a large family, they may really enjoy visits from one or two family members or friends. However, they may struggle to keep up with conversations if they have a lot of visitors at the same time. You can find tips and ideas for people with dementia in this activities guide from Care UK (PDF, 1Mb). Maintaining good health and nutrition in someone with dementia It's important that the person you care for has a healthy, balanced diet and gets some exercise. The longer they stay fit and healthy, the better their quality of life will be. If you want some easy exercises, try these sitting exercises.  If the person you care for doesn't eat enough or eats unhealthy food, they can become susceptible to other illnesses. People with dementia can become more confused if they get ill. Common food-related problems for people with dementia include: not recognising foods forgetting what food they like refusing or spitting out food resisting being fed asking for strange food combinations This behaviour is usually due to confusion, or irritation in the mouth caused by dental problems, rather than wanting to be awkward. If you're concerned about the person's eating behaviour, speak to your GP. How you can help Involve the person you care for. For example, if they cannot feed themselves, you could put the cutlery in their hand and help guide it to their mouth. You could also involve them in preparing food, if they are able to. Try to stay calm. If you feel stressed at mealtimes, the person you care for will probably be stressed too. Make sure you have plenty of time for meals, so you can deal with any problems that arise. Try to accommodate behaviour changes. It's likely that the person you care for will change their eating patterns and habits over time. Being aware of this and trying to be flexible will make mealtimes less stressful for both of you. If you think the person you care for may have health or dental problems, get help from your GP or dentist. You could also contact a local carers' group to speak to other people who may have experienced similar difficulties. If the person with dementia smokes, replace matches with disposable lighters to lower the risk of them accidentally causing a fire. If the person you care for drinks alcohol, check if this is recommended alongside any medication they make take. If in doubt, ask your GP. Dealing with incontinence in someone with dementia Incontinence can be difficult to deal with and can be very upsetting for the person you care for. It's common for people with dementia to experience incontinence. This can be due to urinary tract infections, constipation causing added pressure on the bladder, or medication. A person with dementia may also simply forget to go to the toilet, or may forget where the toilet is. They may also have lost the ability to tell when they need the toilet. How you can help It's important to be understanding, retain a sense of humour and remember that it's not their fault. You may also want to try the following: Put a sign on the toilet door, such as a photo of the toilet. Keep the toilet door open and make sure that the person you care for can access it easily. Make sure they can remove their clothes \u2013 some people with dementia can struggle with buttons and zips. Look out for signs that they may need to go to the toilet, such as fidgeting and standing up and down. Get adaptations to the toilet if necessary \u2013 you may be able to get these through a care and support needs assessment. If you're still having problems with incontinence, ask your GP to refer you to a continence advisor, who can advise on things like waterproof bedding or incontinence pads. Helping someone with dementia with their personal hygiene People with dementia can become anxious about certain aspects of personal hygiene and may need help with washing. For example, they may be scared of falling when getting out of the bath, or they may become disorientated in the shower. The person you care for may not want to be left alone or they may resist washing, because they find the lack of privacy undignified and embarrassing. Try to do what's best for them. Read more about personal hygiene for people who are cared for. Helping someone with dementia sleep well People with dementia often experience disturbed sleep. They may wake up during the night or be restless. These problems may get worse as the illness progresses. People with dementia may also have painful illnesses such as arthritis that cause, or contribute to, sleep problems. Some medication can cause sleepiness during the day and interfere with sleep at night. Sleeping pills can be used with care in people with dementia. However, \"sleep hygiene\" measures are best for people with dementia \u2013 for example, no naps during the day, regular bedtimes, and avoiding alcohol or caffeine at night. Read more about sleeping well. Taking care of your own wellbeing If you or a family member has dementia, you may find it difficult to stay positive. Remember that you are not alone, and that help and support is available. Talk to someone about your worries. This could be a family member or friend, a member of your local dementia support group, or your GP can refer you to a counsellor in your area. It is important for a carer's physical health and psychological wellbeing that they are able to take a break (respite) from care. Carers may also need respite care if they have to go into hospital or meet other important commitments. Friends, relatives and neighbours can provide respite care at home. You can also arrange home respite care through home care agencies or, in some areas, your local authority. Care away from home can confuse some people with dementia, both while they are away and when they come back. If you decide on respite care away from the person's home, it is a good idea to visit beforehand to check that it meets the needs of the person with dementia. Caring for someone with dementia can be frustrating and stressful at times, but there are many organisations that can help. For more details, call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053. Lines are open 9am-8pm Monday to Friday and 11am-4pm on weekends. Reading Well Books on Prescription for dementia offers support for people diagnosed with dementia and their relatives and carers. GPs and other health professionals can recommend titles from a list of 25 books on dementia. The books are available for anyone to borrow for free from their local library.

The term \"dementia\" describes a loss of mental ability (cognitive impairment) associated with gradual death of brain cells. It's rare in anyone younger than 65. Symptoms usually develop gradually and become more severe over the course of several years. Signs and symptoms People with dementia with Lewy bodies not only experience problems with memory and judgement, like those with Alzheimer's disease, but are also likely to have difficulties with concentration and visual perception (recognising objects and making judgements about where they are in space). They may experience: slowed movement, stiff limbs, and tremors recurrent visual hallucinations (seeing things that aren't there) sleep disturbances, including sleepiness during the day fainting, unsteadiness, and falls People with the condition tend to swing from a state of alertness to drowsiness or staring into space. These extreme changes may be unpredictable and happen from hour to hour or day to day. Read more about the symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies. What causes dementia with Lewy bodies? Dementia with Lewy bodies is caused by deposits of an abnormal protein called Lewy bodies inside brain cells. These deposits, which are also found in people with Parkinson\u2019s disease, build up in areas of the brain responsible for things such as memory and muscle movement. It's not clear why the deposits develop and how exactly they damage the brain, but it's thought they disrupt the brain's normal functions by interfering with chemical signals transmitted from one brain cell to another. Dementia with Lewy bodies usually occurs in people with no family history of the condition, although there have been reports of rare cases that seem to run in families. Diagnosing dementia with Lewy bodies If you think you may have early symptoms of dementia, it's a good idea to see your GP. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment, and perhaps suggest that you go along with them. Your GP can do some simple checks to see if there is chance you could have dementia, and they can refer you to a memory clinic or another specialist clinic if necessary. At one of these clinics, you will be asked about your symptoms and have a physical check-up and memory test. You may also have blood tests and brain scans. The results of these checks and tests will give your doctor a good idea as to whether your symptoms are caused by dementia with Lewy bodies, another type of dementia, or something else entirely. Read more about how dementia with Lewy bodies is diagnosed. How dementia with Lewy bodies is managed There is no cure for dementia with Lewy bodies or any medication that will slow it down. However, a few different medicines can be effective in controlling some of the symptoms. In particular, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (used to treat Alzheimer's disease) have been shown to improve symptoms such as hallucinations and confusion in some people. Supportive treatments \u2013 such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy \u2013 can help improve any problems with movement, everyday tasks, and communication. Psychological therapies and specific dementia activities, such as memory cafés, can also help with memory loss, confusion, and feelings of disorientation. Read more about treating dementia with Lewy bodies.  Outlook How quick dementia with Lewy bodies progresses varies from person to person. Home-based help will be needed, and some people will eventually need residential care in a nursing home. The average survival after the time of diagnosis is similar to that of Alzheimer's disease \u2013 around five to eight years. However, as with Alzheimer's disease, this can be highly variable. If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, remember that you are not alone. The NHS, social services, and voluntary organisations will be able to provide advice and support to help you and your family.

The term \"dementia\" describes a loss of mental ability (cognitive impairment) that is more than would be expected with ageing. It's enough to affect day-to-day activities and gets progressively worse. Frontotemporal dementia tends to affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain (the front and sides) in particular. These parts of the brain are largely responsible for language and the ability to plan and organise, and are important in controlling behaviour. Frontotemporal dementia often starts at a younger age than usually seen in other types of dementia. Most cases are diagnosed in people aged 50-65, but it can also affect younger or older people. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of frontotemporal dementia vary at first, depending on the exact area of the brain affected. Generally, it causes slowly progressive problems with behaviour, language and thinking. It can profoundly alter a person's character \u2013 for example, they may become impulsive and much more outgoing, or uninterested and lacking initiative. Other typical symptoms include inappropriate behaviour in social situations and progressive difficulty with speech and language. Read more about the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia. What causes frontotemporal dementia?  There are several different causes of frontotemporal dementia, but they all involve a build-up of abnormal proteins in the brain. The abnormal proteins clump together and become toxic to the brain cells, which eventually kills them and causes the affected areas of the brain to shrink over time. It's not fully understood why these abnormal proteins build up, but there is often a genetic link. Up to 40% of people with frontotemporal dementia have a family history of the condition. Diagnosing frontotemporal dementia See your GP if you think you may have early symptoms of dementia. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest going along with them. Your GP can do some simple checks to see if there is a chance you could have dementia, and they can refer you to a specialist if necessary. The specialist will carry out a physical check-up and an assessment of your mental abilities. You may also have blood tests and brain scans. The results of these checks and tests will give your doctor a good idea as to whether your symptoms are caused by frontotemporal dementia, another type of dementia, or something else entirely.

However, there are treatments and therapies that can help to reduce some of the symptoms. For example, antidepressants may be effective in controlling some of the behavioural problems. Support such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy help people adapt to lost functions. Dementia activities such as \"memory cafes\" and some psychological therapies can help with managing the symptoms. Read more about treating frontotemporal dementia.  Outlook Frontotemporal dementia gets progressively worse, usually over a number of years. People with the condition can become isolated and socially withdrawn as the illness progresses. They may not want to spend time in the company of others, or when in company, may lack empathy and concern for others, or behave in rude or insulting ways. Some lack the motivation to care for themselves and may need supervision and prompting. Home-based help is often needed, and some people will eventually need residential care in a nursing home. The average survival time after symptoms start is around eight years, although this can vary significantly. Many people with the condition live with it for 10 years or more. If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, you are not alone. The NHS, social services and voluntary organisations can provide advice and support to help you and your family.

The term dementia describes a loss of mental ability (cognitive impairment) associated with gradual death of brain cells. It's rare in anyone younger than 65. Signs and symptoms Many cases of vascular dementia start with early warning signs, including slight: slowness of thought difficulty with planning trouble with language problems with attention and concentration mood or behavioural changes See your GP if you notice these signs. If it's spotted at an early stage, lifestyle changes and treatment may be able to stop the vascular dementia getting worse, or at least slow its progression. Left untreated, your symptoms may continue to get worse. Read more about the symptoms of vascular dementia. What causes vascular dementia? Vascular dementia is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, which damages and eventually kills the brain cells.  This can develop as a result of: narrowing and blockage of the small blood vessels deep inside the brain (known as small vessel disease) a single large stroke (where the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly cut off) lots of mini-strokes that cause tiny, but widespread, damage to the brain In many cases, these problems are linked to underlying health conditions \u2013 such as high blood pressure and diabetes \u2013 as well as lifestyle factors, such as smoking and being overweight. This may mean tackling these things might reduce your risk of vascular dementia in later life, as well as other serious problems such as strokes, although it's not yet clear exactly how much your risk of dementia can be reduced. Read more about the causes of vascular dementia. Diagnosing vascular dementia See your GP if you think you may have early symptoms of dementia. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and maybe suggest you go along with them. Your GP can do some simple checks to see if there is a chance you could have dementia, and they can refer you to a specialist if necessary. The specialist will carry out a physical check-up and an assessment of your mental abilities. You may also have blood tests and brain scans. The results of these checks and tests will give your doctor a good idea as to whether your symptoms are caused by vascular dementia, another type of dementia, or something else entirely. Read more about the diagnosis of vascular dementia. How vascular dementia is managed There is no specific treatment for vascular dementia and no way to reverse the damage to the brain that has already occurred. However, treatment may help slow down the progression of the condition. Medicines and lifestyle changes will be recommended to tackle the underlying cause, such as high blood pressure. This includes: eating healthily losing weight, if you are overweight stopping smoking, if you smoke getting fit cutting down on alcohol Support such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy can help people regain lost functions, and dementia activities such as memory cafés and some psychological therapies can help manage symptoms. Read more about treating vascular dementia. Outlook The symptoms of vascular dementia will usually get steadily worse over time. This often happens in sudden steps, with relatively stable periods in between, although it's difficult to predict when these steps will happen. Although treatment can help, vascular dementia can significantly shorten life expectancy. The average survival time from diagnosis is around four years.

Simply find a dental practice that's convenient for you, whether it's near your home or work, and phone them to see if any appointments are available. If you do not have a regular dental practice or are new to the area, you can search for a NHS dentist near you on this site. Be aware that not all dental practices will have the capacity to take on new NHS patients all the time and you may have to join a waiting list or contact multiple practices before you find a NHS dentist with capacity to accept new patients. You should also be aware that even if you filled in a registration form at your first visit to the practice, so that the dentist can add you to their patient database, that does not mean that you have guaranteed access to a new NHS dental appointment in the future. If the dentist\u2019s quota for NHS patients has been reached by the time you contact the practice you may not be offered an NHS appointment. In that case you can either choose to be seen privately, join a waiting list or look for a different dentist who is taking on new NHS patients. If after contacting several dental practices you still can\u2019t find a dentist accepting NHS patients, you should contact your local NHS England Area team, which should be able to tell you about available dentists in your area. NHS England commissions dental services in England and by doing so is required to meet the needs of their local population, for both urgent and routine dental care. If you feel dissatisfied with the way NHS England handled your concern, you have the right to complain. First, tell NHS England you are not happy with the service provided. Details of how to contact NHS England and what information to provide is given in the NHS complaints procedure. If you're still not satisfied with NHS England's response, you can take your complaint to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.  Dental emergency and out-of-hours care If you require urgent treatment, please contact your usual dental practice as they may be able to see you or direct you to an urgent care dental service. If you do not have a regular dentist, contact NHS 111 for advice on where you can get urgent care. Emergency dental treatment will deal with the problem at hand and the fee for the treatment is currently £19.70. You may be advised to make another appointment for a separate course of non-urgent treatment. In this case, you will have to pay a second charge in the relevant treatment band.

This is the first part of each course of NHS treatment and is included in the Band 1 (£19.70) charge. You do not have to register with a dentist in the same way as with a GP to receive NHS treatment. Therefore, you should not be asked to have an examination or pay for any private work before being accepted by an NHS dentist. If you haven\u2019t seen a dentist for several years because of fear or anxiety, read our tips to ease fear of the dentist. Read about your dental team for an overview of the different professionals you may see at your dental practice. At your check-up, your dentist will assess your current oral health, any risk of future disease, and advise you on the care and treatment required to secure good oral health. It is important that you try to keep your teeth healthy and clean to maintain good oral health. At your check-up, your dentist may: carry out a full examination of your mouth, teeth and gums ask about your general health and any problems you have had with your teeth, mouth or gums since your last visit ask about and give advice on your diet, smoking and drinking ask about your teeth-cleaning habits and give you advice on the most appropriate ways to keep your mouth, teeth and gums healthy explain any risks, as well as costs, of all treatment you may need discuss with you when your next visit should be You don't necessarily need to see your dentist every six months. Your dentist will recommend how often you should come to see them, based on your current dental health. If you have problems with your teeth between check-ups, contact your dental practice to make an earlier appointment. Find out about emergency dental care. The dental treatment plan If your dentist recommends a Band 2 or Band 3 dental treatment, you'll be given a personal dental treatment plan (PDF, 19kb) in advance. This outlines all the treatments you are having on the NHS and how much they will cost. If you are not given a treatment plan, ask for one. Treatment plans are usually not given for Band 1 dental treatments, but you can ask for one if you like. If your dentist says you need a particular type of treatment, you should not be asked to pay for it privately. Where alternative private options have been discussed, then those options should be listed on your treatment plan. Separate details of private treatment and charges \u2013 usually on the same form as your NHS treatment plan \u2013 should always be provided in writing before you commit to it. If this isn't done, query this immediately with the practice or make an official complaint. You'll be asked to sign the plan and you'll be given a copy to keep. If you're unhappy about agreeing to your treatment plan or signing it, you have the right to say no to all or any of the recommended treatments. You also have the right to seek a second opinion from another dentist. However, you will have to pay another Band 1 fee for this new consultation. If you decide not to proceed with a certain treatment option then inform your dentist. Likewise the dentist should inform you of any necessary changes to the treatment plan. A dentist may suggest a different treatment sometimes on further investigation or due to changes in your oral health following the initial assessment. Any changes to treatment should be discussed and agreed with you. If your dentist tries to change that course of treatment without your agreement, query this immediately with the practice or make an official complaint.   Missed appointments If you know you will not be able to attend an appointment then please give as much notice as possible to the dental practice so they can cancel your appointment and offer your slot to another patient. Your dentist can terminate your treatment if you miss your appointment without letting the dental practice know. You may then need to pay again for a new course of treatment. While surgeries can\u2019t charge you for not turning up, NHS England has the right to ask you to find another dental practice if you continue to miss appointments. Information you should find at your dental practice When you visit your dental practice, the following should be clearly displayed: a poster about current NHS charges the surgery's complaints procedure a written statement about how the surgery meets the requirements for infection control, health and safety, X-rays and continuing professional development of dentists In addition, you should be given a leaflet about the surgery and its services. If you cannot find any of the information, you have the right to ask for it. What your dentist should not do Your dentist should not: offer NHS treatment to children on condition that a parent or guardian becomes a private patient suggest that NHS treatment is sub-standard make you pay privately for an examination to assess whether you will be accepted for NHS treatment charge you for missed appointments for NHS treatment While surgeries can\u2019t charge you for not turning up, NHS England, has the right to ask you to find another dental practice if you continue to miss appointments.  Share: Save: Print: Page last reviewed: 26\/01\/2015 Next review due: 26\/01\/2017 Form FP17 Everyone visiting an NHS dentist is required to sign the patient declaration on the FP17 form.

However, some people may not be able to get to their dental practice because of a disability or medical condition. In this case, the dentist should refer the patient to a more specialised dental service. Ask your dentist what is needed for a referral and if it is suitable in your case. Specialised dental services are commonly provided by community dental services. Community dental services are available in a variety of places to ensure everyone can have access to dental health. These include hospitals, specialist health centres and mobile clinics as well as home visits or visits in nursing and care homes. Some hospitals or health centres also help people who need specialist care and may be able to offer treatment under sedation or general anaesthetic. People who may need community dental services include: children with extensive untreated tooth decay who are particularly anxious or uncooperative children with physical or learning disabilities or medical conditions children referred for specific treatment children who are 'looked after' or on the 'at risk register' adults with complex needs who have a proven difficulty in accessing or accepting care in general dental services, including adults with moderate and severe learning and physical disabilities or mental health problems adults with medical conditions who need additional dental care housebound and homeless people To find out more about the community dental care available in your area, contact your local NHS England Area Team. Tips for your appointment If you are referred to a specialist dental service ensure your dentist is forwarding all necessary documents. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask detailed questions about anything you don\u2019t understand about your treatment or the costs involved. If necessary let the dentist explain it to your carer or family member.   If you have specific medical requirements, for example medication allergies, or fears make a note of it and tell your dentist at your first appointment.

It\u2019s caused by a bacterial infection. An abscess at the end of a tooth is called a periapical abscess. An abscess in the gum is called a periodontal abscess. Dental abscesses are often painful, but aren\u2019t always. In either case, they should be looked at by a dentist. It's important to get help as soon as possible, because abscesses don't go away on their own. They can sometimes spread to other parts of the body and make you ill. This page covers: Symptoms of a dental abscess What to do if you have a dental abscess Relieving your symptoms Treatments for a dental abscess What causes dental abscesses? Preventing dental abscesses Symptoms of a dental abscess Symptoms of an abscess in your tooth or gum may include: an intense, throbbing pain in the affected tooth or gum that may come on suddenly and gets gradually worse pain that spreads to your ear, jaw and neck on the same side as the affected tooth or gum pain that's worse when lying down, which may disturb your sleep redness and swelling in your face a tender, discoloured and\/or loose tooth shiny, red and swollen gums sensitivity to hot or cold food and drink bad breath and\/or an unpleasant taste in your mouth If the infection spreads, you may also develop a high temperature (fever) and feel generally unwell. In severe cases, you may find it hard to fully open your mouth and have difficulty swallowing or breathing. What to do if you have a dental abscess You should see a dentist as soon as possible if you think you have a dental abscess. Avoid visiting your GP, as there is little they can do to help. You can get help from: your registered dentist \u2013 if it's out of hours, they should have an answerphone message with details of how to access out-of-hours dental treatment NHS 111 \u2013 who can give you details of dental services in your area your local clinical commissioning group (CCG) \u2013 who can tell you the phone number of your local dental access helpline your local accident and emergency (A&E) department \u2013 if there are no other options or you're having difficulty breathing You may have to pay for emergency NHS dental treatment, depending on your circumstances. Read about NHS dental charges. Relieving your symptoms While you're waiting to see a dentist, painkillers can help control your pain. Ibuprofen is the preferred painkiller for dental abscesses, but if you're unable to take it for medical reasons, you can take paracetamol instead. Aspirin shouldn't be given to children under 16. If one painkiller doesn't relieve the pain, taking both paracetamol and ibuprofen at the doses shown in the medicine leaflet may help. This is safe for adults, but not for children under 16. It may also help to: avoid hot or cold food and drink if it makes the pain worse try eating cool, soft foods if possible, using the opposite side of your mouth use a soft toothbrush and temporarily avoid flossing around the affected tooth These measures can help relieve your symptoms temporarily, but you shouldn't use them to delay getting help from a dentist. Treatments for a dental abscess Dental abscesses are treated by removing the source of the infection and draining away the pus. Depending on the location of the abscess and how severe the infection is, possible treatments include: removing the affected tooth (extraction) \u2013 this may be necessary if root canal treatment isn't possible root canal treatment \u2013 a procedure to remove the abscess from the root of an affected tooth before filling and sealing it incision and drainage \u2013 where a small cut (incision) is made in the gum to drain the abscess (this is usually only a temporary solution and further treatment may be needed) Local anaesthetic will usually be used to numb your mouth for these procedures. More extensive operations may be carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're asleep). Antibiotics aren't routinely prescribed for dental abscesses, but may be used if the infection spreads or is particularly severe. What causes dental abscesses? Your mouth is full of bacteria, which form a sticky film on your teeth called plaque. If you don't keep your teeth clean, acids produced by the bacteria in plaque can damage your teeth and gums, leading to tooth decay or gum disease. The following can increase your chances of developing a dental abscess: poor oral hygiene \u2013 plaque can build-up on your teeth if you don't floss and brush your teeth regularly consuming lots of sugary or starchy food and drink \u2013 these can encourage the growth of bacteria in plaque and may lead to decay that can result in an abscess an injury or previous surgery to your teeth or gums \u2013 bacteria can get into any damaged parts of the teeth or gums having a weakened immune system \u2013 this includes people with certain underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, and those having treatment, including steroid medication or chemotherapy  Preventing dental abscesses You can reduce your risk of developing dental abscesses by keeping your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. To do this, you should: use floss or an interdental brush at least once a day to clean between your teeth and under the gum line brush your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste twice a day \u2013 spending at least two minutes each time avoid rinsing your mouth with water or mouthwash after brushing because this washes the protective toothpaste away \u2013 just spit out any excess toothpaste cut down on sugary and starchy food and drinks \u2013 particularly between meals or shortly before going to bed visit your dentist regularly \u2013 your dentist can suggest how often you should have a check-up, based on your oral health  Read more on how to keep your teeth clean and dental check-ups.

The information on this page explains what you may have to pay for your NHS dental treatment. Emergency dental treatment \u2013 £19.70  This covers emergency care in a primary care NHS dental practice such as pain relief or a temporary filling. Band 1 course of treatment \u2013 £19.70 This covers an examination, diagnosis (including X-rays), advice on how to prevent future problems, a scale and polish if clinically needed, and preventative care such as the application of fluoride varnish or fissure sealant if appropriate. Band 2 course of treatment \u2013 £53.90 This covers everything listed in Band 1 above, plus any further treatment such as fillings, root canal work or removal of teeth but not more complex items covered by Band 3. Band 3 course of treatment \u2013 £233.70 This covers everything listed in Bands 1 and 2 above, plus crowns, dentures, bridges and other laboratory work. If you need help with dental charges see our section on Help with health costs. Any treatment that your dentist believes is clinically necessary to achieve and maintain good oral health should be available on the NHS. You will not be charged for individual items within a course of treatment. Depending on what you need to have done, you should only ever be asked to pay one charge for each complete course of treatment, even if you need to visit your dentist more than once to finish it. A course of treatment is finished when your dentist considers good oral health has been achieved. Be aware that being repeatedly late for your treatment sessions or failure to attend appointments may result in the early termination of the course of treatment.    If you get referred to another dentist If you're referred by your dentist for specialist NHS dental work as part of an existing course of treatment, you should only pay one charge. However, if your are referred to another dentist such as for a full course of treatment under sedation then this is generally regarded as a separate course of treatment and you will have to pay a second charge. The amount you need to pay will depend on the treatment you need.      If you have completed a course of treatment and need more treatment If you have completed one course of treatment but you need another treatment, you do not have to pay again if: you need more treatment within the same or a lower charge band (such as another filling) within two months of completing a course of treatment. You need repair work or a replacement for certain types of restoration within a year of the original work being done. You should return to the same dentist. Please note certain conditions apply, which your dentist should discuss with you. When to pay for your NHS treatment Different dental practices have different requirements. Some may ask for the whole payment for your treatment up front, while others will ask you to pay after it has all been completed. Check with your surgery when you come for your initial check-up. How to claim a refund If you think you\u2019ve been charged wrongly or that you've paid too much, talk to your dentist in the first instance. Your dentist will know what work was done and whether it was NHS only or a mix of NHS and private work. The dentist will be able to make the relevant refund if appropriate. For Band 2, Band 3 and any mix of NHS and private treatment, you should have had a dental treatment plan outlining the costs and treatments.   If you paid for NHS treatment but later found out that you were entitled to have it free of charge or to pay a reduced amount, you can claim a refund of the NHS charge. You need to do this within three months of the date that you paid. To find out how to make a refund, read about help with dental costs.   If you are not happy with the way your dentists dealt with your claim then you should follow the  NHS complaints procedure. List of dental treatments by Band All the treatment your dentist believes is clinically necessary to achieve and maintain good oral health is available on the NHS. This means that the NHS provides any treatment you need to keep your mouth, teeth and gums healthy. It does not include treatments such as teeth whitening or veneers, which you might want for cosmetic reasons but which are not clinically necessary. The following list of dental treatments is therefore not a comprehensive list of treatments that all patients are entitled to under NHS services provision. For each individual course of treatment, a dentist will indicate the treatment options that are clinically appropriate for your personal circumstances and based on specific clinical judgement each time. Band 1 course of treatment: £19.70 clinical examination, case assessment and report orthodontic case assessment and report advice, dental charting, diagnosis and treatment planning radiographic examination and radiological report study casts colour photographs instruction in the prevention of dental and oral disease including dietary advice and dental hygiene instruction surface application as primary preventive measures of sealants and topical fluoride preparations scaling, polishing and marginal correction of fillings taking material for pathological examination adjustments to and easing of dentures or orthodontic appliances treatment of sensitive cementum Band 2 course of treatment: £53.90 non-surgical periodontal treatment (gum disease treatment), including root-planing, deep scaling, irrigation of periodontal pockets and subgingival curettage and all necessary scaling and polishing surgical periodontal treatment, including gingivectomy, gingivoplasty or removal of an operculum, raising and replacement of a mucoperiosteal flap, curettage, root planning and bone resection free gingival grafts permanent fillings in amalgam, composite resin, synthetic resin, glass ionomer, compomers, silicate or silico-phosphate, including acid etch retention sealant restorations endodontic treatments (root canal treatment) of permanent or retained deciduous teeth, pulpotomy and apicoectomy extraction of teeth transplantation of teeth oral surgery including surgical removal of cyst, buried root, unerupted tooth, impacted tooth or exostosed tooth and alveolectomy soft tissue surgery in relation to the buccal cavity and lips frenectomy, frenuloplasty, frenotomy relining and rebasing dentures including soft linings addition of tooth, clasp, labial or buccal flange to dentures splints (other than laboratory made splints) in relation to periodontally compromised teeth and in connection with external trauma bite raising appliances (other than laboratory made appliances) Band 3 course of treatment: £233.70 laboratory made porcelain or composite veneers, including acid etch retention inlays, pinlays, onlays and palatal veneers, in alloys containing 60% or more fine gold, porcelain, composite resin and ceramics crowns including any pin or post aids to retention: \u2013 full or three-quarter crown cast in alloys containing not less than 33⅓% fine gold or platinum or palladium \u2013 full or jacket crown cast in alloys containing stainless steel or cobalt chromium or nickel chromium \u2013 crown in porcelain, synthetic resin and other non-metallic crowns \u2013 full or jacket crowns in alloys containing not less than 33⅓% fine gold or platinum or palladium, or alloys containing stainless steel or cobalt chromium or nickel chromium, with thermally bonded porcelain \u2013 jacket crown thermally bonded to wrought platinum coping \u2013 prefabricated full or jacket crown, including any pin or post retention bridges including any pin or post aids to retention: \u2013 bridges in alloys containing 60% or more fine gold with or without thermally bonded facings \u2013 bridges cast in alloys containing stainless steel, cobalt chromium or nickel chromium, with or without thermally bonded facings \u2013 acid etch retained bridges \u2013 bridges in other materials \u2013 provision of full (completed) or partial dentures, overdentures and obturators in synthetic resin or metal or both synthetic resin and metal, including any cast or wrought metal components or aids to retention \u2013 orthodontic treatment and appliances \u2013 other custom made applications excluding sports guards Share: Save: Print: Page last reviewed: 26\/01\/2015 Next review due: 26\/01\/2017 Treatments free of charge You do not have to pay a dental charge: if you are having stiches removed if your dentist has to stop bleeding from your mouth if your dentures need repair. However, if it isn't possible to repair your dentures and you need new ones then you'll have to pay for this with a Band 3 charge   Not available on the NHS The NHS will not provide cosmetic treatments such as teeth whitening, which you may want to make your teeth more attractive, but which are not clinically necessary. Even where treatment is clinically necessary the dentist will offer you a treatment option that is clinically appropriate. If you choose to have alternative treatment options then you will have to pay privately for these.   Paying NHS charges Read about rules on exemptions, claiming refunds, and what happens if you're caught claiming refunds dishonestly Useful links NHS Choices links Find a dentist NHS complaints procedure Dental health advice Common dental questions Dental abscess Dental care for babies and children Dentures (false teeth) Fluoride Gum disease Orthodontics Root canal treatment Toothache Tooth decay Wisdom tooth removal External links General Dental Council NICE NHS England British Dental Health Foundation - dental helpline: 01788 539 780 Download NHS dental charges poster (PDF, 2Mb) NHS dental services leaflet (PDF, 2Mb) Wisdom teeth Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

Simply find a dental practice that's convenient for you, whether it's near your home or work, and phone them to see if any appointments are available. If you do not have a regular dental practice or are new to the area, you can search for a NHS dentist near you on this site. Be aware that not all dental practices will have the capacity to take on new NHS patients all the time and you may have to join a waiting list or contact multiple practices before you find a NHS dentist with capacity to accept new patients. You should also be aware that even if you filled in a registration form at your first visit to the practice, so that the dentist can add you to their patient database, that does not mean that you have guaranteed access to a new NHS dental appointment in the future. If the dentist\u2019s quota for NHS patients has been reached by the time you contact the practice you may not be offered an NHS appointment. In that case you can either choose to be seen privately, join a waiting list or look for a different dentist who is taking on new NHS patients. If after contacting several dental practices you still can\u2019t find a dentist accepting NHS patients, you should contact your local NHS England Area team, which should be able to tell you about available dentists in your area. NHS England commissions dental services in England and by doing so is required to meet the needs of their local population, for both urgent and routine dental care. If you feel dissatisfied with the way NHS England handled your concern, you have the right to complain. First, tell NHS England you are not happy with the service provided. Details of how to contact NHS England and what information to provide is given in the NHS complaints procedure. If you're still not satisfied with NHS England's response, you can take your complaint to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.  Dental emergency and out-of-hours care If you require urgent treatment, please contact your usual dental practice as they may be able to see you or direct you to an urgent care dental service. If you do not have a regular dentist, contact NHS 111 for advice on where you can get urgent care. Emergency dental treatment will deal with the problem at hand and the fee for the treatment is currently £19.70. You may be advised to make another appointment for a separate course of non-urgent treatment. In this case, you will have to pay a second charge in the relevant treatment band.

It can help to prevent tooth decay, which is why it's added to many brands of toothpaste and, in some areas, to the water supply through a process called fluoridation (see below).  Tooth decay Tooth decay, also known as dental decay or dental caries, is a major health concern worldwide and is still a big problem in the UK. Despite being preventable, it's one of the most common reasons for hospital admission in children. Tooth decay is the destruction of tooth tissue caused by acids made by bacteria in dental plaque. Dental plaque is a sticky film that constantly forms on the teeth. Each time you have sugary food and drink, the bacteria in plaque produce acid that attacks teeth. If you eat or drink sugary foods frequently throughout the day, you have more \"acid attacks\" which can lead to tooth decay. This can eventually lead to cavities (holes) in the teeth and infection, which is why teeth sometimes need to be removed. Read more about the causes of tooth decay. Fluoride toothpaste Brushing your teeth thoroughly with fluoride toothpaste is one of the most effective ways of preventing tooth decay. A range of toothpastes are available that contain different levels of fluoride. The amount of fluoride that\u2019s in the toothpaste can be found on the side of the tube and is measured in parts per million (ppm). Toothpastes containing 1350-1500ppm fluoride are the most effective. Your dentist may advise you to use higher-strength toothpaste if you or your child is at particular risk of tooth decay. Children under three years old should brush twice daily, with a smear of toothpaste containing no less than 1000ppm fluoride. Children between three and six years old should brush at least twice daily with a pea-sized amount of toothpaste containing more than 1000ppm fluoride.  Adults should brush at least twice daily with a toothpaste containing 1350-1500ppm fluoride.  Don\u2019t use mouthwash at the same time as brushing. Use it at an alternative time, because it washes away the fluoride in the toothpaste Read more about looking after your baby's teeth, children's teeth, and how to keep your teeth clean. Fluoride dental treatments Fluoride mouth rinses Fluoride mouth rinses can be prescribed for adults and children aged eight and above who have tooth decay. They should be used every day, in addition to brushing twice daily with toothpaste containing at least 1350ppm fluoride. Rinses should be used at different times to brushing to avoid washing the toothpaste off your teeth, as this reduces the beneficial effects of the fluoride in the toothpaste. Fluoride varnish Fluoride varnish can be applied to both baby teeth and adult teeth by a dentist. The process involves painting a varnish containing high levels of fluoride onto the surface of the tooth every six months to prevent decay. It works by strengthening tooth enamel, making it more resistant to decay. From the age of three, children should be offered fluoride varnish treatment at least twice a year. Fluoride varnish should be offered two or more times a year for children of all ages with tooth decay or those at high risk of developing it. Ask your dentist about fluoride varnish. Find a dentist near you. Community water fluoridation Most water supplies contain some fluoride and in the early 20th century, levels of tooth decay were found to be associated with fluoride levels in drinking water. This led to the introduction of water fluoridation schemes to add fluoride to water supplies to improve dental health. Community water fluoridation schemes have operated for over 70 years; the first fluoridation scheme was introduced in the US in 1945. The first substantive UK scheme was established in Birmingham in 1964. Community water fluoridation in England Around 5.8 million people in England receive fluoridated water. This means fluoride has been added to bring it up to around 1mg of fluoride per litre of water, which is a level found to reduce tooth decay levels. The decision about whether to add fluoride to the water supply is made by individual local authorities. Areas where water fluoridation schemes are currently in place include parts of: the West Midlands the North East the East Midlands Eastern England the North West  Yorkshire and Humber In some parts of the country, such as parts of the North East and Midlands, the public water supply naturally contains a level of fluoride that's similar to that seen in schemes. Some private water supplies contain more than this amount. Your local water supplier should be able to tell you how much fluoride is in your water supply and whether any is added. Most companies have an online facility where you can use your postcode to check the water in your area. What research has been carried out? Over the past 50 years, there have been several reviews of the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation schemes. Recent large reviews that have been carried out include: Public Health England: Water fluoridation health monitoring report for England (PDF, 1.51Mb) \u2013 in 2014 (read the NHS Choices coverage of this report) NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination: A systematic review of water fluoridation (PDF, 6.22Mb) \u2013 in 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US): Recommendations on selected interventions to prevent dental caries, oral and pharyngeal cancers and sports-related craniofacial injuries (PDF, 69kb) \u2013 in 2002 National Health and Medical Research Council (Australian Government): Efficacy and safety of fluoridation \u2013 in 2007 US Department of Health and Human Services Community Preventive Services Task Force: Community water fluoridation \u2013 in 2013 Royal Society of New Zealand: Health effects of water fluoridation (PDF, 1Mb) \u2013 in 2014 Health Research Board (Ireland): Health effects of water fluoridation (PDF, 1.58Mb) \u2013 in 2015 Cochrane Oral Health Group: Water fluoridation for the prevention of dental caries \u2013 in 2015 Overall, these reviews found that water fluoridation appears to contribute to reduced tooth decay levels and doesn't seem to be associated with any significant health risks (see below). Is fluoride safe? There have been some concerns that fluoride may be linked to a variety of health conditions. Reviews of the risks (see above) have so far found no convincing evidence to support these concerns. However, a condition called dental fluorosis can sometimes occur if a child's teeth are exposed to too much fluoride when they're developing. Read more about looking after children's teeth. Mild dental fluorosis can be seen as very fine pearly white lines or flecking on the surface of the teeth. Severe fluorosis can cause the tooth's enamel to become pitted or discoloured. It's uncommon in the UK for fluorosis to be severe enough to seriously affect the appearance of teeth. This is because fluoride levels in water are carefully monitored by the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) and adjusted if necessary.

Most adults in the UK have gum disease to some degree and most people experience it at least once. It's much less common in children. If you have gum disease, your gums may bleed when you brush your teeth and you may have bad breath. This early stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis. If gingivitis isn't treated, a condition called periodontitis can develop. This affects more tissues that support teeth and hold them in place. If periodontitis isn't treated, the bone in your jaw may be damaged and small spaces can open up between the gum and teeth. Your teeth can become loose and may eventually fall out. Read more about the symptoms of gum disease. What causes gum disease? Gum disease is caused by a build-up of plaque on the teeth. Plaque is a sticky substance that contains bacteria. Some bacteria in plaque are harmless, but some are harmful for the health of your gums. If you don't remove plaque from your teeth by brushing them, it builds up and irritates your gums. This can lead to redness with bleeding, swelling and soreness. Read more about the causes of gum disease. Seeing your dentist You should make an appointment to see your dentist if your gums are painful, swollen or if they bleed when you brush your teeth. Find a dentist near you. Your dentist can carry out a thorough dental examination to check the health of your gums, which may involve inserting a thin metal stick with a bend in one end (periodontal probe) beside your teeth. In some cases, a number of X-rays may be needed to check the condition of your teeth and jaw bone. Preventing and treating gum disease Mild cases of gum disease can usually be treated by maintaining a good level of oral hygiene. This includes brushing your teeth at least twice a day and flossing regularly. You should also make sure you attend regular dental check-ups. In most cases, your dentist or dental hygienist will be able to give your teeth a thorough clean and remove any hardened plaque (tartar). They'll also be able to show you how to clean your teeth effectively to help prevent plaque building up in the future. If you have severe gum disease, you'll usually need to have further medical and dental treatment and, in some cases, surgery may need to be carried out. This will usually be performed by a specialist in gum problems (periodontics). Read more about treating gum disease and keeping your teeth clean. Dental check-ups It's important to have regular dental check-ups so any problems with your teeth and gums can be detected and treated early. If you've never had gum disease and have good oral health, you may only need to visit your dentist every one to two years for a check-up. You may need to visit your dentist more frequently if you've had problems with gum disease in the past. At each appointment your dentist will advise when you need your next appointment. If you have an increased risk of developing gum problems \u2013 for example, if you smoke or have diabetes \u2013 you may be advised to visit your dentist more often so your teeth and gums can be closely monitored. Complications of gum disease If you have untreated gum disease that develops into periodontitis, it can lead to further complications, such as: gum abscesses (painful collections of pus) receding gums loose teeth loss of teeth Read more about the complications of gum disease. NHS dentists Everyone should be able to access good quality NHS dental services. There's no need to register with a dentist. Simply find a practice that's convenient for you, whether it's near home or work, and phone to see if any appointments are available. Read more about how to find an NHS dentist.

You will only ever be asked to pay one charge for each complete course of treatment, even if you need to visit your dentist more than once to finish it. If you are referred to another dentist for another, separate course of treatment, you can expect a second charge. Some minor treatments are free.  NHS dental charges Band 1 course of treatment \u2013 £19.70 This covers examinations, diagnosis (including radiographs), advice on how to prevent future problems, scale and polish if clinically necessary, and preventative care (e.g. applications of fluoride varnish or fissure sealant). This band also covers emergency care in a primary care dental practice such as pain relief or a temporary filling. Band 2 course of treatment \u2013 £53.90 This covers everything listed in Band 1, plus any further treatment such as fillings, root canal work or if your dentist needs to take out one or more of your teeth. Band 3 course of treatment \u2013 £233.70 This covers everything listed in Bands 1 and 2, plus crowns, dentures, bridges and other laboratory work. Read the section Understanding NHS dental charges for more detailed information.   Who is entitled to free dental care? You do not have to pay for NHS dental treatment if, when the treatment starts, you are: aged under 18 under 19 and receiving full-time education pregnant or have had a baby in the previous 12 months staying in an NHS hospital and your treatment is carried out by the hospital dentist an NHS hospital dental service outpatient (however, you may have to pay for your dentures or bridges). You do not have to pay if, during the course of treatment, you or your partner, receive: Income Support Income-related Employment and Support Allowance Income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance Pension Credit guarantee credit Universal Credit and meet the criteria or you are named on or entitled to a valid NHS tax credit exemption certificate \u2013 if you don't have a certificate, you can show your award notice; you qualify if you get Child Tax Credits, Working Tax Credits with a disability element (or both) and have income for tax credit purposes of £15,276 or less you are named on a valid HC2 certificate Find out more about the NHS Low Income Scheme (LIS).   Partial help If your name is on a valid HC3 certificate, you may not have to pay for all your treatment. Checks are made on free and reduced cost treatment claims. If you say you have the right to free treatment when you do not, you may incur a penalty charge.  Note You will not be exempt from paying because you receive: Incapacity Benefit, contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance, contribution-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance, Disability Living Allowance, Council Tax Benefit, Housing Benefit or Pension Credit savings credit, when paid on their own. Medical conditions do not exempt patients from payment for dental treatment. You will be asked to show your dentist written proof that you do not have to pay for all or part of your NHS treatment. You will also be asked to sign a form to confirm that you do not have to pay. I am on a low income, how can I get help with NHS charges? If you are on a low income you may be eligible to receive financial help through the NHS Low Income Scheme. To apply for an HC2 certificate, you should complete form HC1, which is available from Jobcentre Plus offices or most NHS hospitals. Your doctor, dentist or optician may be able to give you one, too. You can also get an HC1 form by calling 0845 610 1112. Whether you qualify for help is based on a comparison between your weekly income and assessed requirements at the time the claim is made. For more information about requirements visit NHS: help with health costs. You will qualify for a full-help HC2 certificate (which includes free NHS prescriptions) if your income is less than or equal to your requirements, or your income is greater than your requirements by no more than half the current English prescription charge. You will qualify for a limited-help HC3 certificate if your income is greater than your requirements by more than half the current English prescription charge. The HC3 certificate shows how much you have to pay towards your health costs. Certificates are usually valid for periods of between six months and five years, depending on your circumstances. Find out more about the NHS Low Income Scheme (LIS). Exemption for pregnant women Pregnant women and those who have had a baby in the last 12 months get free NHS dental treatment. You may have to show proof such as a maternity exemption certificate (MatEx), a maternity certificate (MATB1) or your baby's birth certificate. However, if you have given birth more than 12 months ago you will not be entitled to free NHS dental treatment. Please note that your MatEx alone only gives exemption from NHS prescriptions. How do I claim for help with NHS dental charges? Tell your dental practice you want NHS treatment when you make an appointment, and fill out the form you are given when you arrive. If you do not have to pay, put a cross in the appropriate box. If you have a valid HC2 certificate or tax credit exemption certificate, write in the certificate number. If you have a valid HC3 certificate, write in the certificate number and the maximum your certificate says you can pay. You will pay either what appears on the certificate or the actual charge, whichever is the least. You will be asked to show proof of your entitlement to help with dental costs. If you are not sure you are entitled to help, then you must pay. You can claim a refund, but make sure you keep all receipts. How can I claim a refund? Ask your dentist for the NHS receipt form FP64 or a receipt that shows the amount of the NHS charge and the date you paid. If you are claiming on the grounds of low income, complete form HC5 (D): Refund of NHS dental charges  (PDF, 60kb). It tells you where to send the completed form. If you want to claim a refund for another reason, for example, because you are pregnant, have had a baby in the previous 12 months, are aged under 18 or 18 and in full-time education, you will need to explain why you are claiming a refund. Enclose your receipt and make sure you include your full name and the address of your dentist, and write to: NHS Business Services Authority NHS Dental Services PO Box 3181 St Annes Road Eastbourne BN21 9PQ Note: refunds of charges for private dental treatment or sundry items such as toothbrushes cannot be made. Where a course of treatment is a mixture of NHS and private treatment a refund of the NHS charge only can be made.

Orthodontic treatment can straighten the teeth and move them into a better position.   Healthcare professionals specialising in orthodontics are known as orthodontists. You can find a list of all specialist orthodontists registered in the UK on the General Dental Council (GDC) website. What does orthodontic treatment involve? Orthodontics uses devices such as a brace to correct the position of the teeth. Your exact treatment will depend on the problems with your teeth. In some cases, you may have to wear headgear at night as well as a brace, and you may also need to have some teeth removed as part of your treatment. The length of treatment will depend on how complicated the problem is, but it's usually between 18 and 24 months.  Read more about the types of orthodontic treatment. Who needs orthodontic treatment? Many people have crowded or crooked teeth, or their teeth don't meet correctly when they bite. These problems can mean the teeth are more likely to become damaged or put a strain on jaw muscles.   In some cases, abnormal development of the teeth and jaw can affect the shape of the face. Problems with crooked and out-of-place teeth are quite common in the UK. It's thought around a third of 12-year-olds would benefit from some degree of orthodontic treatment. Read more about when orthodontic treatment is used. How can I access orthodontic treatment? In most cases, you or your child will be referred to an orthodontist by your dentist, although you may be able to seek treatment directly. If orthodontic treatment is recommended, you may have to decide whether to have treatment privately or on the NHS. NHS orthodontic treatment is free for people under the age of 18 with a clear clinical need for treatment. However, because of the high demand for treatment, there can be a long waiting list for NHS orthodontic treatment. If you don't qualify for free NHS treatment, or you don't want to wait for treatment to start, you may choose to have private treatment. Private treatment is widely available but can be expensive, with an average fee of between £2,000 and £6,000. Read more about accessing orthodontic treatment. Keeping your braces clean A common complication of orthodontics is tooth decay. Your mouth is full of bacteria that combine with small food particles and saliva to form a sticky film known as plaque. which leads to plaque and causes the enamel to decay. Many people with appliances find it difficult to keep their teeth clean, so additional brushing is essential during treatment. To reduce your risk of enamel decay, your orthodontist may recommend using toothpaste with high levels of fluoride or a mouthwash that contains fluoride. You should also try to avoid sugary foods and fizzy drinks. Read more about how to maintain good dental health.

The infection is caused by bacteria that live in the mouth and invade the tooth. This can happen after: tooth decay leaky fillings damage to teeth as a result of trauma, such as a fall This topic covers: Tooth structure When it's needed How it's performed Recovery Tooth structure  A tooth is made up of two parts. The crown is the top part of the tooth that's visible in the mouth. The root extends into the bone of the jaw, anchoring the tooth in position. Teeth also consist of: enamel \u2013 the hard outer coating dentine \u2013 a softer material that supports the enamel and forms most of the tooth  cementum \u2013 a hard material that coats the root's surface dental pulp \u2013 the soft tissue at the centre of the tooth The root canal system contains the dental pulp and extends from the crown of the tooth to the end of the root. A single tooth can have more than one root canal. When root canal treatment is needed Root canal treatment is only required when dental X-rays show that the pulp has been damaged by a bacterial infection. The pulp will begin to die if it's infected by bacteria, allowing the bacteria to then multiply and spread. The symptoms of a pulp infection include: pain when eating or drinking hot or cold food and drink pain when biting or chewing a loose tooth As the infection progresses, these symptoms often disappear as the pulp dies. Your tooth then appears to have healed, but the infection has in fact spread through the root canal system. Further symptoms eventually occur, such as: pain when biting or chewing returning swelling of the gum near the affected tooth pus oozing from the affected tooth facial swelling the tooth becoming a darker colour It's important to see your dentist if you develop toothache. If your tooth is infected, the pulp can't heal by itself. Leaving the infected tooth in your mouth may make it worse. There may also be less chance of the root canal treatment working if the infection within your tooth becomes established. Antibiotics \u2013 medication to treat bacterial infections \u2013 aren't effective in treating root canal infections. How root canal treatment is performed To treat the infection in the root canal, the bacteria need to be removed. This can be done by either: removing the bacteria from the root canal system (root canal treatment) removing the tooth (extraction) However, removing the tooth isn't usually recommended as it's better to keep as many of your natural teeth as possible. After the bacteria have been removed, the root canal will be filled and the tooth sealed with a filling or crown. In most cases the inflamed tissue near the tooth will heal naturally. Before having root canal treatment, you'll usually be given a local anaesthetic. This means the procedure shouldn't be painful and should be no more unpleasant than having a filling. Root canal treatment is usually successful. In about 9 out of 10 cases a tooth can survive for up to 10 years after root canal treatment. Read about how root canal treatment is performed. Recovering from root canal treatment It's important to look after your teeth when recovering from root canal treatment. You should avoid biting on hard foods until all of your treatment is complete. After your final treatment, your restored tooth shouldn't be painful, although it may feel sensitive for a few days. Over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, can be used to relieve any discomfort. Return to your dentist if you continue to experience pain or swelling after using painkillers. In most cases it's possible to prevent the need for further root canal treatment by: maintaining good oral hygiene  not consuming too much sugary food giving up smoking if you smoke Read more about dental health.

But does teeth whitening work and is it safe? Here are the answers to common questions about the treatment. What is teeth whitening? Teeth whitening involves bleaching your teeth to make them lighter. Teeth whitening can't make your teeth brilliant white, but it can lighten the existing colour by several shades. Who can perform teeth whitening? Teeth whitening is a form of dentistry and should only be performed by a dentist or another regulated dental professional, such as a dental hygienist or dental therapist, on the prescription of a dentist. Some beauty salons offer teeth whitening, but this is illegal if there's no dental professional present, and it may put your oral health at risk. You can also buy DIY home teeth whitening kits but these may also carry risks. What happens during teeth whitening at the dentist? If you have teeth whitening you will need to make several visits to the dental surgery over a couple of months. The dentist will take an impression of your teeth to make a mouthguard and will instruct you how to use it with a bleaching gel. Then, using your mouthguard at home, you regularly apply the gel for a specified period of time over two to four weeks. Some whitening gels can be left on for up to eight hours at a time, which shortens the treatment period to one week. Another type of teeth whitening system that a dentist can provide is called laser whitening, which is also known as power whitening. This is where a bleaching product is painted onto your teeth and then a light or laser is shone on them to activate the whitening. Laser whitening takes about an hour. Can any dentist whiten teeth? Yes, provided they are registered with the General Dental Council. Registered dental therapists and dental hygienists can also carry out teeth whitening on the prescription of a dentist. To find out if a dental professional is registered with the GDC you can check online or call 0207 167 6000. What about home kits and beauty salons for teeth whitening? Only go to a registered dental professional for teeth whitening because whitening by people who aren't qualified, for example in beauty salons, is illegal. Home kits also carry risks. What are the risks of home kits and salon teeth whitening? Some home kits don't contain enough of the whitening product to be effective. More generally, if a dental professional is not doing the whitening, the mouthguard provided may not fit properly so some of the bleaching gel may leak out onto your gums and into your mouth, causing blistering and sensitivity. Where teeth whitening is carried out in beauty salons by staff without any training or dental qualifications it not only carries a risk to your oral health, but is also illegal. Can you have your teeth whitened on the NHS? You can only have your teeth whitened on the NHS if there's a medical reason for it. For example, this might be to lighten teeth that have discoloured because the nerve has died. Otherwise, teeth whitening by a dentist or other dental professional can only be done privately because it's considered to be a cosmetic treatment. Costs vary and, as a general rule, laser whitening is more expensive than professional bleaching. Find out which dental treatments are available on the NHS. How do you go about getting teeth whitening? Your dentist will advise you whether whitening is right for you. It may be that teeth whitening isn't suitable, for example if you have gum disease or crowns. Find your nearest dentist here. What questions should I ask the dentist before going ahead? Don't be afraid to ask simple questions about the types of whitening treatment available, what results you can expect and whether the work is guaranteed for a certain amount of time. Also, ask them what they consider to be the risks in your particular case, for example increasing sensitivity of the teeth. Try to talk to other people who have had the same treatment or visit another dentist for a second opinion until you feel confident. Always ask for a written treatment plan and price estimate before going ahead. Is teeth whitening permanent? No, teeth whitening isn't permanent. It can last from a few months to up to three years, but this varies from person to person. Generally, the whitening effect won't last as long if you smoke or drink red wine, tea or coffee, which can all stain your teeth. Will teeth whitening work on false teeth? No. Teeth whitening won't work on dentures, crowns, fillings or veneers. What are the risks of teeth whitening? No matter what treatment you use, there is a chance your gums can be sensitive to the chemicals used in teeth whitening, especially if you already have sensitive teeth. There's also a chance of burns to gums and some of the whitening kits used at home can harm tooth enamel. What if I'm not happy with the results? If you're concerned that teeth whitening by a dental professional has harmed you, contact the Dental Complaints Service on 0208 253 0800. This is an expert, free and independent service that can help if you have a complaint about private dental care. If you think your teeth whitening has been carried out illegally (that is, by someone not qualified or registered to perform it) contact the General Dental Council on 0207 167 6000 or email illegalpractice@gdc-uk.org.  Read more about how to look after your teeth.

If plaque is allowed to build up, it can lead to further problems, such as dental caries (holes in the teeth), gum disease or dental abscesses, which are collections of pus at the end of the teeth or in the gums. This topic covers: Symptoms  Seeing a dentist  Treatment Cost of NHS treatment Prevention Protecting your child's teeth How plaque causes tooth decay Symptoms of tooth decay Tooth decay may not cause any pain. However, if you have dental caries you might have:  toothache \u2013 either continuous pain keeping you awake or occasional sharp pain without an obvious cause tooth sensitivity \u2013 you may feel tenderness or pain when eating or drinking something hot, cold or sweet grey, brown or black spots appearing on your teeth bad breath an unpleasant taste in your mouth Seeing a dentist Visit your dentist regularly, so early tooth decay can be treated as soon as possible and the prevention of decay can begin. Tooth decay is much easier and cheaper to treat in its early stages. Dentists can usually identify tooth decay and further problems with a simple examination or X-ray. Find your nearest dentist. It's also important to have regular dental check-ups. Adults should have a check-up at least once every two years and children under the age of 18 should have a check-up at least once a year. Read more on: how to find an NHS dentist what to expect when you visit your dentist getting over a fear of the dentist Treatments for tooth decay Treatment of tooth decay depends on how advanced it is. For early stage tooth decay \u2013 your dentist will talk to you about the amount of sugar in your diet and the times you eat. They may apply a fluoride gel, varnish or paste to the area. Fluoride helps to protect teeth by strengthening the enamel, making teeth more resistant to the acids from plaque that can cause tooth decay. Your dentist may discuss a filling or crown with you \u2013 this involves removing the dental decay, offering local anaesthetic to numb the tooth and filling the hole. Read about what NHS fillings and crowns are made of. If tooth decay has spread to the pulp (in the centre of the tooth, containing blood and nerves) \u2013 this may be removed in a process known as root canal treatment. If the tooth is so badly damaged that it can't be restored \u2013 it may need to be removed. Your dentist may be able to replace the tooth with a partial denture, bridge or implant. Cost of NHS treatment NHS charges are set by the government and are standard for all NHS patients. Charges are assessed each year and usually change every April. Some people don't have to pay for dental treatment, including children, pregnant women and new mothers. Financial help may also be available to those on a low income. Read more about: NHS dental charges Getting help with dental charges The cost of private dental treatment varies between practices, as there is no set charge. If you choose to see a private dentist, make sure to agree the cost before having treatment. Preventing tooth decay Although tooth decay is a common problem, it's often entirely preventable. The best way to avoid tooth decay is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. For example, you should: visit your dentist regularly \u2013 your dentist will decide how often they need to see you based on the condition of your mouth, teeth and gums cut down on sugary and starchy food and drinks, particularly between meals or within an hour of going to bed \u2013 some medications can also contain sugar, so it's best to look for sugar-free alternatives where possible look after your teeth and gums \u2013 brushing your teeth properly with a fluoride toothpaste twice a day, using floss and an interdental brush at least once a day avoid smoking or drinking alcohol excessively \u2013 tobacco can interfere with saliva production, which helps to keep your teeth clean, and alcohol can contribute to the erosion of tooth enamel see your dentist or GP if you have a persistently dry mouth \u2013 this may be caused by certain medicines, treatment or medical conditions Read: how to keep your teeth clean lifestyle tips for healthy teeth how does sugar in our diet affect our health? reading food labels  Protecting your child's teeth Establishing good eating habits by limiting sugary snacks and drinks can help your child avoid tooth decay. Regular visits to the dentist at an early age should also be encouraged. It's important to teach your child how to clean their teeth properly and regularly. Your dentist can show you how to do this. Younger children should use a children's toothpaste, but make sure to read the label about how to use it.  Children should still brush their teeth twice a day, especially before bedtime. Read more about: how to look after your baby's teeth how to look after your children's teeth tips on giving your child sweets, fizzy drinks and using bottles How plaque causes tooth decay Your mouth is full of bacteria that form a film over the teeth called dental plaque. When you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates \u2013 particularly sugary foods and drinks \u2013 the bacteria in plaque turn the carbohydrates into energy they need, producing acid at the same time. If the plaque is allowed to build up, the acid can begin to break down (dissolve) the surface of your tooth, causing holes known as cavities. Once cavities have formed in the enamel, the plaque and bacteria can reach the dentine (the softer, bone-like material underneath the enamel). As the dentine is softer than the enamel, the process of tooth decay speeds up. Without treatment, bacteria will enter the pulp (the soft centre of the tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels). At this stage, your nerves will be exposed to bacteria, usually making your tooth painful. The bacteria can cause a dental abscess in the pulp and the infection could spread into the bone, causing another type of abscess.

You may feel toothache in many ways. It can come and go or be constant. Eating or drinking can make the pain worse, particularly if the food or drink is hot or cold. The pain can also be mild or severe. It may feel \"sharp\" and start suddenly. It can be worse at night, particularly when you're lying down. A lost filling or broken tooth can sometimes start the pain. It can also sometimes be difficult to decide whether the pain is in your upper or lower teeth. When a lower molar tooth is affected, the pain can often feel like it's coming from the ear. Toothache in other upper teeth may feel like it's coming from the sinuses, the small, air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead. The area of your jaw close to the infected tooth may also be sore and tender to touch. It's also possible for periodontal disease to give rise to a \"dull\" pain. Periodontal disease is a bacterial infection that affects the soft and hard structures that support the teeth. When to see your dentist If you have toothache for more than one or two days, visit your dentist as soon as possible to have it treated. The longer you leave it, the worse it will get. If your toothache isn't treated, the pulp inside your tooth will eventually become infected. This can usually lead to a dental abscess, with severe and continuous throbbing pain. Painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, may reduce the pain and discomfort while you're waiting for an appointment. Children under 16 years of age shouldn't be given aspirin. Find a dentist near you. What causes toothache? Toothache occurs when the innermost layer of the tooth (dental pulp) becomes inflamed. The pulp is made up of sensitive nerves and blood vessels. Dental pulp can become inflamed as a result of: tooth decay \u2013 this leads to holes (cavities) forming in the hard surface of the tooth a cracked tooth \u2013 the crack is often so small that it can't be seen with the naked eye loose or broken fillings receding gums \u2013 where the gums shrink (contract) to expose softer, more sensitive parts of the tooth root periapical abscess \u2013 a collection of pus at the end of the tooth caused by a bacterial infection There are a number of other conditions that can cause pain similar to toothache, even though the pulp isn't affected. These include: periodontal abscess \u2013 a collection of pus in the gums caused by a bacterial infection ulcers on your gums sore or swollen gums around a tooth that's breaking through \u2013 for example, when your wisdom teeth start to come through  sinusitis \u2013 which sometimes causes pain around the upper jaw an injury to the joint that attaches the jaw to the skull (temporomandibular joint) Babies can also experience discomfort when their teeth start to develop. This is known as teething. Treating toothache The type of treatment you have for toothache will depend on the cause of the pain, so your dentist will examine your mouth and may carry out an X-ray to try to identify the problem. If your toothache is caused by tooth decay, your dentist will remove the decayed area and replace it with a filling. If your toothache is caused by a loose or broken filling, the filling will be taken out, any decay will be removed, and a new filling put in place. If the pulp inside your tooth is infected, you may need root canal treatment. This procedure involves removing the infected pulp and then inserting a special type of filling to seal the tooth and prevent reinfection. Your tooth may need to be removed if the toothache can't be treated using these methods or the tooth is wedged between another tooth and your jaw (impacted). Preventing toothache The best way to avoid getting toothache and other dental problems is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. To do this, you should: limit your intake of sugary foods and drinks \u2013 you should have these as an occasional treat and only at mealtimes; read more about cutting down on sugar brush your teeth twice a day using a toothpaste that contains fluoride \u2013 gently brush your gums and tongue as well clean between your teeth using dental floss and, if necessary, use a mouthwash  don't smoke \u2013 it can make some dental problems worse Make sure you have regular dental check-ups, preferably with the same dentist.  The time between check-ups can vary, depending on how healthy your teeth and gums are and your risk of developing future problems. Your dentist will suggest when you should have your next check-up based on your overall oral health. Children should have a dental check-up every six months so tooth decay can be spotted and treated early. Read more about taking care of your teeth and keeping your teeth clean.

This is the first part of each course of NHS treatment and is included in the Band 1 (£19.70) charge. You do not have to register with a dentist in the same way as with a GP to receive NHS treatment. Therefore, you should not be asked to have an examination or pay for any private work before being accepted by an NHS dentist. If you haven\u2019t seen a dentist for several years because of fear or anxiety, read our tips to ease fear of the dentist. Read about your dental team for an overview of the different professionals you may see at your dental practice. At your check-up, your dentist will assess your current oral health, any risk of future disease, and advise you on the care and treatment required to secure good oral health. It is important that you try to keep your teeth healthy and clean to maintain good oral health. At your check-up, your dentist may: carry out a full examination of your mouth, teeth and gums ask about your general health and any problems you have had with your teeth, mouth or gums since your last visit ask about and give advice on your diet, smoking and drinking ask about your teeth-cleaning habits and give you advice on the most appropriate ways to keep your mouth, teeth and gums healthy explain any risks, as well as costs, of all treatment you may need discuss with you when your next visit should be You don't necessarily need to see your dentist every six months. Your dentist will recommend how often you should come to see them, based on your current dental health. If you have problems with your teeth between check-ups, contact your dental practice to make an earlier appointment. Find out about emergency dental care. The dental treatment plan If your dentist recommends a Band 2 or Band 3 dental treatment, you'll be given a personal dental treatment plan (PDF, 19kb) in advance. This outlines all the treatments you are having on the NHS and how much they will cost. If you are not given a treatment plan, ask for one. Treatment plans are usually not given for Band 1 dental treatments, but you can ask for one if you like. If your dentist says you need a particular type of treatment, you should not be asked to pay for it privately. Where alternative private options have been discussed, then those options should be listed on your treatment plan. Separate details of private treatment and charges \u2013 usually on the same form as your NHS treatment plan \u2013 should always be provided in writing before you commit to it. If this isn't done, query this immediately with the practice or make an official complaint. You'll be asked to sign the plan and you'll be given a copy to keep. If you're unhappy about agreeing to your treatment plan or signing it, you have the right to say no to all or any of the recommended treatments. You also have the right to seek a second opinion from another dentist. However, you will have to pay another Band 1 fee for this new consultation. If you decide not to proceed with a certain treatment option then inform your dentist. Likewise the dentist should inform you of any necessary changes to the treatment plan. A dentist may suggest a different treatment sometimes on further investigation or due to changes in your oral health following the initial assessment. Any changes to treatment should be discussed and agreed with you. If your dentist tries to change that course of treatment without your agreement, query this immediately with the practice or make an official complaint.   Missed appointments If you know you will not be able to attend an appointment then please give as much notice as possible to the dental practice so they can cancel your appointment and offer your slot to another patient. Your dentist can terminate your treatment if you miss your appointment without letting the dental practice know. You may then need to pay again for a new course of treatment. While surgeries can\u2019t charge you for not turning up, NHS England has the right to ask you to find another dental practice if you continue to miss appointments. Information you should find at your dental practice When you visit your dental practice, the following should be clearly displayed: a poster about current NHS charges the surgery's complaints procedure a written statement about how the surgery meets the requirements for infection control, health and safety, X-rays and continuing professional development of dentists In addition, you should be given a leaflet about the surgery and its services. If you cannot find any of the information, you have the right to ask for it. What your dentist should not do Your dentist should not: offer NHS treatment to children on condition that a parent or guardian becomes a private patient suggest that NHS treatment is sub-standard make you pay privately for an examination to assess whether you will be accepted for NHS treatment charge you for missed appointments for NHS treatment While surgeries can\u2019t charge you for not turning up, NHS England, has the right to ask you to find another dental practice if you continue to miss appointments.  Share: Save: Print: Page last reviewed: 26\/01\/2015 Next review due: 26\/01\/2017 Form FP17 Everyone visiting an NHS dentist is required to sign the patient declaration on the FP17 form.

The wisdom teeth grow at the back of your gums and are the last teeth to come through. Most people have four wisdom teeth \u2013 one in each corner. Wisdom teeth usually grow through the gums during the late teens or early twenties. By this time, the other 28 adult teeth are usually in place, so there isn't always enough room in the mouth for the wisdom teeth to grow properly. Because of the lack of space, the wisdom teeth can sometimes emerge at an angle or get stuck and only partially emerge. Wisdom teeth that grow through like this are known as impacted. When to see a dentist You should make an appointment to see your dentist if you're experiencing severe pain or discomfort from your wisdom teeth. Your dentist will check your teeth and advise you on whether they need to be removed. If your dentist thinks you may need your wisdom teeth removed, they'll usually carry out an X-ray of your mouth. This gives them a clearer view of the position of your teeth. As with any teeth problems, it's important to see your dentist as soon as possible, rather than waiting for your regular dental check-up. Why are wisdom teeth removed? Your wisdom teeth don't usually need to be removed if they're impacted but aren't causing any problems. This is because there's no proven benefit of doing this and it carries the risk of complications. Sometimes, wisdom teeth that have become impacted or haven't fully broken through the surface of the gum can cause dental problems. Food and bacteria can get trapped around the edge of the wisdom teeth, causing a build-up of plaque, which can lead to: tooth decay (dental caries) \u2013 this develops when plaque begins to break down the surface of your tooth. When tooth decay becomes more advanced, it leaves holes (cavities) in the tooth, which can affect the surrounding teeth.   gum disease (also called gingivitis or periodontal disease) \u2013 this occurs when plaque releases toxins that irritate your gums, making them red, swollen and painful. Gum disease can also affect the surrounding teeth and the bone around the wisdom teeth. pericoronitis \u2013 when plaque causes an infection of the soft tissue that surrounds the tooth. cellulitis \u2013 a bacterial infection in the cheek, tongue or throat. abscess \u2013 when pus collects in your wisdom teeth or the surrounding tissue due to a bacterial infection. cysts and benign growths \u2013 very rarely, a wisdom tooth that hasn't cut through the gum develops a cyst (a fluid-filled swelling). Many of these problems can be treated with treatment such as antibiotics and antiseptic mouthwash, so removing your wisdom teeth is only recommended when other treatment hasn't worked. How wisdom teeth are removed Your dentist may remove your wisdom teeth or they may refer you to a specialist surgeon for hospital treatment. Before the procedure, you'll usually be given a local anaesthetic injection to numb the area around the tooth. You'll feel some pressure just before the tooth is removed, as your dentist or oral surgeon needs to widen the tooth socket by rocking the tooth back and forth. In some cases a cut may be needed in your gum, and the tooth may need to be cut into smaller pieces before it's removed. The time it takes to remove the tooth will vary. Some procedures only take a few minutes, whereas others can take 20 minutes or longer.  After your wisdom teeth have been removed, you may experience swelling and discomfort, both on the inside and outside of your mouth. This is usually worse for the first three days, but it can last for up to two weeks. Read more about how a wisdom tooth is removed and recovering from wisdom tooth removal. Possible complications As with all surgery, there are risks associated with removing a wisdom tooth. These include infection or delayed healing, both of which are more likely if you smoke during your recovery. Another possible complication is \"dry socket\", which is a dull, aching sensation in your gum or jaw, and sometimes a bad smell or taste coming from the empty tooth socket. Dry socket is more likely if you don't follow the after-care instructions given by your dentist. There's also a small risk of nerve damage, which can cause pain or a tingling sensation and numbness in the tongue, lower lip, chin, teeth and gums. This is usually temporary, but can be permanent in some cases. Read more about the possible complications of wisdom tooth removal. Dental costs Dentists charge depending on the treatment required, unless you're under 18 or otherwise exempt from NHS charges. If hospital treatment is required, it will be provided through the NHS free of charge. Read more about dental costs and find your local dental surgery.

They fit snugly over the gums to replace missing teeth and eliminate potential problems caused by gaps.  Gaps left by missing teeth can cause problems with eating and speech, and teeth either side of the gap may grow into the space at an angle. Sometimes, all the teeth need to be removed and replaced. You may therefore need either: complete dentures (a full set) \u2013 which replace all your upper or lower teeth, or partial dentures \u2013 which replace just one tooth or a few missing teeth Dentures can help to prevent problems with eating and speech and, if you need complete dentures, they can also improve the appearance of your smile and give you confidence. This page provides information for anyone who's considering dentures and advice for those who already wear them. It explains: how dentures are fitted  how to look after your dentures  when to see your dentist  How dentures are fitted Complete dentures A full denture will be fitted if all your upper or lower teeth need to be removed or you're having an old complete denture replaced. The denture will usually be fitted as soon as your teeth are removed, which means you won't be without teeth. The denture will fit snugly over your gums and jawbone. However, if you have dentures fitted immediately after the removal of several teeth, the gums and bone will alter in shape fairly quickly and the dentures will probably need relining or remaking after a few months. Occasionally, your gums may need to be left to heal and alter in shape for several months before dentures can be fitted. You can either see a dentist or a qualified clinical dental technician to have your dentures made and fitted. The difference between a dentist and a clinical dental technician (in terms of producing dentures) is outlined below. A dentist \u2013 will take measurements and impressions (moulds) of your mouth, and then order your full or partial dentures from a dental technician.  A clinical dental technician \u2013 will provide a full set of dentures directly without you having to see your dentist (although you should still have regular dental check-ups with your dentist).  A trial denture will be created from the impressions taken of your mouth. The dentist or clinical dental technician will try this in your mouth to assess the fit and for you to assess the appearance. The shape and colour may be adjusted before the final denture is produced. Partial dentures A partial denture is designed to fill in the gaps left by one or more missing teeth. It's a plastic, nylon or metal plate with a number of false teeth attached to it. It usually clips onto some of your natural teeth via metal clasps, which hold it securely in place in your mouth. It can easily be unclipped and removed. Occasionally, the clips can be made of a tooth- or gum-coloured material, although this type of clip isn't always suitable, because it tends to be more brittle than metal. Your dentist can measure your mouth and order a partial denture for you, or you can see a qualified clinical dental technician, who can provide a partial denture for you directly after you've first seen your dentist for a treatment plan and certificate of oral health. The British Dental Health Foundation website has more information and advice about bridges and partial dentures, including which type of denture (metal or plastic) is best for you. A fixed bridge is an alternative to a partial denture and may be suitable for some people. Crowns are put on the teeth either side of the gap and joined together by a false tooth that's put in the gap.  Looking after your dentures Dentures may feel a bit strange to begin with, but you'll soon get used to wearing them. At first, you may need to wear your dentures all the time, including while sleeping. Your dentist or clinical dental technician will advise you on whether you should remove your dentures before you go to sleep.  It isn't always necessary to remove your dentures at night, but doing so can allow your gums to rest as you sleep. If you remove your dentures, they should be kept moist \u2013 for example, in water or a polythene bag with some dampened cotton wool in it, or in a suitable overnight denture-cleaning solution. This will stop the denture material from drying out and changing shape. Dental hygiene Keeping your mouth clean is just as important when you wear dentures. You should brush your remaining teeth, gums and tongue every morning and evening with fluoride toothpaste to prevent tooth decay, gum disease and other dental problems. Read more about how to keep your teeth clean. Cleaning dentures It's important to regularly remove plaque and food deposits from your dentures, because unclean dentures can also lead to problems, such as bad breath, gum disease, tooth decay and oral thrush. Clean your dentures as often as you would normal teeth (at least twice a day \u2013 every morning and night). You should: brush your dentures with toothpaste or soap and water before soaking them to remove food particles soak them in a fizzy solution of denture-cleaning tablets to remove stains and bacteria (follow the manufacturer's instructions) brush them again, as you would your normal teeth (but don't scrub them too hard) Dentures may break if you drop them, so you should clean them over a bowl or sink filled with water, or something soft such as a folded towel. The British Dental Health Foundation website has more information on denture cleaning. Eating with dentures When you first start wearing dentures, you should eat soft foods cut into small pieces and chew slowly, using both sides of your mouth. Avoid chewing gum and any food that's sticky, hard or has sharp edges. You can gradually start to eat other types of food until you're back to your old diet. Never use toothpicks. Denture adhesive If your dentures fit properly, you shouldn't necessarily need to use denture fixative (adhesive). However, if your jawbone has shrunk significantly, adhesive may be the only way to help retain your dentures. Your dentist or clinical dental technician will advise you if this is the case. At first, some people feel more confident with their dentures if they use adhesive. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and avoid using excessive amounts. Adhesive can be removed from the denture by brushing with soap and water. Remnants of adhesive left in the mouth may need to be removed with some damp kitchen roll or a clean damp flannel. When to see your dentist You should continue to see your dentist regularly if you have dentures (even if you have complete dentures) so they can check for any problems. Your dentures should last several years if you take good care of them. However, your gums and jawbone will eventually shrink, which means the dentures may not fit as well as they used to and can become loose, or they may become worn. See your dentist as soon as possible if: your dentures click when you're talking your dentures tend to slip, or you feel they no longer fit properly your dentures feel uncomfortable your dentures are visibly worn you have signs of gum disease or tooth decay, such as bleeding gums or bad breath If poorly fitting or worn dentures aren't replaced, they can cause great discomfort and lead to mouth sores, infections or problems eating and speaking.

We all go through spells of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people still think that depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong. Depression is a real illness with real symptoms, and it's not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people can make a full recovery. How to tell if you have depression Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of sadness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety. There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and complaining of various aches and pains. The severity of the symptoms can vary. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit (read about low mood), while at its most severe depression can make you feel suicidal and that life is no longer worth living. For a more detailed list, read more about the symptoms of depression.  Most people experience feelings of stress, sadness or anxiety during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short time, rather than being a sign of depression. Read more information about low mood and depression. If you've been feeling low for more than a few days, take this short test to find out if you're depressed. When to see a doctor It's important to seek help from your GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery.

Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or even having a baby, can bring it on.  People with a family history of depression are also more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Find out more about the causes of depression. Depression is quite common and affects about one in 10 of us at some point. It affects men and women, young and old. Depression can also strike children. Studies have shown that about 4% of children aged five to 16 in the UK are anxious or depressed. Treatment Treatment for depression involves either medication or talking treatments, or usually a combination of the two. The kind of treatment that your doctor recommends will be based on the type of depression you have. Read more about the treatment of depression. Living with depression Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes such as getting more exercise, cutting down on alcohol, stopping smoking and eating more healthily.  Self-help measures such as reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. Find out more about how self-help and improving your lifestyle can help you beat depression. Read how stopping smoking can improve your mood.

People with bipolar disorder have periods or episodes of: depression \u2013 feeling very low and lethargic mania \u2013 feeling very high and overactive (less severe mania is known as hypomania) Symptoms of bipolar disorder depend on which mood you're experiencing. Unlike simple mood swings, each extreme episode of bipolar disorder can last for several weeks (or even longer), and some people may not experience a \"normal\" mood very often. Depression You may initially be diagnosed with clinical depression before having a future manic episode (sometimes years later), after which you may be diagnosed with bipolar disorder. During an episode of depression, you may have overwhelming feelings of worthlessness, which can potentially lead to thoughts of suicide. If you're feeling suicidal or having severe depressive symptoms, contact your GP, care co-ordinator or local mental health emergency services as soon as possible. If you want to talk to someone confidentially, call the Samaritans, free of charge, on 116 123. You can talk to them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Alternatively, visit the Samaritans website or email jo@samaritans.org. Mania During a manic phase of bipolar disorder, you may feel very happy and have lots of energy, ambitious plans and ideas. You may spend large amounts of money on things you can't afford and wouldn't normally want. Not feeling like eating or sleeping, talking quickly and becoming annoyed easily are also common characteristics of this phase. You may feel very creative and view the manic phase of bipolar as a positive experience. However, you may also experience symptoms of psychosis, where you see or hear things that aren't there or become convinced of things that aren't true. Living with bipolar disorder The high and low phases of bipolar disorder are often so extreme that they interfere with everyday life. However, there are several options for treating bipolar disorder that can make a difference. They aim to control the effects of an episode and help someone with bipolar disorder live life as normally as possible. The following treatment options are available: medication to prevent episodes of mania, hypomania (less severe mania) and depression \u2013 these are known as mood stabilisers and are taken every day on a long-term basis medication to treat the main symptoms of depression and mania when they occur learning to recognise the triggers and signs of an episode of depression or mania psychological treatment \u2013 such as talking therapy, which can help you deal with depression, and provides advice about how to improve your relationships lifestyle advice \u2013 such as doing regular exercise, planning activities you enjoy that give you a sense of achievement, as well as advice on improving your diet and getting more sleep It's thought using a combination of different treatment methods is the best way to control bipolar disorder. Help and advice for people with a long-term condition or their carers is also available from charities, support groups and associations. This includes self-help and self-management advice, and learning to deal with the practical aspects of a long-term condition. Find out more about living with bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder and pregnancy Bipolar disorder, like all other mental health problems, can get worse during pregnancy. However, specialist help is available if you need it. Read more about bipolar disorder in pregnancy. What causes bipolar disorder? The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, although it's believed a number of things can trigger an episode. Extreme stress, overwhelming problems and life-changing events are thought to contribute, as well as genetic and chemical factors. Who's affected? Bipolar disorder is fairly common and one in every 100 adults will be diagnosed with the condition at some point in their life. Bipolar disorder can occur at any age, although it often develops between the ages of 15 and 19 and rarely develops after 40. Men and women from all backgrounds are equally likely to develop bipolar disorder. The pattern of mood swings in bipolar disorder varies widely between people. For example, some people only have a couple of bipolar episodes in their lifetime and are stable in between, while others have many episodes. Bipolar disorder and driving If you have bipolar disorder, the condition may impair your driving. You must inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about any medical condition that could affect your ability to drive.

It's a common problem, affecting more than 1 in every 10 women within a year of giving birth. It can also affect fathers and partners, although this is less common. It's important to seek help as soon as possible if you think you might be depressed, as your symptoms could last months or get worse and have a significant impact on you, your baby and your family. With the right support, which can include self-help strategies and therapy, most women make a full recovery. Symptoms of postnatal depression Many women feel a bit down, tearful or anxious in the first week after giving birth. This is often called the \"baby blues\" and is so common that it\u2019s considered normal. The \"baby blues\" don\u2019t last for more than two weeks after giving birth.  If your symptoms last longer or start later, you could have postnatal depression. Postnatal depression can start any time in the first year after giving birth. Signs that you or someone you know might be depressed include: a persistent feeling of sadness and low mood lack of enjoyment and loss of interest in the wider world lack of energy and feeling tired all the time trouble sleeping at night and feeling sleepy during the day difficulty bonding with your baby withdrawing from contact with other people problems concentrating and making decisions frightening thoughts \u2013 for example, about hurting your baby Many women don't realise they have postnatal depression, because it can develop gradually. Read more about the symptoms of postnatal depression. Getting help for postnatal depression Speak to your GP or health visitor if you think you may be depressed. Many health visitors have been trained to recognise postnatal depression and have techniques that can help. If they can't help, they'll know someone in your area who can. Encourage your partner to seek help if you think they might be having problems. Don't struggle alone hoping that the problem will go away. Remember that: a range of help and support is available, including therapy depression is an illness like any other  it's not your fault you're depressed \u2013 it can happen to anyone being depressed doesn't mean you're a bad parent it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going mad your baby won't be taken away from you \u2013 babies are only taken into care in very exceptional circumstances Treatments for postnatal depression Postnatal depression can be lonely, distressing and frightening, but support and effective treatments are available. These include: self-help \u2013 things you can try yourself include: talking to your family and friends about your feelings and what they can do to help; making time for yourself to do things you enjoy; resting whenever you get the chance and getting as much sleep as you can at night; exercising regularly; eating a healthy diet psychological therapy \u2013 your GP may be able to recommend a self-help course, or may refer you for a course of therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) antidepressants \u2013 these may be recommended if your depression is more severe or other treatments haven't helped; your doctor can prescribe a medicine that's safe to take while breastfeeding Local and national organisations, such as the Association for Post Natal Illness (APNI) and Pre and Postnatal Depression Advice and Support (PANDAS), can also be useful sources of help and advice. Read more about treating postnatal depression. What causes postnatal depression? The cause of postnatal depression isn't completely clear. Some of the factors it has been associated with include: a history of mental health problems, particularly depression, earlier in life a history of mental health problems during pregnancy having no close family or friends to support you a poor relationship with your partner recent stressful life events, such as a bereavement experiencing the \"baby blues\" Even if you don't have any of these symptoms, having a baby is a life-changing event that can sometimes trigger depression. It often takes time to adapt to becoming a new parent. Looking after a small baby can be stressful and exhausting. Can postnatal depression be prevented? Although there have been several studies into preventing postnatal depression, there is no evidence that there\u2019s anything specific you can do to prevent the condition developing, apart from maintaining as healthy a lifestyle as you can for yourself. However, if you have a history of depression or mental health problems, or if you have a family history of mental health problems after childbirth, tell your GP or mental health team if you\u2019re pregnant or thinking of having a baby. This is so they can offer you appropriate monitoring and treatment, if necessary. If you have had a mental health problem while pregnant, your doctor should arrange for you to be seen regularly in the first few weeks after birth. Myths about postnatal depression Postnatal depression is often misunderstood and there are many myths surrounding it. These include: Postnatal depression is less severe than other types of depression. In fact, it's as serious as other types of depression. Postnatal depression is entirely caused by hormonal changes. It's actually caused by many different factors. Postnatal depression will soon pass. Unlike the \"baby blues\", postnatal depression can persist for months if left untreated. In a minority of cases, it can become a long-term problem. Postnatal depression only affects women. Research has actually found that up to 1 in 25 new fathers become depressed after having a baby.

Depression with psychosis is known as psychotic depression. What are the symptoms of severe depression? Having severe clinical depression means feeling sad and hopeless for most of the day, practically every day, and having no interest in anything. Getting through the day feels almost impossible. Other typical symptoms of severe depression are: fatigue (exhaustion) loss of pleasure in things disturbed sleep changes in appetite feeling worthless and guilty being unable to concentrate or being indecisive thoughts of death or suicide Read more about the psychological, physical and social symptoms of clinical depression. What are the symptoms of psychosis? Having moments of psychosis (psychotic episodes) means experiencing: delusions \u2013 thoughts or beliefs that are unlikely to be true  hallucinations \u2013 when a person hears (and in some cases feels, smells, sees or tastes) things that aren't there; a common hallucination is hearing voices (read more about hallucinations and hearing voices) The delusions and hallucinations almost always reflect the person's deeply depressed mood \u2013 for example, they may become convinced they're to blame for something, or that they've committed a crime. \"Psychomotor agitation\" is also common \u2013 this means not being able to relax or sit still, and constantly fidgeting.  Or, at the other extreme, a person with psychotic depression may have \"psychomotor retardation\", where both their thoughts and physical movements slow down. People with psychotic depression are at greater risk than normal of thinking about suicide. What's the cause? The cause of psychotic depression is not fully understood. What we do know is that there's no single cause of depression and it has many different triggers. For some, stressful life events such as bereavement, divorce, serious illness or financial worries can be the cause. Genes probably play a part, as severe depression can run in families, although it's not known why some people also develop psychosis. Many people with psychotic depression will have experienced adversity in childhood, such as a traumatic event. Learn more about the causes of clinical depression. How is it treated? Treatment for psychotic depression involves: medication \u2013 a combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants can help relieve the symptoms of psychosis psychological therapies \u2013 the one-to-one talking therapy cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has proved successful in helping some people with psychosis social support \u2013 support with social needs, such as education, employment or accommodation The patient may need to stay in hospital for a short period while they're receiving this treatment. Sometimes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be recommended if the patient has severe depression and other treatments, including antidepressants, haven't worked. Read more about ECT. Treatment is usually very effective, although patients may need to be continuously monitored in follow-up appointments. Getting help for others People with psychosis are often unaware that they're thinking and acting strangely. Because of this lack of insight, it's often down to the friends, relatives or carers of a person affected by psychosis to seek help for them. If you're concerned about someone you know and think they may have psychosis, you could contact their social worker or community mental health nurse if they've previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition. If this is the first time they've shown symptoms, contact their GP or take them to A&E. If you think the person\u2019s symptoms are placing them at possible risk of harm you can: take them to the nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if they agree call their GP or local out-of-hours GP call 999 and ask for an ambulance Support and advice More information on psychosis SANE Supporting someone who has experienced psychosis Mind Driving Having psychosis could affect your ability to drive. If you have been diagnosed with psychotic depression, it's your legal obligation to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) as it could affect your driving ability. GOV.UK provides details about telling the DVLA about a medical condition.

They can also be used to increase the volume and definition of the lips and cheeks. The fillers are made from a variety of materials and the effects can be either temporary or permanent, depending on the type of filler: collagen \u2013 effects last three to four months hyaluronic acid \u2013 lasts about four to six months calcium hydroxylapatite \u2013 lasts about 18 months poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) \u2013 effects of injections given over several months may last up to two years polymethylmethacrylate beads (PMMA) \u2013 permanent, but most risky Before you go ahead If you're considering dermal fillers, be certain about why you want to have them.  The procedure can be expensive and has its limitations. Cost: In the UK, facial fillers cost about £150 to £300 per session, depending on the amount of product used. Limitations: Most fillers aren't permanent. There's no guarantee the desired effect will be achieved. The ageing process will still happen elsewhere \u2013 fillers will not, for example, fix a sagging jawline. Safety: Take time to find a reputable practitioner who is properly qualified and practises in a clean, safe and appropriate environment. Ask the practitioner what you should do if something were to go wrong. What it involves You may be offered a local anaesthetic cream or injection. The practitioner injects the filler in a series of small injections and may massage the area. The treatment time can vary from 30 minutes to an hour. It may be uncomfortable, but should not be very painful. Afterwards The area may be a little swollen, tender and red for 24 hours. During that time you may be advised to avoid coffee, alcohol, hot drinks and the sun. Risks The risks of dermal fillers depend on whether the procedure was done correctly and the type of filler used. Permanent fillers have the highest risk of problems and some practitioners feel they are best avoided. General risks of dermal fillers include: rashes, swelling, itching and bruising an infection the filler moving away from the intended treatment area over time (in rare cases) the filler forming lumps under the skin \u2013 this may need to be treated with surgery or medication (in rare cases) the filler blocking a blood vessel \u2013 this can lead to tissue death, permanent blindness or a pulmonary embolism What to do if you have problems If you've had fillers and are not happy with the results or are experiencing problems such as lumpiness, take up the matter with your practitioner through the clinic where you were treated. If there are any complications that require medical attention, it is best that you go back to the practitioner who treated you. If this is not possible, you can go to your GP or local accident and emergency (A&E) department. You can also report any side effects directly through the Yellow Card Scheme website. By reporting side effects, you are helping to provide more information on the safety of this medicine.

It is an impulse-control disorder \u2013 a psychological condition where the person is unable to stop themselves carrying out a particular action. Do I have it? A person with dermatillomania will habitually and excessively pick, scratch, gouge or squeeze at otherwise healthy skin. They usually pick at the skin on their face and lips, but it can be any area of the body, such as the hands, scalp or arms. They may pick at normal skin features such as freckles or moles, or at imaginary skin defects that no-one else can see. They might pick with their fingernails, or use tools such as pins or tweezers. The result is often bleeding or bruising, which carries a risk of infection and scars. Emotions A person with dermatillomania will experience intense emotions as part of their compulsion.  It's typical to experience an intense urge to pick the skin, with increasing tension until they do. After picking, there is a sense of relief. Dermatillomania can cause negative feelings, such as guilt, shame and embarrassment. It's common to try to deny it or cover up the skin with make-up. A person with dermatillomania may feel unattractive and develop low self-esteem, avoiding others. Who develops dermatillomania? Impulse-control disorders in general are more common among teenagers and young adults.  Dermatillomania tends to develop in the teenage years or early 20s, and affects more girls than boys. It might start as a habit, then become uncontrollable. It is regarded as a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Learn about the causes of OCD. Why does dermatillomania happen? It's not known what causes dermatillomania, but there are several theories. Some experts think it is a type of addiction. The more you pick your skin, the more you want to keep doing it. Dermatillomania may be a reflection of a mental health problem. Psychological and behavioural theories suggest that skin picking may be a way of relieving stress or anxiety. In some cases, dermatillomania may be a form of self-harm, where you deliberately injure yourself as a way of seeking temporary relief from emotional distress. Another very similar disorder is trichotillomania \u2013 where a person compulsively pulls their hair out. It's not uncommon for someone to have OCD and to both compulsively pick at their skin and pull their hair out. What should I do? See your GP if you're compulsively picking your skin or if you notice your child doing so. Your GP can refer you to a psychologist or psychiatrist for a form of talking therapy. You may need to be referred to a dermatologist (skin specialist) first, if the skin is badly damaged. Talking therapy for dermatillomania Little medical research has been conducted into treatments for dermatillomania. The most effective treatment is therapy to change your skin-picking behaviour, combined with a network of emotional support. Psychotherapy is a type of talking therapy that can be used to treat emotional problems and mental health conditions. It involves discussing emotional issues with a trained therapist. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that may be recommended. It helps you to manage your problems by changing how you think and act. CBT often involves behavioural therapy, also known as habit-reversal therapy, which aims to change your behaviour \u2013 in this case, reducing your skin picking. First, you learn how to become more consciously aware of situations and events that may trigger your skin picking. Then, you'll learn to use alternative behaviours as a response. You may be asked to keep a record of when, where and under what circumstances you normally pick. The aim is to replace the harmful skin-picking habit with a habit that is harmless. Tips for quitting Occupy your hands with something else until the urge passes, or put on gloves. When tempted to pick, care for your skin instead \u2013 for example, apply moisturiser. Aim to hold off the urge for longer and longer each time if you can't resist it altogether.  Keep skin clean to avoid infection. Stay busy. Get rid of tweezers, pins and any other instrument you might be tempted to use. Try squeezing a soft ball or playing with blue tack instead. Support If you have dermatillomania, it's important that you receive emotional help and support. This can be from family, friends or self-help groups. Organisations such as OCD UK are good places to start if you're looking for support. See the \"Useful links\" on this page for more contacts.

Contact your GP or NHS 111 immediately, or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if you also have pain in or around your eye or any loss of vision. The information below should give you an idea of what might be wrong, although it shouldn't be used to self-diagnose your condition. It covers possible causes for the following eyelid problems, plus specific advice about what to do. You can find out about: swollen eyelids or eyelid cysts   itchy, flaky or sticky eyelids  lumps on or around the eyelids  hooded or droopy upper eyelids  rolling outwards of the lower eyelids (ectropion)  rolling inwards of the eyelids (entropion)  yellow plaques on the eyelids  excessive blinking or uncontrollable closure of the eyelids  Swollen eyelid or eyelid cyst It's quite common for the upper or lower eyelid to become swollen because of a meibomian cyst (also called a chalazion). This occurs when the glands in the eyelid become blocked. These cysts vary in size, from barely visible to the size of a grape. They usually take weeks to develop. They're not usually painful, but can become red and painful if infected. The cysts can come and go by themselves, although they may take a few months to get better. You can help them heal by holding a clean flannel warmed in hot water to the closed eye for five minutes, and repeating this three to four times a day for up to four weeks. Speak to your GP if you have a cyst that doesn't clear up after a month. They can refer you to have it drained through a small incision (cut). This is a simple procedure carried out under local anaesthetic (your eye area will be numbed). It takes just a few minutes and rarely leaves a scar. Also see your GP if the cyst becomes infected because you may need to take antibiotics to prevent a deep lid infection (cellulitis). Another common cause of a swelling on the eyelid is a stye. A stye is a minor infection of the base of an eyelash that usually clears up on its own in a week or two. Holding a warm flannel to it regularly may help it heal faster. Read more about treating styes. Other causes of lid swelling include an allergic reaction and shingles on the face and eye (usually with a rash), but these are less common. Itchy, flaky or sticky eyelids Itchy and flaky eyelids are usually caused by an inflamed eyelid edge (blepharitis) or dry eye. Your eyelids may also stick together and be difficult to open, particularly when you wake up. These conditions can be irritating, but are rarely serious. You can reduce the irritation by keeping the eyelids clean and using artificial tears if your eyes are dry. Read about treating blepharitis and treating dry eyes. Contact dermatitis is another possible cause of itchy or flaky eyelids. This is a type of eczema triggered when the skin comes into contact with something you are irritated by or allergic to, such as make-up. The condition usually clears up after you stop using the substance your skin is reacting to. Sticky eyelids along with red and watering eyes can be caused by conjunctivitis, which is when an infection, allergy or irritant causes the front of the eye to become inflamed. This can get better on its own, although your GP may be able to prescribe medication to treat the underlying cause. Read more about treating conjunctivitis. Lumps on or around the eyelids Just like anywhere else on the skin, lumps can occur on or around the eyelids. Many lumps are simple cysts or styes (see above). However, occasionally a lump can be a sign of a more serious condition such as skin cancer and may need to be removed. See your GP if you're worried about a lump on or around your eyelids. Most skin cancers are basal cell carcinomas, which very rarely spread to other parts of the body. These often appear as a red or pink lump containing small blood vessels, although they can be pearly-white or \"waxy\" looking. Sometimes they may bleed. Less commonly, the lump may be a squamous cell carcinoma, which is more serious as there\u2019s a small risk it could spread to other parts of the body. These usually look like an ulcer with a red base and a scaly and crusted surface. You may also lose eyelashes where the lump is growing. In rare cases, the lump could be a sign of a very serious type of skin cancer called melanoma that can spread to other parts of the body and can be very dangerous. A lump is more likely to be melanoma if it's an irregular shape, dark or changing in colour, and getting a lot bigger over time. Hooded or droopy upper eyelids As you get older, it's quite common to have excess skin above the upper eyelids that can overhang and block your vision. This is called dermatochalasis. If it affects your vision, surgery may be considered to remove the excess skin (blepharoplasty). However, this operation isn\u2019t routinely funded on the NHS so your doctor would need to submit a funding request for this to be considered. If the edge of your upper lid droops down over your eye, it's called ptosis. This is usually age-related and develops slowly. Surgery may be needed if the edge of the lid droops so much your vision is affected. In rare cases, ptosis isn't related to age and may be caused by serious conditions such as myasthenia gravis or a brain tumour. In these cases, it's likely there would be other symptoms too. See your GP immediately if ptosis comes on rapidly, over days or weeks, or if it's associated with other symptoms, such as a headache, loss of vision or a change in the size of the pupil (the black dot at the centre of the eye). Lower eyelid that rolls outwards (ectropion)  As you get older, one or both lower eyelids can sometimes droop away from the eye and turn outwards. This is known as an ectropion. The drooping eyelid can disrupt the normal production of tears, which can cause your eye to become dry, red and irritated. Treatment may not be needed in mild cases, although drops or ointment may help make your eye more comfortable. Sometimes a minor operation is needed to correct the position of the eyelid. Read more about treating ectropion. Eyelids that roll inwards (entropion) Entropion is where the eyelid rolls inwards. It usually affects the lower lids, but it can also affect the upper lids. Like ectropion, this is often age-related. Entropion usually causes an uncomfortable watery eye because the lashes irritate the front of the eye (cornea). If this is mild, using eyedrops may be enough to protect the eye and keep you comfortable. Severe entropion can be painful and cause vision loss by damaging the cornea. Occasionally, a corneal ulcer can form and become infected. Surgery may be needed to correct entropion if it's posing a risk to the health of your eye or is causing considerable discomfort. This is carried out under local anaesthetic. If you have entropion, you should discuss your treatment options with your GP. Consult your GP immediately if your eye becomes painful and red and your vision is affected. Yellow plaques on the eyelids Flat yellow patches (plaques) over the upper or lower eyelids are called xanthelasma.  Although these plaques are harmless, they indicate you have high cholesterol. See your GP because you may be at risk of developing cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks and strokes. Making changes to your diet and taking medication may be recommended to reduce your cholesterol level and reduce your risk of serious problems in the future, although these may not improve the plaques. If you're bothered by the appearance of the plaques, it may be possible for them to be surgically removed or treated with a laser. However, this isn't normally funded on the NHS. Excessive blinking or uncontrollable closure of the eyelids It's quite common and normal for the eyelid to flicker or twitch occasionally, particularly when you're tired. It's more unusual to have repeated spasms of excessive blinking and involuntary closure of one or both eyes. This is a type of dystonia (a movement disorder that causes muscle spasms and contractions) known as blepharospasm. Each spasm can last for a few seconds to a few minutes. The exact cause of blepharospasm is unknown. However, the blinking and closure can be triggered by bright light, stress or tiredness. Severe blepharospasm can be very disabling and embarrassing. However, an effective treatment is available. It involves having small injections of botulinum toxin (such as Botox) into the face to relax the muscles controlling the eyelids. In some cases, your GP may consider referring you to a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nerves) for further investigation.

The symptoms are muscle weakness, tripping or falling, and fatigue (tiredness) after walking or standing. It can feel like permanently having the flu. If the throat or chest muscles are affected, it can cause difficulty swallowing or breathing. Myositis can result from infection, certain medications or, most commonly, an underlying problem with the immune system. Dermatomyositis and polymyositis are types of myositis caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the muscles as if they were invading germs. When the immune system attacks the body in this way, it's known as an autoimmune disease. What is dermatomyositis, and who is at risk? Dermatomyositis affects the skin as well as the muscles, and sometimes also affects the joints, lungs and heart. It causes skin rashes on the face and on the back of the hands. The muscles may feel painful and tender. Dermatomyositis is usually an autoimmune disease, but it is not known why the immune system malfunctions in this way. It can be associated with other autoimmune diseases, too, such as thyroid disease and diabetes, and can also be associated with cancer.  Dermatomyositis can affect adults or children, and is more common in women. There's no cure, but symptoms can be treated with medication. What is polymyositis, and who is at risk? Polymyositis affects many different muscles in the body, especially the shoulders, hips and thigh muscles, but there's no skin rash. The muscle weakness may vary from week to week or month to month, although it tends to steadily get worse without treatment. It can be difficult to get up from a chair, climb stairs, lift objects, and comb hair. The aching and muscle weakness can become so severe that even picking up a cup of tea is difficult. If neck muscles are affected, it may be difficult to hold the head up.  Like dermatomyositis, polymyositis is an autoimmune disease that can be associated with cancer and other autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes, thyroid disease and myasthenia gravis. It's more common in women than men, and tends to affect people aged between 30 and 60. How are these conditions treated? You may be referred to a physiotherapist, who can advise you on a manageable exercise programme to maintain muscle strength. Speech and language therapy may be needed if you have swallowing difficulties. Medication The main drug treatment for myositis is steroid medication, which can include: steroid creams for the affected areas of skin in dermatomyositis higher doses of steroid tablets if there is severe muscle weakness High doses of steroids can cause side effects such as weight gain, high blood pressure, diabetes, cataracts and osteoporosis. Learn more about the side effects of steroid medication. Doctors may prescribe an additional medication that suppresses the immune system, such as azathioprine, methotrexate or cyclophosphamide. These are slow to act, but in the long term may allow you to reduce the dose of steroids and therefore reduce the risk of their side effects. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may be needed in very severe cases of myositis if you have severe muscle weakness causing life-threatening breathing or swallowing problems.  It involves having an injection of normal antibodies from donated blood. This temporarily changes the way your immune system operates. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy can produce a rapid improvement in the symptoms of myositis, but these drugs are very expensive and the benefits usually only last a few weeks. It is therefore not suitable as a long-term treatment, and is usually only used to treat people who are seriously ill while they are waiting for other treatments to become effective.  What is the outlook? Some people with either dermatomyositis or polymyositis respond well to medication. They may sometimes be able to stop using all steroids when their symptoms stop (while they're \"in remission\"), although most patients need to continue to take immunosuppressant medications long term. In time \u2013 usually years \u2013 it may be possible for some patients to stop all immunosuppressant medication if they remain well. Other patients respond less well to medication and find the disease affects their everyday activities and quality of life.

Without prompt treatment, it will lead to blindness in the affected eye.  Warning signs and symptoms Most people will experience warning signs that indicate their retina is at risk of detaching before they lose their sight. These include: the sudden appearance of floaters \u2013 black dots, specks or streaks that float across your field of vision (usually only one eye is affected) a cobweb effect of lots of little floaters \u2013 others report a single large black floater that looks like a housefly sudden short flashes of light in the affected eye lasting no more than a second blurring or distortion of your vision Without treatment, sight in the affected eye will start to deteriorate. Most people describe this as a shadow or \"black curtain\" spreading across their vision. Retinal detachment usually only occurs in one eye. If your eye is affected, there is an up to one in 10 chance that retinal detachment will happen in your other eye. When to seek medical advice Contact your GP immediately if you get any of these warning signs. If this is not possible, telephone NHS 111 or your local out-of-hours service for advice. Causes The retina lies at the back of your eye and sends signals to the brain, allowing it to see. Without a blood supply, the nerve cells die which leads to a loss of sight. Retinal detachment is most often the result of the retina becoming thinner and more brittle with age and pulling away from the underlying blood vessels. It can also be caused by a direct injury to the eye, but this is less common. Read more about the causes of retinal detachment. Diagnosis If your GP suspects retinal detachment, it is likely you will be referred to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist), usually on the same day. The ophthalmologist will study the back of your eye with an ophthalmoscope (a magnifying glass connected to a light) and a slit lamp (a microscope that magnifies the eye while you rest your head on a chin rest). If there is a poor view of the retina, an ultrasound scan may also be used.  Treatment The quicker retinal detachment is treated, the less risk there is of permanently losing some or all of your vision in the affected eye. Most detached retinas can be successfully reattached with surgery. There are a number of different types of surgery available, depending on the individual. It can take months to fully recover from surgery on your eye. During this period you may have reduced vision, which means you may not be able to do some of your usual activities, such as driving or flying. Some people's eyesight does not fully return after surgery and they have permanently reduced peripheral (side) or central vision. This can happen even if the retina is reattached successfully. This risk is higher the longer the detachment was left untreated. Read more about treating retinal detachment and recovering from retinal detachment surgery. Who is affected? Retinal detachment is rare. Only one in every 10,000 people will develop it in any given year in the UK. As retinal detachment is associated with ageing, most cases affect older adults aged between 60 and 70. Retinal detachment caused by an injury can affect people of any age, including children.

DCD is thought to be around three or four times more common in boys than girls, and the condition sometimes runs in families. This topic is about DCD in children, although the condition often causes continued problems into adulthood.  Read about DCD in adults. Symptoms of DCD Early developmental milestones of crawling, walking, self-feeding and dressing may be delayed in young children with DCD, and drawing, writing and performance in sports are usually behind what is expected for their age. Although signs of the condition are present from an early age, children vary widely in their rate of development, and DCD isn't usually definitely diagnosed until a child with the condition is around five years old or more. Read about symptoms of DCD in children. When to seek medical advice Talk to your GP or health visitor \u2013 or a nurse, doctor or special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) at your child's school \u2013 if you have any concerns about your child's health or development. If necessary, they can refer your child to a community paediatrician, who will assess them and try to identify any developmental problems. Read about diagnosing DCD in children. Causes of DCD Carrying out co-ordinated movements is a complex process that involves many different nerves and parts of the brain. Any problem in this process could potentially lead to difficulties with movement and co-ordination. It's not usually clear why co-ordination doesn't develop as well as other abilities in children with DCD. However, a number of risk factors that can increase a child's likelihood of developing DCD have been identified. These include: being born prematurely \u2013 before the 37th week of pregnancy being born with a low birth weight having a family history of DCD \u2013 although it is not clear exactly which genes may be involved in the condition the mother drinking alcohol or taking illegal drugs while pregnant Treating DCD There's no cure for DCD, but a number of therapies can make it easier for children to manage their problems. These include: being taught ways of carrying out activities they find difficult \u2013 such as breaking down difficult movements into much smaller parts and practising them regularly adapting tasks to make them easier \u2013 such as using special grips on pens and pencils so they are easier to hold Although DCD doesn't affect how intelligent a child is, it can make it more difficult for them to learn and they may need extra help to keep up at school. Treatment for DCD will be tailored to your child and usually involves a number of different healthcare professionals working together. Although the physical co-ordination of a child with DCD will remain below average, this often becomes less of a problem as they get older. However, difficulties in school \u2013 particularly producing written work \u2013 can become much more prominent and require extra help from parents and teachers. Read about treating DCD in children. Childhood dyspraxia: James' story Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video. James was diagnosed in 2005 with dyspraxia, a disability that can affect movement and co-ordination. His mother describes James\u2019s symptoms and the methods used to improve his condition. Note: this video represents the parent's view of her child. Media last reviewed: 12\/05\/2016 Next review due: 12\/05\/2018 Dyspraxia or DCD? While many people in the UK use the term dyspraxia to refer to the difficulties with movement and co-ordination that first develop in young children, the term is used less often by health professionals nowadays. Instead, most healthcare professionals use the term developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD) to describe the condition. This term is generally preferred by healthcare professionals because, strictly speaking, dyspraxia can have several meanings. For example, dyspraxia can be used to describe movement difficulties that occur later in life as a result of damage to the brain, such as from a stroke or head injury. Some health professionals may also use the term specific developmental disorder of motor function (SDDMF) to refer to DCD.

It's sometimes known as congenital hip dislocation or hip dysplasia. The hip joint attaches the thigh bone (femur) to the pelvis. The top of the femur (femoral head) is rounded like a ball and sits inside the cup-shaped hip socket. In DDH, the socket of the hip is too shallow and the femoral head isn't held tightly in place, so the hip joint is loose. In severe cases, the femur can come out of the socket (dislocate). DDH may affect one or both hips but is more common in the left hip. It's also more common in girls and firstborn children. About 1 or 2 in every 1,000 babies have DDH that needs treating. Without treatment, DDH may lead to problems later in life, including: developing a limp hip pain \u2013 especially during the teenage years painful and stiff joints (osteoarthritis) With early diagnosis and treatment, most children are able to develop normally and have a full range of movement in their hip. Diagnosing DDH Within 72 hours of giving birth, your baby's hips will be checked as part of the newborn physical examination. Another hip examination is carried out when your baby is between six and eight weeks old. The examination involves gentle manipulation of your baby's hip joints to check if there are any problems, and shouldn't cause them any discomfort. An ultrasound scan is usually recommended within a few weeks if: the hip feels unstable there's a family history of childhood hip problems your baby was born in the breech position (feet first with their bottom downwards) you've had twins or a multiple birth your baby was born prematurely \u2013 before the 37th week of pregnancy Sometimes a baby's hip stabilises on its own before the scan is due. Treating DDH Pavlik harness Babies diagnosed with DDH early in life are usually treated with a fabric splint known as a Pavlik harness. This secures both of your baby's hips in a stable position and allows them to develop normally. The harness needs to be worn constantly for several weeks and shouldn't be removed by anyone except a health professional. The harness may be adjusted during follow-up appointments and your clinician will discuss your baby's progress with you. Your hospital will provide detailed instructions on how to look after your baby while they're in a Pavlik harness. This will include information on: how to change your baby's clothes without removing the harness (nappies can be worn normally) cleaning the harness if it's soiled \u2013 it still shouldn't be removed, but may be cleaned with detergent and an old toothbrush or nail brush positioning your baby while they sleep \u2013 they should be placed on their back and not on their side how to help avoid skin irritation around the straps of the harness \u2013 you may be advised to wrap some soft, hygienic material around the bands Eventually, you may be given advice on removing and replacing the harness for short periods of time until it can be permanently removed. You'll be encouraged to allow your baby to move freely when the harness is off and swimming is often recommended. Surgery Surgery may be needed if your baby is diagnosed with DDH after they're six months old, or if the Pavlik harness hasn't worked. The most common surgical technique is known as reduction, which involves placing the ball of the femur back into the hip socket. Reduction is carried out under general anaesthetic and may be performed as either: closed reduction \u2013 the ball is placed in the socket without making any large cuts (incisions) open reduction \u2013 an incision is made in the groin to allow the surgeon to place the ball in the socket Your child will need a hip cast for at least six weeks after surgery. Their hip will need to be checked under general anaesthetic again after this time to make sure it's stable and healing well. After this investigation, a cast will probably be needed for at least another six weeks to allow the hip to fully stabilise. Some children may also require bone surgery (osteotomy) during an open reduction, or at a later date to correct any bone deformities. Late-stage signs of DDH The newborn physical examination and the check at six to eight weeks aim to diagnose DDH early. However, sometimes hip problems can develop after these checks. It's important to contact your GP as soon as possible if you notice your child develops any of the following symptoms: restricted movement in one leg when you change their nappy one leg drags behind the other when they crawl one leg appears longer than the other uneven skin folds in the buttocks or thighs a limp, walking on toes or developing an abnormal 'waddling' walk Your child will be referred to an orthopaedic specialist in hospital for an ultrasound scan or an X-ray if your doctor thinks there's a problem with their hip. Preventing DDH It's important to remember that DDH can't be prevented and it's nobody's fault. A baby's hips are naturally more flexible for a short period after birth. However, if your baby spends a lot of time tightly wrapped with their legs straight and pressed together (swaddled), there's a risk this may slow their hip development. Using 'hip healthy' swaddling techniques can reduce this risk. Make sure your baby is able to move their hips and knees freely to kick. You can read about hip-healthy swaddling on The International Hip Dysplasia Institute website.

Neurological conditions are caused by disease or damage to the brain, spinal cord or nerves. NMO most commonly affects the optic nerves and spinal cord, which can lead to optic neuritis and transverse myelitis (see below). Some people may only experience optic neuritis or myelitis but may have the aquaporin-4 antibody (also see below). In such cases, a person is said to have an NMO spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Each person with NMO will experience different symptoms and require individually tailored care and support. Some of the main symptoms of NMO include: muscle weakness \u2013 reduced strength in one or more muscles that can affect mobility impaired eyesight nerve pain \u2013 which can be a sharp, burning, shooting or numbing pain spasms and increased muscle tone \u2013 from nerve damage that affects muscle control bladder, bowel and sexual problems NMO UK has more information about the symptoms of NMO. Optic neuritis Optic neuritis is inflammation of the nerve that leads from the eye to the brain. It causes a reduction or loss of vision, and can affect both eyes at the same time. Other symptoms of optic neuritis include eye pain, which is usually made worse by movement, and reduced colour vision where colours may appear \u2018washed out\u2019 or less vivid than usual. Transverse myelitis Transverse myelitis is inflammation of the spinal cord. It causes weakness in the arms and legs which can range from a mild 'heavy' feeling in one limb, to complete paralysis in all four limbs. It may cause numbness, tingling or burning below the affected area of the spinal cord and increased sensitivity to touch, cold and heat. There may also be tight and painful muscle contractions (known as tonic muscle spasms). Relapses in NMO An attack or relapse of NMO results in the nervous system becoming inflamed. The inflammation usually occurs in the optic nerve and spinal cord, and causes new symptoms or the recurrence of previous symptoms. Less common symptoms of NMO can include unexplained nausea and vomiting, unexplained itching and tonic spasms (painful muscle contractions). In someone with known NMO, these symptoms may signify a new relapse. NMO symptoms can range from mild to severe. In some cases, there may only be one attack of optic neuritis or transverse myelitis, with good recovery and no further relapses for a long time. However, in severe cases, there can be a number of attacks which lead to disability. Disability occurs because the body can't always fully recover from damage caused by the attacks on the spinal cord and optic nerve. NMO UK has more information about NMO relapses. What causes NMO? NMO is an autoimmune condition, which means a person\u2019s immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence against illness and infection) reacts abnormally and attacks the body's tissues and organs. An antibody against a protein called aquaporin-4 is present in the blood of up to 80% of people with NMO. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body to destroy disease-carrying organisms and toxins. In NMO, the immune system attacks aquaporin-4 which damages the myelin sheath (the protective layer that surrounds nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord and helps transmit nerve signals). Who's affected by NMO? NMO is a rare condition. In Europe, it's estimated that there's one case of NMO for every 100,000 people. In the UK, it's thought that NMO affects less than 1,000 people. NMO can affect anyone but it's more common in women than men, with about four females being affected for every male. Although the condition is thought to be more common in people of Asian and African descent, an increasing number of white (Caucasian) people are also being diagnosed. Diagnosing NMO It's important that NMO is correctly diagnosed. It can sometimes be confused with multiple sclerosis, which also affects the brain and spinal cord and has similar symptoms. However, the treatment is different. A neurology specialist will discuss your symptoms and medical history with you. You'll have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your brain and spinal cord. Some people with NMO (up to 60%) have lesions on their brain and spine, which are different to the lesions of someone with MS. A blood sample will be taken and tested for aquaporin-4 antibodies. A lumbar puncture is another test you may have. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is taken from the spine using a hollow needle that's inserted into the lower part of the spine. The fluid sample will be sent to a laboratory to be tested and to look for evidence of conditions affecting the brain, spinal cord or other parts of the nervous system. In some cases of transverse myelitis, there's an increase in the level of proteins or white cells. NMO UK has more information about how NMO is diagnosed. Treating NMO There's no cure for NMO, so treatment aims to manage attacks and symptoms, and prevent relapses. Every person with NMO is affected differently and some may have much milder symptoms than others. However, early treatment is usually needed to prevent further episodes and permanent disability. Medication is used to reduce nerve inflammation, suppress the immune system and treat any pain. Rehabilitation techniques, such as physiotherapy, can also help with any reduced mobility that the relapses cause. In the UK, NMO is recognised as a rare condition that requires specialist neurological input and two national referral centres have been designated. They are: The Walton Centre in Liverpool John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford At these centres, research is ongoing to find possible future treatments for NMO. To be referred to one of these centres, a GP referral letter is all that's needed. These specialist services are nationally funded, so GP practices won't have any additional costs for referring. NMO UK has more information about treatments for NMO. Driving Optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve) could affect your ability to drive. You have a legal obligation to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about any medical condition that could have an impact on your driving ability. See GOV.UK for more information about driving with a disability or health condition. Information about you If you have NMO, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

DEXA stands for \"dual energy X-ray absorptiometry\". This type of scan may also be called: a DXA scan a bone density scan a bone densitometry scan DEXA scans are often used to diagnose or assess someone's risk of osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones and makes them more likely to break. As well as being quick and painless, a DEXA scan is more effective than normal X-rays in identifying low bone mineral density. Osteoporosis You may need to have a DEXA scan if you're: over 50 years of age with a risk of developing osteoporosis under 50 with other risk factors \u2013 such as smoking or a previous fracture The World Health Organization (WHO) has created a 10-year Fracture Risk Assessment Tool, which applies to both men and women between 40 and 90 years of age. The tool can be used to assess if a DEXA scan is appropriate and calculates your risk of fracture in the next 10 years. Osteoporosis can affect people of both sexes and all ages, although older, post-menopausal women are particularly at risk. This is because after the menopause the level of oestrogen declines, resulting in a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD). The more dense your bones, the stronger and less likely they are to fracture (break). Osteoporosis doesn't cause any symptoms until a bone is broken. It used to be difficult to measure bone density and identify those at risk of developing osteoporosis until a fracture occurred. However, it's now possible to measure bone density before someone gets a fracture. Read more about when DEXA scans are used. Measuring bone density During a DEXA scan, X-rays are passed through your body. Some radiation is absorbed by the bone and soft tissue and some travels through your body. Special detectors in the DEXA scanner measure how much radiation passes through your bones, and this information is sent to a computer. Your bone density measurements will be compared with the bone density of a young healthy adult or an adult of your own age, gender and ethnicity. Read more about how DEXA scans are carried out. Safety DEXA scans use a much lower level of radiation than standard X-ray examinations, which means that the radiographer (the technical specialist carrying out the scan) can stay in the scanning room with you during the scan. The amount of radiation used during a DEXA scan varies depending on the area of the body being examined, but is very low and less than two days' exposure to natural background radiation (NBR). By comparison, a chest X-ray uses the equivalent of about three days' exposure to NBR, and a flight to North America is equivalent to approximately a week's exposure to NBR. Despite being very safe procedures, DEXA scans and X-rays aren't recommended for pregnant women, as X-rays can damage an unborn child. Read more about your health during pregnancy.

There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes \u2013 where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin type 2 diabetes \u2013 where the body doesn't produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't react to insulin Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. In the UK, around 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2. During pregnancy, some women have such high levels of blood glucose that their body is unable to produce enough insulin to absorb it all. This is known as gestational diabetes. Pre-diabetes Many more people have blood sugar levels above the normal range, but not high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes. This is sometimes known as pre-diabetes. If your blood sugar level is above the normal range, your risk of developing full-blown diabetes is increased. It's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it will get progressively worse if left untreated. When to see a doctor Visit your GP as soon as possible if you experience the main symptoms of diabetes, which include: feeling very thirsty urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night feeling very tired weight loss and loss of muscle bulk itching around the penis or vagina, or frequent episodes of thrush cuts or wounds that heal slowly blurred vision Type 1 diabetes can develop quickly over weeks or even days. Many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realising because the early symptoms tend to be general.

Causes of diabetes The amount of sugar in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach). When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it's broken down to produce energy. However, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there's either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced doesn't work properly. Although there are no lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk of type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes is often linked to being overweight. Read about how to reduce your diabetes risk. Living with diabetes If you're diagnosed with diabetes, you'll need to eat healthily, take regular exercise and carry out regular blood tests to ensure your blood glucose levels stay balanced. You can use the BMI healthy weight calculator to check whether you're a healthy weight. People diagnosed with type 1 diabetes also require regular insulin injections for the rest of their life. As type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, medication may eventually be required, usually in the form of tablets. Read about:  Treating type 1 diabetes Treating type 2 diabetes Living with diabetes Diabetic eye screening Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year. If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it's not treated. Screening, which involves a half-hour check to examine the back of the eyes, is a way of detecting the condition early so it can be treated more effectively. Read more about diabetic eye screening.

Diabetes insipidus isn't related to diabetes mellitus (usually just known as diabetes), but it does share some of the same signs and symptoms. The two main symptoms of diabetes insipidus are: extreme thirst (polydipsia) passing large amounts of urine, even at night (polyuria) In very severe cases of diabetes insipidus, up to 20 litres of urine can be passed in a day. Read more about the symptoms of diabetes insipidus. When to seek medical advice You should always see your GP if you're feeling thirsty all the time. Although it may not be diabetes insipidus, it should be investigated. Also see your GP if you're: passing more urine than normal \u2013 most healthy adults pass urine four to seven times in a 24 hour period passing small amounts of urine at frequent intervals \u2013 sometimes, this can occur along with the feeling that you need to pass urine immediately Children tend to urinate more frequently because they have smaller bladders. However, seek medical advice if your child urinates more than 10 times a day. Your GP will be able to carry out a number of tests to help determine what's causing the problem. Read more about diagnosing diabetes insipidus. What causes diabetes insipidus? Diabetes insipidus is caused by problems with a hormone called vasopressin (AVP), also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH). AVP plays a key role in regulating the amount of fluid in the body. It's produced by specialist nerve cells in a part of the brain known as the hypothalamus. AVP passes from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland where it's stored until needed. The pituitary gland releases AVP when the amount of water in the body becomes too low. It helps retain water in the body by reducing the amount of water lost through the kidneys, making the kidney produce more concentrated urine. In diabetes insipidus, the lack of production of AVP means the kidney can't make enough concentrated urine and too much water is passed from the body. In rare cases, the kidney doesn't respond to AVP. This causes a specific form of diabetes insipidus, called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. People feel thirsty as the body tries to compensate for the increased loss of water by increasing the amount of water taken in. Read more about the causes of diabetes insipidus. Who's affected by diabetes insipidus? Diabetes insipidus affects about one in 25,000 people in the general population. Adults are more likely to develop the condition but it can occur at any age. In rarer cases, diabetes insipidus can develop during pregnancy, known as gestational diabetes insipidus. Types of diabetes insipidus There are two main types of diabetes insipidus: cranial diabetes insipidus nephrogenic diabetes insipidus Cranial diabetes insipidus Cranial diabetes insipidus occurs when there's not enough AVP in the body to regulate urine production. Cranial diabetes insipidus is the most common type of diabetes insipidus. It can be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland \u2013 for example, after an infection, operation, brain tumour or head injury. In about one in three cases of cranial diabetes insipidus there's no obvious reason why the hypothalamus stops making enough AVP. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when there's enough AVP in the body but the kidneys fail to respond to it. It can be caused by kidney damage or, in some cases, inherited as a problem on its own. Some medications, particularly lithium (used to help stabilise mood in some people with specific mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder), can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Treating diabetes insipidus Treatment isn't always needed for mild cases of cranial diabetes insipidus. You just need to increase the amount of water you drink to compensate for the fluid lost through urination. If necessary, a medication called desmopressin can be used to replicate the functions of AVP. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is often treated with medications called thiazide diuretics which reduce the amount of urine the kidneys produce. Read more about the treating diabetes insipidus. Complications As diabetes insipidus increases water loss in the urine, the amount of water in the body can become low. This is known as dehydration. Rehydration with water can be used to treat mild dehydration. Severe dehydration will need to be treated in hospital. Read more about the complications of diabetes insipidus. Information about you If you have diabetes insipidus, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most common causes of sight loss among people of working age. It occurs when diabetes affects small blood vessels, damaging the part of the eye called the retina. When the blood vessels in the central area of the retina (the macula) are affected, it's known as diabetic maculopathy. People with diabetes should also see their optician every two years for a regular eye test. Diabetic eye screening is specifically for diabetic retinopathy and can't be relied upon for other conditions. This page covers: Why it's needed When it's offered Eye screening in pregnancy What happens during screening Results Private screening Why eye screening is needed Screening is a way of detecting the condition early before you notice any changes to your vision. Diabetic retinopathy doesn't usually cause any noticeable symptoms in the early stages. If retinopathy is detected early enough, treatment can stop it getting worse. Otherwise, by the time symptoms become noticeable, it can be much more difficult to treat. This is why the NHS Diabetic Eye Screening Programme was introduced. Everyone aged 12 and over with diabetes is offered screening once a year. Diabetic retinopathy is extremely unusual in children with diabetes who are under the age of 12.  The check takes about half an hour and involves examining the back of the eyes and taking photographs of the retina. When diabetic eye screening is offered Everyone with diabetes who is 12 years of age or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year. You should receive a letter from your local Diabetic Eye Screening Service inviting you to attend a screening appointment. The letter will include a leaflet about diabetic eye screening. People with diabetes can opt out of the screening programme if they choose. They should confirm this decision in writing to the screening service that has invited them for diabetic eye screening Contact your local screening service or your GP if you haven't received a letter and your appointment is overdue. You can look up your local screening service here \u2013 your service will be the one nearest to your GP surgery. The invitation will say where you need to go. This may be your GP surgery, your local hospital, a local optician's practice, or another nearby clinic. Bring all the glasses and contact lenses you wear, along with lens solution for contacts. If you have sight problems in between screening appointments, such as sudden vision loss or a deterioration in your vision, seek immediate medical advice. Don't wait until your next screening appointment. Diabetic eye screening in pregnancy If you have diabetes and become pregnant, you'll need special care as there are risks to both mother and baby associated with the condition. You'll be offered additional tests for diabetic retinopathy at or soon after your first antenatal clinic visit, and also after 28 weeks of pregnancy. If the early stages of retinopathy are found at the first screening, you'll also be offered another test between 16 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. If serious retinopathy is found at any screening, you'll be referred to an eye specialist. Some women who don't have diabetes can develop hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) during pregnancy. This is known as gestational diabetes. Pregnant women who develop gestational diabetes aren't offered screening for diabetic retinopathy. What happens during diabetic eye screening The screening appointment should last about 30 minutes. When you arrive, the procedure will be explained to you. If you have any questions, ask the healthcare professional who is treating you. You'll be given eye drops to enlarge your pupils, which takes between 15 and 20 minutes, and photographs of your retina will be taken.   There will be a flash of light each time a photograph is taken, but the camera won't touch your eye. Although the light is bright, it shouldn't be uncomfortable. The eye drops may cause your eyes to sting slightly, and after about 15 minutes your vision will be blurred. You may find it difficult to focus on objects that are close to you. Depending on the type of eye drops used, the blurring can last between two and six hours. You won't be able to drive home from your appointment, so you may want to bring someone with you. After the screening procedure, you may also find that everything looks very bright. You may want to take a pair of sunglasses to wear afterwards. Side effects In very rare cases, the eye drops can cause a sudden pressure increase within the eye. This requires prompt treatment at an eye unit. The symptoms of a pressure increase are: pain or severe discomfort in your eye redness of the white of your eye constantly blurred vision, sometimes with rainbow halos around lights If you experience any of these symptoms after screening, go back to the screening centre or your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Your screening results Within six weeks, both you and your GP should receive a letter letting you know your results. You won't get the results immediately as the photographs need to be studied by a number of different healthcare professionals, including someone who is trained in identifying and grading retinopathy. The screening results may show either: no retinopathy background retinopathy \u2013 also called stage one retinopathy degrees of referable retinopathy \u2013 this means retinopathy that requires referral to an eye specialist for further assessment and treatment You may need to have a further assessment if: the photographs aren't clear enough to give an accurate result you have retinopathy that could affect your sight and follow-up treatment is needed you have retinopathy that needs to be checked more than once a year other eye conditions are detected, such as glaucoma (a group of eye conditions that affect vision) or cataracts (cloudy patches in the lens of the eye) If your results show no retinopathy or background retinopathy, you'll be invited back for another screening appointment a year later. You can also reduce your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy in the future by controlling your blood sugar levels and blood pressure. Read more about preventing diabetic retinopathy. If screening detects signs that diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy is threatening your sight, you'll be given information about how far the condition has progressed. This will determine the type of treatment you receive. Read about the treatment options for diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy. If you have questions about your results, contact your local diabetic eye screening service. Their details should be on the letter you received from them. Alternatively, you can find your local screening service here. Private screening for diabetic retinopathy Eye checks for diabetic retinopathy are available privately but they won't necessarily be quality-assured in the same way as the NHS Diabetic Eye Screening Programme. If you're considering private screening, check that the company is properly regulated and ask for clear written information about the benefits as well as the risks of any tests offered. Find further information in the UK National Screening Committee's leaflet on private screening. Diabetic retinopathy screening Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

It occurs when the body is unable to use blood sugar (glucose) because there isn't enough insulin. Instead, it breaks down fat as an alternative source of fuel. This causes a build-up of a potentially harmful by-product called ketones.  Read more about the causes of diabetic ketoacidosis. It's fairly common in people with type 1 diabetes and can very occasionally affect those with type 2 diabetes. It sometimes develops in people who were previously unaware they had diabetes. Children and young adults are most at risk. It's important to seek medical advice quickly if you think that you or your child is experiencing the condition, because serious complications of diabetic ketoacidosis can develop if it's not treated early on. Warning signs to look out for If you take insulin to control your diabetes, you should keep an eye out for signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. Early signs and symptoms can include: passing large amounts of urine  feeling very thirsty feeling sick  abdominal (tummy) pain tiredness shortness of breath an increase in your blood sugar and\/or ketone levels \u2013 self-testing kits are available to check these (see below) You may become very dehydrated and if the condition isn't treated quickly, it can lead to vomiting, an increased breathing and heart rate, dizziness, drowsiness, a smell of pear drops or nail varnish on your breath, and loss of consciousness. Read more about the symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. What to do If you think that you or your child are experiencing early symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis, and self-testing shows you have a high blood glucose and\/or ketone level, you should immediately contact your diabetes care team or GP for advice. If this isn't possible, call your local out-of-hours service or NHS 111. If you or someone in your care appears to be experiencing more advanced symptoms, go immediately to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Treatment in hospital In most cases, people with diabetic ketoacidosis need to be treated in hospital. While in hospital, you'll usually receive a combination of: fluids pumped directly into a vein to rehydrate your body  insulin (usually pumped into a vein)   replacement of minerals you may have lost, such as potassium You'll be closely monitored to check how well you're responding to treatment. As long as there are no further problems, you should be able to leave hospital when you're well enough to eat and drink normally and tests show a safe level of ketones in your body. Before being discharged from hospital, a diabetes nurse will talk to you about why you developed diabetic ketoacidosis and help you come up with a plan to prevent future episodes. Read more about treating diabetic ketoacidosis.  Be aware of the danger If you have type 1 diabetes, you're at risk of diabetic ketoacidosis when your insulin level drops and your blood sugar level starts to rise (hyperglycaemia). This often occurs when you're ill with an infection such as flu or a urinary tract infection (UTI), as this causes the body to release extra hormones into your blood to help combat the illness. These hormones interfere with the effect of insulin, meaning that you need more insulin. It can also occur if you don't have enough insulin because you aren't following your recommended treatment plan correctly. A simple finger prick blood test can be used to detect an increase in blood sugar before it becomes a serious problem. Kits can also check the level of ketones in urine. You should monitor your blood sugar and ketone levels closely if you have type 1 diabetes, particularly when you're ill, so you can spot any increases early on. Generally speaking, a blood sugar reading of 11 mmol\/l or more is a sign that you're at risk of diabetic ketoacidosis and should check your ketone level if you feel ill. A ketone level reading of 2+ or more on urine strips or 0.6 mmol\/l or more in your blood is a sign that you need to take immediate action to correct your levels. Adjusting your insulin dose as advised by your diabetes care team will often correct your blood sugar and ketone levels, preventing diabetic ketoacidosis. Seek medical advice if your levels remain high after taking insulin or you develop the symptoms mentioned above.

It can cause blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated. However, it usually takes several years for diabetic retinopathy to reach a stage where it could threaten your sight. To minimise the risk of this happening, people with diabetes should: ensure they control their blood sugar levels, blood pressure and cholesterol attend diabetic eye screening appointments \u2013 annual screening is offered to all people with diabetes aged 12 and over to pick up and treat any problems early on This page covers: How diabetes can affect the eyes Am I at risk of diabetic retinopathy? Symptoms of diabetic retinopathy Diabetic eye screening Reduce your risk of diabetic retinopathy Treatments for diabetic retinopathy How diabetes can affect the eyes The retina is the light-sensitive layer of cells at the back of the eye that converts light into electrical signals. The signals are sent to the brain and the brain turns them into the images you see. The retina needs a constant supply of blood, which it receives through a network of tiny blood vessels. Over time, a persistently high blood sugar level can damage these blood vessels in three main stages: tiny bulges develop in the blood vessels, which may bleed slightly but don\u2019t usually affect your vision \u2013 this is known as background retinopathy more severe and widespread changes affect the blood vessels, including more significant bleeding into the eye \u2013 this is known as pre-proliferative retinopathy scar tissue and new blood vessels, which are weak and bleed easily, develop on the retina \u2013 this is known as proliferative retinopathy and it can result in some loss of vision However, if a problem with your eyes is picked up early, lifestyle changes and\/or treatment can stop it getting worse. Read about the stages of diabetic retinopathy. Am I at risk of diabetic retinopathy? Anyone with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes is potentially at risk of developing diabetic retinopathy. You're at a greater risk if you: have had diabetes for a long time have a persistently high blood sugar (blood glucose) level have high blood pressure have high cholesterol are pregnant are of Asian or Afro-Caribbean background By keeping your blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control, you can reduce your chances of developing diabetic retinopathy. Symptoms of diabetic retinopathy You won't usually notice diabetic retinopathy in the early stages, as it doesn't tend to have any obvious symptoms until it's more advanced.

It can occur at any stage of pregnancy, but is more common in the second half. It occurs if your body cannot produce enough insulin \u2013 a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels \u2013 to meet the extra needs in pregnancy. Gestational diabetes can cause problems for you and your baby during and after birth. But the risk of these problems happening can be reduced if it's detected and well managed. This page covers: Who's at risk Symptoms How it can affect your pregnancy Screening Treatments Long-term effects Future pregnancies Who's at risk of gestational diabetes Any woman can develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy, but you're at an increased risk if: your body mass index (BMI) is above 30 \u2013 use the healthy weight calculator to work out your BMI you previously had a baby who weighed 4.5kg (10lbs) or more at birth you had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy one of your parents or siblings has diabetes your family origins are south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean or Middle Eastern If any of these apply to you, you should be offered screening for gestational diabetes during your pregnancy. Symptoms of gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes doesn't usually cause any symptoms. Most cases are only picked up when your blood sugar level is tested during screening for gestational diabetes. Some women may develop symptoms if their blood sugar level gets too high (hyperglycaemia), such as: increased thirst needing to pee more often than usual a dry mouth tiredness But some of these symptoms are common during pregnancy anyway and aren't necessarily a sign of a problem. Speak to your midwife or doctor if you're worried about any symptoms you're experiencing. How gestational diabetes can affect your pregnancy Most women with gestational diabetes have otherwise normal pregnancies with healthy babies. However, gestational diabetes can cause problems such as: your baby growing larger than usual \u2013 this may lead to difficulties during the delivery and increases the likelihood of needing induced labour or a caesarean section polyhydramnios \u2013 too much amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby) in the womb, which can cause premature labour or problems at delivery premature birth \u2013 giving birth before the 37th week of pregnancy pre-eclampsia \u2013 a condition that causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and can lead to pregnancy complications if not treated your baby developing low blood sugar or yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) after he or she is born, which may require treatment in hospital the loss of your baby (stillbirth) \u2013 though this is rare Having gestational diabetes also means you're at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. Screening for gestational diabetes During your first antenatal appointment at around weeks 8 to 12 of your pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will ask you some questions to determine whether you're at an increased risk of gestational diabetes. If you have one or more risk factors for gestational diabetes \u2013 see Who's at risk, above \u2013 you should be offered a screening test. The screening test used is called an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which takes about two hours. It involves having a blood test taken in the morning when you've had nothing to eat or drink (except water) overnight. You're then given a glucose drink.  After resting for two hours, another blood sample is taken to see how your body is dealing with the glucose. The OGTT is done when you're between 24 and 28 weeks pregnant. If you've had gestational diabetes before, you'll be offered an OGTT earlier in pregnancy soon after your booking visit, and another OGTT at 24 to 28 weeks if the first test is normal. Alternatively, it may be suggested that you start testing your blood sugar yourself using a finger-pricking device in the same way as you did during your previous episode of gestational diabetes. Treatments for gestational diabetes In women with gestational diabetes, the chances of having problems with the pregnancy can be reduced by controlling blood sugar levels. You'll be given a blood sugar testing kit so you can monitor the effects of treatment. Blood sugar levels can be reduced by changes in diet and exercise.  But the majority of women will need medication as well if changes in diet and exercise don't reduce blood sugar enough. This may be tablets or insulin injections. You'll also be more closely monitored during your pregnancy and birth to check for any potential problems. If you have gestational diabetes, it's best to give birth before 41 weeks. Induction of labour or a caesarean section may be recommended if labour doesn't start naturally by this time. Earlier delivery may be recommended if there are concerns about your or your baby's health or if your blood sugar levels haven't been well controlled. Read more about how gestational diabetes is treated. Long-term effects of gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes normally goes away after birth. But women who've had it are more likely to develop: gestational diabetes again in future pregnancies type 2 diabetes \u2013 a lifelong type of diabetes You should have a blood test to check for diabetes 6 to 13 weeks after giving birth, and every year thereafter if the result is normal. See your GP if you develop symptoms of high blood sugar, such as increased thirst, needing to pee more often than usual, and a dry mouth \u2013 don't wait until your next test.  You should have the tests even if you feel well, as many people with diabetes don't have any symptoms.  You'll also be advised about things you can do to reduce your risk of developing diabetes, such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly. Some research has suggested that babies of mothers who had gestational diabetes may be more likely to develop diabetes or become obese later in life. Planning future pregnancies If you've had gestational diabetes before and you're planning to get pregnant, make sure you get checked for diabetes. Your GP can arrange this. If you do have diabetes, you should be referred to a diabetes pre-conception clinic for support to ensure your condition is well controlled before you get pregnant. Read more about diabetes in pregnancy. If you have an unplanned but wanted pregnancy, talk to your GP and tell them you had gestational diabetes in your previous pregnancy.   If tests show you don't have diabetes, you'll be offered screening earlier in pregnancy soon after your booking visit, and a repeat screening test at 24 to 28 weeks if the first test is normal. Alternatively, it may be suggested that you start testing your blood glucose yourself using a finger-pricking device in the same way as you did during your previous gestational diabetes.

The hormone insulin \u2013 produced by the pancreas \u2013 is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood. There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 \u2013 where the pancreas doesn't produce any insulin Type 2 \u2013 where the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin or the body\u2019s cells don't react to insulin This topic is about type 1 diabetes. Read more about type 2 diabetes. Another type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear following birth. It's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because it will get progressively worse if left untreated. You should therefore visit your GP if you have symptoms, which include feeling thirsty, passing urine more often than usual and feeling tired all the time (see the list below for more diabetes symptoms).  See your GP if you think you may have diabetes Results for Edit Find your GP's contact details Your location could not be found.

Type 1 and type 2 diabetes Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood. Around 10% of all diabetes is type 1, but it's the most common type of childhood diabetes. This is why it's sometimes called juvenile diabetes or early-onset diabetes.  In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas (a small gland behind the stomach) doesn't produce any insulin \u2013 the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels. This is why it's also sometimes called insulin-dependent diabetes. If the amount of glucose in the blood is too high, it can, over time, seriously damage the body's organs. In type 2 diabetes, the body either doesn't produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body's cells don't react to insulin. Around 90% of adults with diabetes have type 2, and it tends to develop later in life than type 1. Diabetes symptoms The symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means that glucose stays in the blood and isn\u2019t used as fuel for energy. Your body tries to reduce blood glucose levels by getting rid of the excess glucose in your urine. Typical symptoms include: feeling very thirsty passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night feeling very tired weight loss and loss of muscle bulk The symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop very quickly in young people (over a few days or weeks). In adults, the symptoms often take longer to develop (a few months). Read more about the symptoms of type 1 diabetes. Causes of type 1 diabetes  Type 1 diabetes occurs as a result of the body being unable to produce insulin, which moves glucose out of the blood and into your cells to be used for energy. Without insulin, your body will break down its own fat and muscle, resulting in weight loss. This can lead to a serious short-term condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, where the bloodstream becomes acidic and you develop dangerous levels of dehydration. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, where the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them. Read more about the causes of type 1 diabetes. Treating type 1 diabetes It's important that diabetes is diagnosed as early as possible, so that treatment can be started. Diabetes can't be cured, but treatment aims to keep your blood glucose levels as normal as possible and control your symptoms, to prevent health problems developing later in life. If you're diagnosed with diabetes, you'll be referred to a diabetes care team for specialist treatment and monitoring. As your body can't produce insulin, you'll need regular insulin injections to keep your glucose levels normal. You'll be taught how to do this and how to match the insulin you inject to the food you eat, taking into account your blood glucose level and how much exercise you do. Insulin injections come in several different forms, with each working slightly differently. Some last up to a whole day (long-acting), some last up to eight hours (short-acting) and some work quickly but don't last very long (rapid-acting). You'll most likely need a combination of different insulin preparations. There are alternatives to insulin injections, but they're only suitable for a small number of patients. They are: insulin pump therapy \u2013 where a small device constantly pumps insulin (at a rate you control) into your bloodstream through a needle that's inserted under the skin islet cell transplantation \u2013 where healthy insulin-producing cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor are implanted into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes (read about the criteria for having an islet transplant) a complete pancreas transplant Read more about diagnosing diabetes and treating type 1 diabetes. Complications If diabetes is left untreated, it can cause a number of different health problems. Large amounts of glucose can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs. Even a mildly raised glucose level that doesn't cause any symptoms can have damaging effects in the long term. Read more about the complications of type 1 diabetes. Living with diabetes If you have type 1 diabetes, you'll need to look after your health very carefully. Caring for your health will also make treating your diabetes easier and minimise your risk of developing complications. For example, eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly will lower your blood glucose level. Stopping smoking (if you smoke) will also reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it's not treated. Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year. Read more about living with diabetes.

The hormone insulin \u2013 produced by the pancreas \u2013 is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 \u2013 where the pancreas doesn't produce any insulin type 2 \u2013 where the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin or the body's cells don't react to insulin These pages are about type 2 diabetes. Read more about type 1 diabetes. Another type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear after birth. Symptoms of diabetes The symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means glucose stays in the blood and isn't used as fuel for energy. Your body tries to reduce blood glucose levels by getting rid of the excess glucose in your urine. Typical symptoms include: feeling very thirsty passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night feeling very tired weight loss and loss of muscle bulk Read more about the symptoms of type 2 diabetes. It's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible as it will get progressively worse if left untreated. Read about how type 2 diabetes is diagnosed.

Causes of type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn't produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body's cells don't react to insulin. This means glucose stays in the blood and isn't used as fuel for energy. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity and tends to be diagnosed in older people. It's far more common than type 1 diabetes. Read about the causes and risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Treating type 2 diabetes As type 2 diabetes usually gets worse, you may eventually need medication \u2013 usually tablets \u2013 to keep your blood glucose at normal levels. Read more about the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Complications of type 2 diabetes Diabetes can cause serious long-term health problems. It's the most common cause of vision loss and blindness in people of working age. Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year for diabetic retinopathy. Diabetes is also responsible for most cases of kidney failure and lower limb amputation, other than accidents. People with diabetes are up to five times more likely to have cardiovascular disease, such as a stroke, than those without diabetes. Read more about the complications of type 2 diabetes. Preventing type 2 diabetes If you're at risk of type 2 diabetes, you may be able to prevent it developing by making lifestyle changes. These include: eating a healthy, balanced diet losing weight if you're overweight, and maintaining a healthy weight stopping smoking if you smoke drinking alcohol in moderation taking plenty of regular exercise Living with type 2 diabetes If you already have type 2 diabetes, it may be possible to control your symptoms by making the above changes.

It often involves diverting blood to a machine to be cleaned. Normally, the kidneys filter the blood, removing harmful waste products and excess fluid and turning these into urine to be passed out of the body. Why do I need dialysis? If your kidneys aren't working properly, for example because you have advanced chronic kidney disease (kidney failure), the kidneys may not be able to clean the blood properly. Waste products and fluid can build up to dangerous levels in your body. Left untreated, this can cause a number of unpleasant symptoms and eventually be fatal. Dialysis filters out unwanted substances and fluids from the blood before this happens. How long will I need dialysis for? It depends. In some cases, kidney failure may be a temporary problem and dialysis can be stopped when your kidneys recover. But often, someone with kidney failure will need a kidney transplant. It's not always possible to carry out a kidney transplant straight away, so dialysis may be needed until a suitable donor kidney becomes available. If a kidney transplant isn't suitable for you, for example because you're not well enough to have a major operation, dialysis may be needed for the rest of your life. What happens during dialysis There are two main types of dialysis: haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Haemodialysis Haemodialysis is the most common type of dialysis and the one most people are aware of. During the procedure, a tube is attached to a needle in your arm. Blood passes along the tube and into an external machine that filters it, before it's passed back into the arm along another tube. This is usually carried out three days a week, with each session lasting around four hours. Peritoneal dialysis Peritoneal dialysis uses the inside lining of your abdomen (the peritoneum) as the filter, rather than a machine. Like the kidneys, the peritoneum contains thousands of tiny blood vessels, making it a useful filtering device. Before treatment starts, an incision is made near your belly button and a thin tube called a catheter is inserted through the incision and into the space inside your abdomen (the peritoneal cavity). This is left in place permanently. Fluid is pumped into the peritoneal cavity through the catheter. As blood passes through the blood vessels lining the peritoneal cavity, waste products and excess fluid are drawn out of the blood and into the dialysis fluid. The used fluid is drained into a bag a few hours later and replaced with fresh fluid. Changing the fluid usually takes about 30-40 minutes and normally needs to be repeated around four times a day. If you prefer, this can be done by a machine overnight while you sleep.   Read more about how dialysis is performed. Which type of dialysis is best? In many cases, you'll be able to choose which type of dialysis you want to have. The two techniques are equally effective for most people, but each has its own advantages and drawbacks. For example: haemodialysis means you'll have four treatment-free days a week, but the treatment sessions last longer and you may need to visit hospital each time peritoneal dialysis can be done quite easily at home and can sometimes be done while you sleep, but it needs to be done every day If you're able to choose the type of dialysis you prefer, your care team will discuss the pros and cons of each option with you to help you make a decision. Read more about the advantages and disadvantages of both types of dialysis. Side effects of dialysis Haemodialysis can cause itchy skin and muscle cramps. Peritoneal dialysis can put you at risk of developing peritonitis (infection of the thin membrane that surrounds your abdomen). Both types of dialysis can make you feel exhausted. Read more about the possible side effects of dialysis Life on dialysis Many people on dialysis have a good quality of life. If you're otherwise well, you should be able to: continue working or studying drive exercise go swimming go on holiday Most people can remain on dialysis for many years, although the treatment can only partially compensate for the loss of kidney function and having kidneys that don't work properly can place a significant strain on the body. Sadly, this means that people can die while on dialysis if they don't have a kidney transplant, particularly elderly people and those with other health problems. Someone who starts dialysis in their late 20s can expect to live for up to 20 years or longer, but adults over 75 may only survive for two to three years. However, it's important to be aware that survival rates of people on dialysis have improved over the past decade and are expected to continue improving in the future.

Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart, or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the diaphragm.   At a glance: facts about the diaphragm   How it works   Who can use it   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks   Where you can get it   A contraceptive diaphragm is inserted into the vagina before sex, and it covers the cervix so that sperm can't get into the womb (uterus). You need to use spermicide with it (spermicides kill sperm). The diaphragm must be left in place for at least six hours after sex. After that time, you take out the diaphragm and wash it (they're reusable). Diaphragms come in different sizes \u2013 you must be fitted for the correct size by a trained doctor or nurse. At a glance: contraceptive diaphragm When used correctly with spermicide, a diaphragm is 92-96% effective at preventing pregnancy \u2013 this means that between four and eight women out of every 100 who use a diaphragm as contraception will become pregnant within a year. There are no serious health risks. You only have to think about it when you have sex. You can put a diaphragm in several hours before you have sex. It can take time to learn how to use it. Some women develop cystitis (a bladder infection) when they use a diaphragm. Your doctor or nurse can check the size \u2013 switching to a smaller size may help. If you lose or gain more than 3kg (7lbs) in weight, or have a baby, miscarriage or abortion, you may need to be fitted with a new diaphragm. By using condoms as well as a diaphragm, you'll help to protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).   How the contraceptive diaphragm works Inserting a diaphragm  Removing a diaphragm Looking after your diaphragm You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you A diaphragm (like a cap) is a barrier method of contraception. It fits inside your vagina and prevents sperm from passing through the cervix (the entrance of your womb). Diaphragms are soft, thin domes made of latex (rubber) or silicone, and come in different shapes and sizes. To be effective in preventing pregnancy, diaphragms need to be used in combination with spermicide, which is a chemical that kills sperm. You only have to use a diaphragm when you have sex, but you must leave it in for at least six hours after the last time you had sex. You can leave it in for longer than this, but do not take it out before. When you first start using a diaphragm, a doctor or nurse will examine you and advise on the correct size or shape to suit you. They will show you how to put in and take out a diaphragm, and also how to use the spermicide, which must be applied every time you use the diaphragm. A diaphragm provides only limited protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If you're at a high risk of getting an STI \u2013 for example, you or your partner has more than one sexual partner \u2013 you may be advised to use another form of contraception.  Inserting a diaphragm Your doctor or nurse will show you how to put in a diaphragm. Diaphragms come with instructions and are all inserted in a similar way: With clean hands, put a small amount of spermicide on each side of the diaphragm (also putting a little spermicide on the rim may make the diaphragm easier to put in). Put your index finger on top of the diaphragm and squeeze it between your thumb and other fingers. Slide the diaphragm into your vagina, upwards. This should ensure that the diaphragm covers your cervix. Always check that your cervix is covered \u2013 it feels like a lump, a bit like the end of your nose. If your cervix is not covered, take the diaphragm out by hooking your finger under the rim or loop (if there is one) and pulling downwards, then try again. Some women squat while they put their diaphragm in; others lie down or stand with one foot up on a chair \u2013 use the position that's easiest for you. You can insert a diaphragm up to three hours before you have sex \u2013 after this time, you will need to take it out and put some more spermicide on it. You may be fitted with a temporary diaphragm by your doctor or nurse. This is for you to practise with at home. It allows you to learn how to use it properly, see how it feels and find out if the method is suitable for you. During this time, you are not protected against pregnancy and need to use additional contraception, such as condoms, when you have sex. When you go back for a follow-up appointment with your doctor or nurse, wear the diaphragm so they can check that it is the right size and you have put it in properly. When they are happy that you can use a diaphragm properly, they will give you one to use as contraception. Removing a diaphragm A diaphragm can be easily removed by gently hooking your finger under its rim, loop or strap and pulling it downwards and out. You must leave all types of diaphragm in place for at least six hours after the last time you had sex. You can leave them in for longer than this, but do not leave them in for longer than the recommended time of 30 hours (including the minimum six).  Looking after your diaphragm  After using, you can wash your diaphragm with warm water and mild unperfumed soap. Rinse it thoroughly, then leave it to dry. You will be given a small container for it, which you should keep in a cool, dry place. Never boil a diaphragm. Do not use disinfectant, detergent, oil-based products or talcum powder to keep it clean, as these products can damage it.  Your diaphragm may become discoloured over time, but this does not make it less effective. Always check your diaphragm or cap for any signs of damage before using it.  You can visit your GP or nurse when you want to replace your diaphragm. Most women can use the same diaphragm for a year before they need to replace it. You may need to get a different size diaphragm if you gain or lose more than 3kg (7lb) in weight, or if you have a baby, miscarriage or abortion. Who can use a diaphragm? Most women are able to use a diaphragm. However, they may not be suitable for you if you:  have an unusually shaped or positioned cervix (entrance to the womb), or if you cannot reach your cervix  have weakened vaginal muscles (possibly as a result of giving birth) that cannot hold a diaphragm in place have a sensitivity or an allergy to latex or the chemicals in spermicide  have ever had toxic shock syndrome (a rare but life-threatening bacterial infection)  have repeated urinary tract infections (infection of the urinary system, such as the urethra, bladder or kidneys)  currently have a vaginal infection (wait until your infection clears before using a diaphragm or cap)  are not comfortable touching your vagina  have a high risk of getting an STI \u2013 for example, if you have multiple sexual partners Research shows that spermicides which contain the chemical nonoxynol-9 do not protect against STIs and may even increase your risk of getting an infection. A diaphragm may be less effective if: it is damaged \u2013 for example, it is torn or has holes  it is not the right size for you you use it without spermicide  you do not use extra spermicide with your diaphragm every time you have more sex  you remove it too soon (less than six hours after the last time you had sex) you use oil-based products, such as baby lotion, bath oils, moisturiser or some vaginal medicines (for example, pessaries) with latex diaphragms \u2013 these can damage the latex If any of these things happen, or you have had sex without contraception, you may need to use emergency contraception. You can use a diaphragm after having a baby, but you may need a different size. It is recommended that you wait at least six weeks after giving birth before using a diaphragm. You can use a diaphragm after a miscarriage or abortion, but you may need a different size. Advantages and disadvantages A diaphragm has the following advantages: You only need to use a diaphragm when you want to have sex. You can put it in at a convenient time before having sex (but do not forget to use extra spermicide if you have it in for more than three hours). There are no serious associated health risks or side effects. You are in control of your contraception. A diaphragm has the following disadvantages: It is not as effective as other types of contraception. It only provides limited protection against STIs. It can take time to learn how to use it. Putting it in can interrupt sex. Cystitis (bladder infection) can be a problem for some women who use a diaphragm. Latex and spermicide can cause irritation in some women and their sexual partners. Risks  There are no health risks associated with using a contraceptive diaphragm. Where you can get a diaphragm Most types of contraception are free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics  some genitourinary (GUM) clinics sexual health clinics \u2013 they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people's services (call the Sexual Health Line on 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching by postcode or town. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacists won't tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse.

It affects most people from time to time and is usually nothing to worry about. However, it can be distressing and unpleasant until it passes, which normally takes a few days to a week. What causes diarrhoea? There are many different causes of diarrhoea, but a bowel infection (gastroenteritis) is a common cause in both adults and children. Gastroenteritis can be caused by: a virus \u2013 such as norovirus or rotavirus bacteria \u2013 such as campylobacter and Escherichia coli (E. coli), which are often picked up from contaminated food  a parasite \u2013 such as the parasite that causes giardiasis, which is spread in contaminated water These infections can sometimes be caught during travel abroad, particularly to areas with poor standards of public hygiene. This is known as travellers' diarrhoea. Diarrhoea can also be the result of anxiety, a food allergy, medication, or a long-term condition, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Read more about the causes of diarrhoea. What to do if you have diarrhoea Most cases of diarrhoea clear up after a few days without treatment, and you may not need to see your GP. However, diarrhoea can lead to dehydration, so you should drink plenty of fluids \u2013 small, frequent sips of water \u2013 until it passes. It's very important that babies and small children do not become dehydrated. Your pharmacist may suggest you use an oral rehydration solution (ORS) if you or your child are particularly at risk of dehydration. You should eat solid food as soon as you feel able to. If you're breastfeeding or bottle feeding your baby and they have diarrhoea, you should try to feed them as normal. Stay at home until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea to prevent spreading any infection to others. Medications to reduce diarrhoea, such as loperamide, are available. However, these are not usually necessary, and most types should not be given to children. Read more about treating diarrhoea. When to see your GP Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if you're concerned about yourself or your child. It's important to see your GP if the diarrhoea is particularly frequent or severe, or associated with other symptoms, such as: blood in your or your child's poo persistent vomiting a severe or continuous stomach ache weight loss signs of dehydration \u2013 including drowsiness, passing urine infrequently, and feeling lightheaded or dizzy your poo is dark or black \u2013 this may be a sign of bleeding inside your stomach You should also contact your GP if your or your child's diarrhoea is particularly persistent, as this may be a sign of a more serious problem. In most cases, diarrhoea should pass within about a week. Read more about when to contact your GP and diagnosing diarrhoea. Preventing diarrhoea Diarrhoea is often caused by an infection. You can reduce your risk by making sure you maintain high standards of hygiene. For example, you should: wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after going to the toilet and before eating or preparing food clean the toilet, including the handle and the seat, with disinfectant after each bout of diarrhoea avoid sharing towels, flannels, cutlery, or utensils with other household members It's also important to practise good food and water hygiene while travelling abroad, such as avoiding potentially unsafe tap water and undercooked food.

Also known as a stomach or tummy bug, it's usually caused by an infection. Most babies and toddlers who have diarrhoea and vomiting don't need treatment and you can safely look after them at home. However, it's important to look out for signs of dehydration. Babies and toddlers can become dehydrated more quickly than older children when they have diarrhoea and vomiting. If dehydration becomes severe it can be dangerous, particularly in young babies. It's also important to be careful with hygiene while your child is ill to stop diarrhoea and vomiting spreading. Looking after a baby or toddler with diarrhoea and vomiting When to get medical advice When to seek medical help urgently How to rehydrate your child with ORS solution Caring for your child once they're rehydrated How to stop diarrhoea and vomiting spreading Looking after a baby or toddler with diarrhoea and vomiting Carry on offering babies their usual milk feeds. Bottle fed babies can also have drinks of water between feeds. Keep giving them formula at the usual strength \u2013 never water it down. Toddlers over one can have other drinks, such as full-fat cows' milk, but avoid fruit juice and fizzy drinks as these can make diarrhoea worse. If your child is having solid foods, offer them food as usual if they seem to want it. If you wish, you can give your baby oral rehydration salt (ORS) solution to help prevent dehydration. This is available from your pharmacist. If you are worried about your child, you can speak to your GP, health visitor or pharmacist, or call NHS 111 for advice. When to get medical advice Vomiting usually lasts for 1-2 days, while diarrhoea lasts for about 5-7 days. If your child's symptoms last longer than this, or if they are showing signs of dehydration, speak to your GP. Signs of dehydration in a baby or toddler Your child may be dehydrated if they have: sunken eyes in young babies, a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head few or no tears when they cry a dry mouth fewer wet nappies dark yellow urine See other signs of dehydration. When to get medical help urgently Get medical advice urgently if your baby or toddler: seems to be deteriorating rather than getting better has a temperature of over 38C (100.4F) for a baby less than three months old, or over 39C (102.2F) for a baby aged three to six months old. (Over six months a child's temperature isn't the most useful indicator of how seriously ill they are.) Read more about how to take your baby's temperature. has blood or mucus in their poo has bile-stained (green) vomit has severe abdominal pain See other signs of serious illness in young children. How to rehydrate your child with ORS solution If your baby becomes dehydrated, they will need to be rehydrated with oral rehydration salt (ORS) solution, which is available from your pharmacist or GP. They will explain how to use it. The ORS solution helps replace the water and salts lost from your child's body because of the diarrhoea and vomiting. To rehydrate your baby or toddler, you need to offer them small amounts of ORS solution frequently over a period of about four hours. If your child is breastfed, keep offering them breastfeeds as well. If your child isn't breastfed, don't offer them any other drinks apart from the ORS solution unless a health professional suggests it. Don't offer your child any food while they are having the ORS solution. If your baby or toddler keeps vomiting the solution back up or won't drink it, speak to your GP. Don't give your child anti-diarrhoea drugs unless advised to by a health professional. Caring for your child once they're rehydrated Once your child is rehydrated, they can start to eat solid food again. Offer them plenty of their usual drinks, including milk feeds, but avoid fruit juice or fizzy drinks. If your child has more episodes of diarrhoea you may be advised to give them some ORS solution after each bout. How to stop diarrhoea and vomiting spreading Make sure everyone in the family washes their hands frequently, preferably using liquid soap with warm running water. They also need to dry their hands properly. It's particularly important for everyone to wash their hands after going to the toilet or changing a nappy and before eating. Anyone who has diarrhoea and vomiting should have their own towel to use. Babies or children who have diarrhoea and vomiting should be kept away from childcare or school for at least 48 hours after the last bout of diarrhoea or vomiting. Babies or children shouldn't swim in public swimming pools for two weeks after diarrhoea and vomiting has stopped. Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

Other symptoms of dysentery can include: painful stomach cramps nausea or vomiting a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above, or 37.5C (99.5F) or above in children under five In the UK, most people with dysentery only experience mild symptoms. It's not always necessary to see a GP, as it tends to clear up within a week or so. See your GP if your symptoms are severe or don't start to improve after a few days. Tell them if you have recently been abroad. Treating dysentery Treatment isn't normally needed, as it usually clears up on its own. However, it's important to make sure you drink plenty of fluids and use oral rehydration solutions (ORS) if necessary, to avoid dehydration. See treating diarrhoea for more information on this. Over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol can help to relieve pain and a fever. It's best to avoid antidiarrhoeal medications such as loperamide, as they can make things worse. You should stay at home until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea, to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to others. If your symptoms are severe or persistent, your GP may prescribe a short course of antibiotics. In severe cases, you may need to be treated in hospital for a few days. What causes dysentery? There are two main types of dysentery: bacillary dysentery or shigellosis \u2013 caused by shigella bacteria; this is the most common type of dysentery in the UK amoebic dysentery or amoebiasis \u2013 caused by an amoeba (single-celled parasite) called Entamoeba histolytica, that's found mainly in tropical areas; this type of dysentery is usually picked up abroad Both types of dysentery are highly infectious and can be passed on if the poo of an infected person gets into another person's mouth. This can happen if someone with the infection doesn't wash their hands after going to the toilet and then touches food, surfaces, or another person. In the UK, the infection usually affects groups of people in close contact, such as families, schools and nurseries. There is also a chance of picking up the infection through anal or anal-oral sex (\"rimming\"). In developing countries with poor sanitation, infected poo may contaminate the water supply or food (particularly cold, uncooked food). Preventing dysentery You can reduce your risk of getting dysentery with good hygiene. You should: wash your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet, and regularly throughout the day wash your hands before handling, eating or cooking food avoid sharing towels wash the laundry of an infected person on the hottest setting possible Read more about food safety and hygiene in the home. If you're travelling to a country where there is a high risk of getting dysentery, the advice below can help to prevent infection. Don't drink the local water unless you're sure that it's sterile (clean) \u2013 safe alternatives are bottled water or drinks in sealed cans or bottles. If the water is not sterile, boil it for several minutes or use chemical disinfectant or a reliable filter. Don't clean your teeth with tap water. Don't have ice in your drinks, because it may be made from unclean water. Avoid fresh fruit or vegetables that can't be peeled before eating. Avoid food and drink sold by street vendors (except drinks from properly sealed cans or bottles). Read more about food and water safety abroad.

It's not usually serious and most people get better within a few days without treatment. In most cases of food poisoning, the food is contaminated by bacteria, such as salmonella or Escherichia coli (E. coli), or a virus, such as the norovirus. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of food poisoning usually begin within one to two days of eating contaminated food, although they may start at any point between a few hours and several weeks later. The main symptoms include: feeling sick (nausea) vomiting diarrhoea, which may contain blood or mucus stomach cramps and abdominal (tummy) pain a lack of energy and weakness loss of appetite a high temperature (fever) aching muscles chills In most cases, these symptoms will pass in a few days and you will make a full recovery. What to do Most people with food poisoning recover at home and don't need any specific treatment, although there are some situations where you should see your GP for advice (see below).

It's usually caused by a bacterial or viral tummy bug. It affects people of all ages, but is particularly common in young children. Most cases in children are caused by a virus called rotavirus. Cases in adults are usually caused by norovirus (the \"winter vomiting bug\") or bacterial food poisoning. Gastroenteritis can be very unpleasant, but it usually clears up by itself within a week. You can normally look after yourself or your child at home until you're feeling better. Try to avoid going to your GP, as gastroenteritis can spread to others very easily. Call NHS 111 or your GP if you're concerned or need any advice. This page covers: Symptoms of gastroenteritis What to do if you have gastroenteritis When to get medical advice Looking after a child with gastroenteritis Getting medical advice for your child How gastroenteritis is spread Preventing gastroenteritis Symptoms of gastroenteritis The main symptoms of gastroenteritis are: sudden, watery diarrhoea feeling sick vomiting, which can be projectile a mild fever Some people also have other symptoms, such as a loss of appetite, an upset stomach, aching limbs and headaches. The symptoms usually appear up to a day after becoming infected. They typically last less than a week, but can sometimes last longer. What to do if you have gastroenteritis If you experience sudden diarrhoea and vomiting, the best thing to do is stay at home until you're feeling better. There's not always a specific treatment, so you have to let the illness run its course. You don't usually need to get medical advice, unless your symptoms don't improve or there's a risk of a more serious problem (see When to get medical advice). To help ease your symptoms: Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration \u2013 You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Water is best, but you could also try fruit juice and soup. Take paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains. Get plenty of rest. If you feel like eating, try small amounts of plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread. Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if you have signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth or dark urine \u2013 read about treating dehydration. Take anti-vomiting medication (such as metoclopramide) and\/or antidiarrhoeal medication (such as loperamide) if you need to \u2013 some types are available from pharmacies, but check the leaflet that comes with the medicine. You can also ask your pharmacist or GP for advice about whether they're suitable.  Gastroenteritis can spread very easily, so you should wash your hands regularly while you're ill and stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after your symptoms have cleared, to reduce the risk of passing it on (see Preventing gastroenteritis). When to get medical advice You don't normally need to see your GP if you think you have gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own. Visiting your GP surgery can put others at risk, so it's best to call NHS 111 or your GP if you're concerned or feel you need advice. Get medical advice if: you have symptoms of severe dehydration, such as persistent dizziness, only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or if you're losing consciousness you have bloody diarrhoea you're vomiting constantly and are unable to keep down any fluids you have a fever over 38C (100.4F) your symptoms haven't started to improve after a few days in the last few weeks you've returned from a part of the world with poor sanitation you have a serious underlying condition, such as kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease or a weak immune system, and have diarrhoea and vomiting Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your poo to a laboratory to check what's causing your symptoms. Antibiotics may be prescribed if this shows you have a bacterial infection. Looking after a child with gastroenteritis You can look after your child at home if they have diarrhoea and vomiting. There's not usually any specific treatment and your child should start feeling better in a few days. You don't normally need to get medical advice unless their symptoms don't improve or there's a risk of a more serious problem (see Getting medical advice for your child). To help ease your child's symptoms: Encourage them to drink plenty of fluids. They need to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Water is generally best. Avoid giving them fizzy drinks or fruit juice, as they can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds. Make sure they get plenty of rest. Let your child eat if they're eating solids and feel hungry. Try small amounts of plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread. Give them paracetamol if they have an uncomfortable fever or aches and pains. Young children may find liquid paracetamol easier to swallow than tablets. Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if they're dehydrated. Your GP or pharmacist can advise on how much to give your child. Don't give them antidiarrhoeal and anti-vomiting medication, unless advised to by your GP or pharmacist. Make sure you and your child wash your hands regularly while your child is ill and keep them away from school or nursery until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared (see Preventing gastroenteritis). Getting medical advice for your child You don't usually need to see your GP if you think your child has gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own, and taking them to a GP surgery can put others at risk. Call NHS 111 or your GP if you're concerned about your child, or they: have symptoms of dehydration, such as passing less urine than normal, being unusually irritable or unresponsive, pale or mottled skin, or cold hands and feet have blood in their poo or green vomit are vomiting constantly and are unable to keep down any fluids or feeds have had diarrhoea for more than a week have been vomiting for three days or more have signs of a more serious illness, such as a high fever (over 38C or 100.4F), shortness of breath, rapid breathing, a stiff neck, a rash that doesn't fade when you roll a glass over it or a bulging fontanelle (the soft spot on a baby's head) have a serious underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease or a weak immune system, and have diarrhoea and vomiting Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your child's poo to a laboratory to confirm what's causing their symptoms. Antibiotics may be prescribed if this shows they have a bacterial infection. How gastroenteritis is spread The bugs that cause gastroenteritis can spread very easily from person to person. You can catch the infection if small particles of vomit or poo from an infected person get into your mouth, such as through: close contact with someone with gastroenteritis \u2013 they may breathe out small particles of vomit touching contaminated surfaces or objects  eating contaminated food \u2013 this can happen if an infected person doesn't wash their hands before handling food, or you eat food that has been in contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, or hasn't been stored and cooked at the correct temperatures (read more about the causes of food poisoning) A person with gastroenteritis is most infectious from when their symptoms start until 48 hours after all their symptoms have passed, although they may also be infectious for a short time before and after this. Preventing gastroenteritis It's not always possible to avoid getting gastroenteritis, but following the advice below can help stop it spreading: Stay off work, school or nursery until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have passed. You or your child should also avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time. Ensure you and your child wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, particularly after using the toilet and before preparing food. Don't rely on alcohol hand gels, as they're not always effective. Disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated. It's best to use a bleach-based household cleaner. Wash contaminated items of clothing or bedding separately on a hot wash. Don't share towels, flannels, cutlery or utensils while you or your child is ill. Flush away any poo or vomit in the toilet or potty and clean the surrounding area. Practice good food hygiene. Make sure food is properly refrigerated, always cook your food thoroughly, and never eat food that is past its use-by date \u2013 read more about preventing food poisoning.  Take extra care when travelling to parts of the world with poor sanitation, as you could pick up a stomach bug. For example, you may need to boil tap water before drinking it. Young children can have the rotavirus vaccination when they\u2019re two to three months old, which can reduce their risk of developing gastroenteritis.

Try to avoid going to your GP, as norovirus can spread to others very easily. Call your GP or NHS 111 if you're concerned or need any advice. This page covers: Symptoms of norovirus What to do if you have norovirus When to get medical advice How is norovirus spread? Preventing norovirus Symptoms of norovirus The symptoms of norovirus are very distinctive. You're likely to have norovirus if you experience: suddenly feeling sick projectile vomiting watery diarrhoea Some people also have a slight fever, headaches, painful stomach cramps and aching limbs. The symptoms appear one to two days after you become infected and typically last for up to two or three days. What to do if you have norovirus If you experience sudden diarrhoea and vomiting, the best thing to do is to stay at home until you're feeling better. There's no cure for norovirus, so you have to let it run its course. You don't usually need to get medical advice unless there's a risk of a more serious problem (see When to get medical advice). To help ease your own or your child\u2019s symptoms: Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea \u2013 as well as water, adults could also try fruit juice and soup.

Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if you have signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth or dark urine \u2013 read more about treating dehydration. Adults can take antidiarrhoeal and\/or anti-emetic (anti-vomiting) medication \u2013 these are not suitable for everyone though, so you should check the medicine leaflet or ask or your pharmacist or GP for advice before trying them. Babies and young children, especially if they're less than a year old, have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated. Read advice about looking after babies and children under five who have diarrhoea and vomiting. Norovirus can spread very easily, so you should wash your hands regularly while you're ill and stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have cleared, to reduce the risk of passing it on (see Preventing norovirus below). When to get medical advice You don't normally need to see your GP if you think you or your child has norovirus, as there's no specific treatment for it.  Antibiotics won't help because it's caused by a virus. Visiting your GP surgery with norovirus can put others at risk, so it's best to call your GP or NHS 111 if you're concerned or feel you need advice. Get medical advice if: your baby or child has passed six or more watery stools in the past 24 hours, or has vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours your baby or child is less responsive, feverish, or has pale or mottled skin you or your child has symptoms of severe dehydration, such as persistent dizziness, only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or reduced consciousness \u2013 babies and elderly people have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated you have bloody diarrhoea your symptoms haven't started to improve after a few days you or your child have a serious underlying condition, such as kidney disease, and have diarrhoea and vomiting Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your stool to a laboratory to confirm whether you have norovirus or another infection. How is norovirus spread? Norovirus spreads very easily in public places such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools. You can catch it if small particles of vomit or poo from an infected person get into your mouth, such as through: close contact with someone with norovirus \u2013 they may breathe out small particles containing the virus that you could inhale touching contaminated surfaces or objects \u2013 the virus can survive outside the body for several days eating contaminated food \u2013 this can happen if an infected person doesn't wash their hands before handling food A person with norovirus is most infectious from when their symptoms start until 48 hours after all their symptoms have passed, although they may also be infectious for a short time before and after this. You can get norovirus more than once because the virus is always changing, so your body is unable to build up long-term resistance to it. Preventing norovirus It's not always possible to avoid getting norovirus, but following the advice below can help stop the virus spreading. Stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have passed. You should also avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, particularly after using the toilet and before preparing food. Don't rely on alcohol hand gels, as they do not kill the virus. Disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated. It's best to use a bleach-based household cleaner. Wash any items of clothing or bedding that could have become contaminated separately on a hot wash to ensure the virus is killed. Don't share towels and flannels. Flush away any infected poo or vomit in the toilet and clean the surrounding area. Avoid eating raw, unwashed produce and only eat oysters from a reliable source, as oysters can carry norovirus.

It's a common problem thought to regularly affect around one in every three people in the UK, and is particularly common in elderly people. If you have insomnia, you may: find it difficult to fall asleep lie awake for long periods at night wake up several times during the night wake up early in the morning and not be able to get back to sleep not feel refreshed when you get up find it hard to nap during the day, despite feeling tired feel tired and irritable during the day and have difficulty concentrating Occasional episodes of insomnia may come and go without causing any serious problems, but for some people it can last for months or even years at a time. Persistent insomnia can have a significant impact on your quality of life. It can limit what you're able to do during the day, affect your mood, and lead to relationship problems with friends, family and colleagues. How much sleep do I need? There are no official guidelines about how much sleep you should get each night because everyone is different. On average, a \"normal\" amount of sleep for an adult is considered to be around seven to nine hours a night. Children and babies may sleep for much longer than this, whereas older adults may sleep less. What's important is whether you feel you get enough sleep, and whether your sleep is good quality. You're probably not getting enough good-quality sleep if you constantly feel tired throughout the day and it's affecting your everyday life. Try the sleep self-assessment to see if you have trouble sleeping. What causes insomnia? It's not always clear what triggers insomnia, but it's often associated with: stress and anxiety a poor sleeping environment \u2013 such as an uncomfortable bed, or a bedroom that's too light, noisy, hot or cold lifestyle factors \u2013 such as jet lag, shift work, or drinking alcohol or caffeine before going to bed mental health conditions \u2013 such as depression and schizophrenia physical health conditions \u2013 such as heart problems, other sleep disorders and long-term pain certain medicines \u2013 such as some antidepressants, epilepsy medicines and steroid medication Read more about the causes of insomnia. What you can do about it There are a number of things you can try to help yourself get a good night's sleep if you have insomnia. These include: setting regular times for going to bed and waking up relaxing before bed time \u2013 try taking a warm bath or listening to calming music using thick curtains or blinds, an eye mask and earplugs to stop you being woken up by light and noise avoiding caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, heavy meals and exercise for a few hours before going to bed not watching TV or using phones, tablets or computers shortly before going to bed  not napping during the day writing a list of your worries, and any ideas about how to solve them, before going to bed to help you forget about them until the morning Some people find over-the-counter sleeping tablets helpful, but they don't address the underlying problem and can have troublesome side effects. Read more self-help tips for insomnia. When to see your GP Make an appointment to see your GP if you're finding it difficult to get to sleep or stay asleep and it's affecting your daily life \u2013 particularly if it has been a problem for a month or more and the above measures have not helped. Your GP may ask you about your sleeping routines, your daily alcohol and caffeine consumption, and your general lifestyle habits, such as diet and exercise. They will also check your medical history for any illness or medication that may be contributing to your insomnia. Your GP may suggest keeping a sleep diary for a couple of weeks to help them gain a better understanding of your sleep patterns. Each day, make a note of things such as the time you went to bed and woke up, how long it took you to fall asleep, and the number of times you woke up during the night. Treatments for insomnia Your GP will first try to identify and treat any underlying health condition, such as anxiety, that may be causing your sleep problems. They'll probably also discuss things you can do at home that may help to improve your sleep. In some cases, a special type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) designed for people with insomnia (CBT-I) may be recommended. This is a type of talking therapy that aims to help you avoid the thoughts and behaviours affecting your sleep. It's usually the first treatment recommended and can help lead to long-term improvement of your sleep. Prescription sleeping tablets are usually only considered as a last resort and should be used for only a few days or weeks at a time. This is because they don't treat the cause of your insomnia and are associated with a number of side effects. They can also become less effective over time. Read more about treating insomnia.

A child or adult with dysarthria may have: slurred, nasal-sounding or breathy speech a strained and hoarse voice excessively loud or quiet speech problems speaking in a regular rhythm, with frequent hesitations \"gurgly\"-sounding or monotone speech difficulty with tongue and lip movements difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), which may lead to constant drooling As a result of these problems, a person with dysarthria may be difficult to understand. In some cases, they may only be able to produce short phrases, single words, or no useful speech at all. Dysarthria does not affect intelligence or understanding, but a person with the condition may also have problems in these areas. Speech problems can also affect social interaction, employment and education. If you or your child has dysarthria, you may find it helpful to see a speech and language therapist. Ask your GP to refer you, or contact your nearest speech and language therapy clinic. What causes dysarthria? The muscles used for speech are controlled by the brain and nervous system. Dysarthria can develop if either of these is damaged in some way. Dysarthria can either be: developmental \u2013 when it occurs as a result of brain changes before or during birth, such as cerebral palsy acquired \u2013  when it occurs as the result of brain changes later in life, such as damage caused by a stroke, a head injury, a brain tumour, or a progressive condition such as Parkinson's disease or motor neurone disease Dysarthria in children is usually developmental while dysarthria in adults is often acquired, although both types can affect people of any age. Whether dysarthria will improve with speech and language therapy depends on what has caused the condition and the extent of the brain damage or dysfunction. Some cases may remain stable while others may worsen over time. How can a speech and language therapist help? Speech and language therapists (SLTs) play an important role in identifying and assessing children and adults with dysarthria. However, there's no guarantee that speech and language therapy can improve the speech of everyone with dysarthria.  Treatment success depends on the extent and location of the brain damage or brain dysfunction, or the stage of the progressive condition that's causing it. Diagnosing dysarthria To assess the extent of the speech problem, an SLT may ask you or your child to try any of the following tasks: make different sounds talk about a familiar topic count numbers or recite days of the week read a passage aloud The therapist may also want to examine the movement of the muscles in the mouth and voice box (larynx), and may wish to make a recording. Treating dysarthria An SLT will try to improve and maximise your ability to talk, help you find different ways of communicating, and help you and your family adapt to your new situation. They will work as part of a team of health professionals that includes people from the health, social and voluntary sector. It's difficult to generalise about what will be effective, as successful treatment is determined by an individual's underlying condition and personal circumstances. An SLT may recommend: strategies to improve speech, such as slowing speech down a programme of exercises to improve the volume or clarity of speech  assistive devices, such as a simple alphabet board, an amplifier, or a computerised voice output system Some SLTs may be able to offer a short loan of a communication aid. Read more about sources of support for carers of people with communication problems. Communication tips Tips for people with dysarthria If you have dysarthria, you may find it helpful to: take a good breath before you start speaking put extra effort into stressing key words speak slowly, saying one word at a time if necessary leave a clear space between each word make sure you are in the same room when talking and face your listener attract the listener's attention (for example, by touch or calling their name) before you begin talking to them keep sentences short and avoid long conversations if you are feeling tired reduce background noise \u2013 for example, switch off the TV or radio repeat yourself if needed Tips for family, friends and carers If you are speaking to a person with dysarthria, you may find the following advice helpful: reduce distractions and background noise when you have a conversation look at the person as they talk after speaking, allow them plenty of time to respond \u2013 if they feel rushed or pressured to speak, they may become anxious, which can affect their ability to communicate avoid finishing their sentences or correcting any errors in their language as this may cause resentment and frustration \u2013 ask what the person prefers if you do not understand what they are trying to communicate, do not pretend you understand as they may find this patronising and upsetting \u2013 it's always best to be honest about your lack of understanding if necessary, you could ask for clarification by asking yes\/no questions or paraphrasing \u2013 for example, say: \"Did you ask me if I'd done the shopping?\" Speech and language therapy Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

Children with the condition can have heart defects, learning difficulties, a cleft palate and potentially many other problems. In almost all cases, these symptoms and features result from a missing piece of chromosome \u2013 a genetic fault, or mutation, called 22q11 deletion. This genetic fault can potentially cause many different combinations of symptoms (syndromes), of which DiGeorge syndrome is just one. The 22q11 deletion is estimated to affect at least one in every 4,000 births. DiGeorge syndrome is generally considered one of the most serious types of 22q11 deletion, but each child with it is affected differently and the symptoms can vary widely. Not every child is severely affected and many will grow up to have a normal life expectancy. This page covers: What are the main features of DiGeorge syndrome?  What is 22q11 deletion? How does the mutation happen?  How is DiGeorge syndrome diagnosed?  What are the chances of my next child having it?  What help and support is available?  What is the outlook? Information about you What are the main features of DiGeorge syndrome?  DiGeorge syndrome can potentially cause many different problems affecting various areas of the body. The main features are described below, but bear in mind that the severity of these problems varies from child to child and some children with the syndrome will only experience a few of them.  Heart problems Most children with DiGeorge syndrome have heart abnormalities from birth, such as a hole in the heart or a problem with the main artery leaving the heart (the aorta). Many children will have four specific structural abnormalities of the heart, collectively known as 'tetralogy of Fallot'. These are: pulmonary stenosis \u2013 narrowing between the right heart chamber and the main blood vessel (pulmonary artery) that carries blood from the heart to the lungs  ventricular septal defect \u2013 a hole between the right and left pumping chambers (ventricles) of the heart  over-riding aorta \u2013 the entrance to the aorta is next to the ventricular septal defect, allowing low-oxygen blood to flow through it thick right ventricle \u2013 the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the narrowed pulmonary artery, causing the muscle to thicken A doctor will carry out an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to check if your child has these heart problems. Surgery may be needed to correct some of them. Read more about congenital heart disease. Learning difficulties Commonly, children with DiGeorge syndrome will have slow development of speech and poor concentration, and may struggle with maths and problem solving as they grow up. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder are fairly common, which can make learning even more difficult. The earlier any learning difficulties are noticed the better, as prompt treatment can reduce their impact and allow parents and teachers to organise any special help needed at nursery or school. Problems with the mouth, feeding and hearing Some children with DiGeorge syndrome have a cleft palate (hole in the roof of their mouth) and many more will have a problem with the surrounding mouth muscles. A few will also have a cleft lip (split in the upper lip). Read more about cleft lips and palates. These problems can result in: difficulty with speech and language and a \"nasal\" voice feeding problems \u2013 they may find it hard to chew and swallow solids (dysphagia), may occasionally regurgitate food through their nose when swallowing, and typically do not put on much weight ear infections such as glue ear, which may lead to temporary hearing loss Appearance Children with DiGeorge syndrome tend to have the following features: a long, narrow face wide-set, almond-shaped eyes  a broad nasal bridge and bulbous nose tip a small mouth small, low-set ears that are folded over at the top a cleft lip a cleft palate an irregular skull shape (craniosynostosis) Many of these features will become easier to spot as the child gets older. Infections Children with DiGeorge syndrome generally have weak immune systems because of a problem with the thymus gland \u2013 a gland in the chest that produces cells needed to fight invading germs. It means they may be susceptible to recurrent infections such as oral thrush and pneumonia. However, immune system problems often improve with age and routine childhood vaccinations should normally be given to prevent several serious infections. Hormone and growth problems Many children with DiGeorge syndrome also have an underactive parathyroid gland, known as hypoparathyroidism. There are four tiny parathyroid glands, each the size of a grain of rice, in the neck behind the thyroid gland. They produce parathyroid hormone to help control the levels of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D in the bones and blood. An underactive gland causes low levels of calcium in the blood, which can cause problems such as tremors and seizures (fits), although these are unusual after infancy. Calcium supplements may be given to treat this. Some children may also be short for their age because of a growth hormone deficiency, and they may have an underactive thyroid gland. Emotional and mental health problems Children with DiGeorge syndrome may find it difficult to make friends with children their own age and may avoid making eye contact. They may have rapid mood swings, swinging from quietness to hyperactivity, and have unexpected temper tantrums. Teenagers and adults with DiGeorge syndrome are more likely to develop depression and other psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia. Bone and muscle problems Bone and muscle problems are fairly common in people with DiGeorge syndrome. Problems that can occur include: reduced muscle tone or \"floppiness\" (hypotonia) abnormalities of the spine, such as a curved spine (scoliosis) clumsy walking or hand movements recurrent leg pains rheumatoid arthritis weak muscles, resulting in hernias and constipation (as the gut muscles don't work very well) a high shoulder blade club foot over-flexible joints (joint hypermobility) undescended testicles  Eye problems Possible eye problems include a squint (where the eyes point in different directions), a hole in the iris of the eye known as coloboma, and childhood cataracts \u2013 although these won't always need treating. Kidney problems It's quite common for a child with DiGeorge syndrome to have a missing kidney, or for one kidney to be smaller than the other. An ultrasound scan will pick this up. This shouldn't cause any problems and no treatment is necessary. What is 22q11 deletion? Chromosomes are X-shaped strands of genes, which provide instructions for a person's characteristics. Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes \u2013 one of each pair from their mother, and the other from their father. Each chromosome has a long arm (referred to as 'q') and a short arm ('p'). In 22q11 deletion, a tiny part of the long arm of chromosome 22 is missing (at position 11). 22q11 is responsible for a wide range of syndromes and conditions, ranging from mild to severe. DiGeorge syndrome is at the more severe end of the range. Scientists are not sure why the same missing piece of chromosome can result in different genetic syndromes. How does the mutation happen?  In most cases of DiGeorge syndrome, the missing piece of chromosome would already have been missing from the egg or sperm from which the baby was conceived. This can happen by chance when DNA is copied to make sperm and eggs and it can't be predicted or prevented. In these cases, there is usually no family history of the condition.  In around 10% of cases, the 22q11 deletion will have been passed on to the child by one of the parents who has the mutation themselves.   How is DiGeorge syndrome diagnosed?  The piece of missing chromosome that causes DiGeorge syndrome is so small that it cannot be seen under a microscope. Instead, a special test called the FISH test (fluorescence in situ hybridisation) will be needed to diagnose the condition. This test shows whether the region of chromosome 22 is present. If only one copy of chromosome 22 'lights up' with fluorescent DNA dye, rather than both copies, the test is positive for 22q11 deletion. The FISH test can be carried out to diagnose an unborn baby using a sample of cells from the placenta (chorionic villus sampling) or a sample of fluid surrounding the baby (amniocentesis). It can be carried out using a blood sample in children and adults. However, this test doesn't pick up every case of DiGeorge syndrome. Some people will need to have more advanced DNA tests and occasionally the diagnosis may be solely made on the characteristic features and symptoms. What are the chances of my next child having it?  A parent with DiGeorge syndrome has a 50% chance of passing on the condition to their child. This applies in each pregnancy. If neither parent has the condition, the risk of having another child with it is around 1%. If you're at risk of having a baby with DiGeorge syndrome, you should be referred for genetic counselling to discuss the level of risk and what your options are. The earliest an unborn baby can be tested in pregnancy is at 10-12 weeks, by chorionic villus sampling. Testing is also available by amniocentesis from 15-16 weeks onwards. It's important to be aware, however, that these tests cannot predict how severely a child with 22q11 deletion will be affected. Find out more about genetic testing and counselling. What help and support is available?  There's no cure for DiGeorge syndrome, but many of the problems experienced by people with the condition can be monitored and treated if necessary. Your child will have regular tests from infancy onwards, including: hearing tests and eye examinations blood tests to check hormone and calcium levels medical tests of their immune system kidney and heart scans and tests Before they start school, your child's developmental progress and speech and language development should be carefully assessed. If your child has a learning disability, their educational needs can be met either in a mainstream school with extra support, or in a special school. Read more about education for children with learning disabilities. A physiotherapist can help with any physical problems \u2013 for example, shoe inserts (orthoses) may help your child's leg pains. Read more about physiotherapy. Speech therapy can help with speech problems, and dietary changes or tube feeding may be needed temporarily to help with swallowing or feeding difficulties. Surgery may be needed to correct any severe problems, such as heart surgery or an operation to reduce the amount of air escaping through their nose (if your child's speech is very nasal). You may find it useful to discuss your concerns with a social worker, psychologist or counsellor, who you can contact directly or via your doctor. Read more about caring for a disabled child and childcare options for disabled children.  Self-help groups such as the Max Appeal may also be a good source of information and support. What is the outlook? Nowadays, most children with DiGeorge syndrome will survive into adulthood \u2013 particularly if heart problems are detected and treated early on. Less than 5% of babies die before their first birthday. As a child with DiGeorge syndrome gets older, physical features such as heart and speech problems tend to become less of an issue, but behavioural, learning and mental health problems may affect daily life. Many of those who reach adulthood will have a relatively normal life span, although for some people, ongoing health problems mean their life expectancy is lower than the average. Regular check-ups are necessary to monitor the condition. Adults with DiGeorge syndrome are often able to live independently and have jobs, although some people experience social isolation and employment problems as a result of their condition. Information about your child If your child has DiGeorge syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Related conditions As well as DiGeorge syndrome, several other conditions can be caused by 22q11 deletion. One of the main other types of 22q11 deletion is velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS). VCFS generally has many similar symptoms to DiGeorge syndrome, including problems with the structure and function of the palate (\"velo\" refers to the roof of the mouth) and heart problems from birth, but these tend to be less severe.

It can mean that you're not passing stools regularly or you're unable to completely empty your bowel. Constipation can also cause your stools to be hard and lumpy, as well as unusually large or small. The severity of constipation varies from person to person. Many people only experience constipation for a short time, but for others, constipation can be a long-term (chronic) condition that causes significant pain and discomfort and affects quality of life. Read more about the symptoms of constipation. What causes constipation? It's often difficult to identify the exact cause of constipation. However, there are a number of things that contribute to the condition, including: not eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals a change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a change in your eating habits ignoring the urge to pass stools side effects of certain medications not drinking enough fluids anxiety or depression In children, poor diet, fear about using the toilet and problems toilet training can all lead to constipation. Read more about the causes of constipation. Who's affected Constipation can occur in babies, children and adults. It's estimated that around one in every seven adults and up to one in every three children in the UK has constipation at any one time. The condition affects twice as many women as men and is also more common in older adults and during pregnancy. When to see your GP You may be able to treat constipation yourself by making simple changes to your diet and lifestyle (see below). If these changes don't help and the problem continues, you should see your GP. Also speak to your GP if you think your child might be constipated. Read more about diagnosing constipation. Treating constipation Diet and lifestyle changes are usually recommended as the first treatment for constipation. This includes gradually increasing your daily intake of fibre, making sure you drink plenty of fluids, and trying to get more exercise. If these aren't effective, your GP may prescribe an oral laxative medication that can help you empty your bowels. Treatment for constipation is effective, although in some cases it can take several months before a regular bowel pattern is re-established. Read more about treating constipation. Preventing constipation Making the diet and lifestyle changes mentioned above can also help to reduce your risk of developing constipation in the first place. Giving yourself enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably may also help, and you should try not to ignore the urge to go to the toilet. Read more about preventing constipation. Complications For most people constipation rarely causes complications, but people with long-term constipation can develop: haemorrhoids (piles) faecal impaction (where dry, hard stools collect in the rectum) bowel incontinence (the leakage of liquid stools) Read more about the complications of constipation.

It affects most people from time to time and is usually nothing to worry about. However, it can be distressing and unpleasant until it passes, which normally takes a few days to a week. What causes diarrhoea? There are many different causes of diarrhoea, but a bowel infection (gastroenteritis) is a common cause in both adults and children. Gastroenteritis can be caused by: a virus \u2013 such as norovirus or rotavirus bacteria \u2013 such as campylobacter and Escherichia coli (E. coli), which are often picked up from contaminated food  a parasite \u2013 such as the parasite that causes giardiasis, which is spread in contaminated water These infections can sometimes be caught during travel abroad, particularly to areas with poor standards of public hygiene. This is known as travellers' diarrhoea. Diarrhoea can also be the result of anxiety, a food allergy, medication, or a long-term condition, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Read more about the causes of diarrhoea. What to do if you have diarrhoea Most cases of diarrhoea clear up after a few days without treatment, and you may not need to see your GP. However, diarrhoea can lead to dehydration, so you should drink plenty of fluids \u2013 small, frequent sips of water \u2013 until it passes. It's very important that babies and small children do not become dehydrated. Your pharmacist may suggest you use an oral rehydration solution (ORS) if you or your child are particularly at risk of dehydration. You should eat solid food as soon as you feel able to. If you're breastfeeding or bottle feeding your baby and they have diarrhoea, you should try to feed them as normal. Stay at home until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea to prevent spreading any infection to others. Medications to reduce diarrhoea, such as loperamide, are available. However, these are not usually necessary, and most types should not be given to children. Read more about treating diarrhoea. When to see your GP Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if you're concerned about yourself or your child. It's important to see your GP if the diarrhoea is particularly frequent or severe, or associated with other symptoms, such as: blood in your or your child's poo persistent vomiting a severe or continuous stomach ache weight loss signs of dehydration \u2013 including drowsiness, passing urine infrequently, and feeling lightheaded or dizzy your poo is dark or black \u2013 this may be a sign of bleeding inside your stomach You should also contact your GP if your or your child's diarrhoea is particularly persistent, as this may be a sign of a more serious problem. In most cases, diarrhoea should pass within about a week. Read more about when to contact your GP and diagnosing diarrhoea. Preventing diarrhoea Diarrhoea is often caused by an infection. You can reduce your risk by making sure you maintain high standards of hygiene. For example, you should: wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after going to the toilet and before eating or preparing food clean the toilet, including the handle and the seat, with disinfectant after each bout of diarrhoea avoid sharing towels, flannels, cutlery, or utensils with other household members It's also important to practise good food and water hygiene while travelling abroad, such as avoiding potentially unsafe tap water and undercooked food.

It's more commonly known as \"passing wind\", or \"farting\". Farting is often laughed about, but excessive flatulence can be embarrassing and make you feel uncomfortable around others. However, it can usually be controlled with changes to your diet and lifestyle. Flatulence is a normal biological process and is something everyone experiences regularly. Some people pass wind only a few times a day, others a lot more, but the average is said to be about 5 to 15 times a day. Why it happens When you swallow food, water or saliva, you also swallow small amounts of air, which collects in the digestive system. Gases can also build up when you digest food. The body needs to get rid of the build-up by farting (flatulence) or burping (belching). Sometimes you may not notice you have passed wind because most of the gases are odourless and often released in small quantities. Flatulence usually only has a bad smell if it contains gases that smell, such as sulphur. However, it's important to remember it's normal for the gas you pass to sometimes smell a bit. Excessive flatulence can be caused by swallowing more air than usual or eating food that's difficult to digest. It can also be related to an underlying health problem affecting the digestive system, such as recurring indigestion or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Read more about the causes of flatulence. When to see your GP There are no medical guidelines defining the normal frequency or volume of flatulence. You're probably the best person to assess your own symptoms. See your GP if your flatulence is particularly troublesome \u2013 for example, if you're frequently passing smelly gas. You should also visit your GP if you experience additional symptoms, such as: persistent abdominal pain and bloating recurring episodes of diarrhoea or constipation unexplained weight loss bowel incontinence  blood in your stools (faeces) signs of an infection, such as a high temperature, vomiting, chills, joint pain and muscle pain These symptoms could be an indicator of a more serious health problem and may require investigation, such as a blood or stool test to look for an infection. Controlling the problem Excessive flatulence can usually be controlled by making changes to your diet and lifestyle, such as: avoiding foods known to cause flatulence eating smaller and more frequent meals eating and drinking slowly exercising regularly There are also some over-the-counter medications that can help if your flatulence is troublesome, such as charcoal tablets or simethicone. If your flatulence is related to an underlying health problem, treating the condition may help resolve it. Read more about treating flatulence.

It usually occurs as a result of the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus becoming weakened. Read more about the causes of GORD. GORD causes symptoms such as heartburn and an unpleasant taste in the back of the mouth. It may just be an occasional nuisance for some people, but for others it can be a severe, lifelong problem. GORD can often be controlled with self-help measures and medication. Occasionally, surgery to correct the problem may be needed. This topic focuses on GORD in adults. There are separate topics on reflux in babies and heartburn in pregnancy.

Dyspepsia and heartburn may occur together or on their own. Symptoms usually appear soon after eating or drinking. Common associated symptoms include: feeling full or bloated feeling sick (nausea) belching bringing up (regurgitating) fluid or food into the gullet (oesophagus) Indigestion is a common problem that affects many people, but in most cases it's mild and only occurs occasionally. Read more about the symptoms of indigestion. Why it happens Indigestion may be caused by stomach acid coming into contact with the sensitive, protective lining of the digestive system (mucosa). The stomach acid breaks down the lining, leading to irritation and inflammation, which can be painful. The majority of people with indigestion don't have inflammation in their digestive system. Therefore, their symptoms are thought to be caused by increased sensitivity of the mucosa (to acidity or stretching). In most cases indigestion is related to eating, although it can be triggered by other factors such as smoking, drinking, alcohol, pregnancy, stress or taking certain medications. Read more about the causes of indigestion. Treating indigestion at home Most people are able to treat indigestion with simple changes to their diet and lifestyle, or with a number of different medications, such as antacids. Read more about the treatment of indigestion. Read how to ease indigestion in pregnancy. Very rarely, a serious underlying health condition is the cause of indigestion. If this is suspected, then further investigation such as an endoscopy will be required (see below). When to see your doctor Most people will not need to seek medical advice for their indigestion. However, it is important to see your GP if you have recurring indigestion and any of the following apply: you are 55 years old or over you have lost a lot of weight without meaning to you have increasing difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) you have persistent vomiting you have iron deficiency anaemia you have a lump in your stomach you have blood in your vomit or blood in your stools This is because these symptoms may be a sign of an underlying health condition, such as a stomach ulcer or stomach cancer. You may need to be referred for an endoscopy to rule out any serious cause. An endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of the body is examined using an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube that has a light and camera on one end). Severe indigestion can cause long-term problems with parts of your digestive tract, such as scarring of the oesophagus or the passage from your stomach.

It can cause bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and\/or constipation. The symptoms vary between individuals and affect some people more severely than others. They tend to come and go in periods lasting a few days to a few months at a time, often during times of stress or after eating certain foods. You may find some of the symptoms of IBS ease after going to the toilet and opening your bowels. IBS is thought to affect up to one in five people at some point in their life, and it usually first develops when a person is between 20 and 30 years of age. Around twice as many women are affected as men. The condition is often lifelong, although it may improve over several years. Read more about the symptoms of IBS. When to see your GP See your GP if you think you have IBS symptoms, so they can try to determine the cause. Your GP may be able to identify IBS based on your symptoms, although blood tests may be needed to rule out other conditions. Read more about diagnosing IBS. What causes IBS? The exact cause of IBS is unknown, but most experts think that it's related to increased sensitivity of the gut and problems digesting food. These problems may mean that you are more sensitive to pain coming from your gut, and you may become constipated or have diarrhoea because your food passes through your gut either too slowly or too quickly. Psychological factors such as stress may also play a part in IBS. Read more about the causes of IBS. How IBS is treated There is no cure for IBS, but the symptoms can often be managed by making changes to your diet and lifestyle. For example, it may help to: identify and avoid foods or drinks that trigger your symptoms alter the amount of fibre in your diet exercise regularly reduce your stress levels Medication is sometimes prescribed for people with IBS to treat the individual symptoms they experience. Read more about treating IBS. Living with IBS IBS is unpredictable. You may go for many months without any symptoms, then have a sudden flare-up. The condition can also be painful and debilitating, which can have a negative impact on your quality of life and emotional state. Many people with IBS will experience feelings of depression and anxiety, at some point.  Speak to your GP if you have feelings of depression or anxiety that are affecting your daily life. These problems rarely improve without treatment and your GP can recommend treatments such as antidepressants or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which can help you cope with IBS, as well as directly treating the condition. With appropriate medical and psychological treatment, you should be able to live a normal, full and active life with IBS.  IBS does not pose a serious threat to your physical health and does not increase your chances of developing cancer or other bowel-related conditions.

In general, bright-red blood means the bleeding has come from somewhere near your anus and is a typical sign of piles (haemorrhoids) or a small tear (anal fissure) in the skin of your anus. Although these are common problems, don't let embarrassment stop you seeing your GP. You should always get rectal bleeding checked to rule out more serious causes. Around 10% of adults experience rectal bleeding every year in the UK. If the blood is darker in colour and sticky, the bleeding may have occurred higher up your digestive system. This type of bleeding can turn your faeces black or plum-coloured (known as melaena). Having plum-coloured, dark and sticky faeces may be a medical emergency \u2013 you should see your GP immediately or contact NHS 111. How your GP investigates rectal bleeding If your GP needs to examine you to find out what's causing your rectal bleeding, they may carry out a rectal examination. This involves putting a gloved finger inside your bottom (rectum). There's no need to feel embarrassed or nervous: it's a quick and painless procedure that GPs are used to doing. The examination usually takes one to five minutes, depending on whether your GP finds anything unusual. You may be referred to a hospital or specialist clinic if further examinations and tests are needed. Is it bowel cancer? Many people with rectal bleeding worry they may have bowel cancer. While rectal bleeding can be a sign of early-stage bowel cancer, other factors may also be present for your doctor to think you're at risk. You should be urgently referred to a specialist with suspected bowel cancer if you have rectal bleeding and: you're aged 40 or older and have passed looser or more frequent stools for the last six weeks you're aged 60 or older and the bleeding has lasted for six weeks or more your GP has found an abnormality (such as a lump) after examining you  you also have anaemia (a reduced number of red blood cells) you have a family history of bowel cancer you have ulcerative colitis Bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer, depending on where the cancer starts. Find out more about bowel cancer, and read the NICE guidelines for being referred with suspected cancer. Common causes of rectal bleeding Some of the most common causes of visible rectal bleeding in adults are outlined below. However, don't try to diagnose yourself, and always see your GP for a proper diagnosis. Click on the links for more information about these causes. piles (haemorrhoids) \u2013 swollen blood vessels in and around the rectum. They can bleed when you have a bowel movement, which can leave streaks of bright-red blood in your stools and on the toilet paper. Piles may also cause itchiness around your anus. They often heal on their own. anal fissure \u2013 a small tear in the skin of the anus, which can be painful as the skin is very sensitive. The blood is usually bright red and the bleeding soon stops. You may feel like you need to keep passing stools, even when your bowel is empty. It often heals on its own within a few weeks. anal fistula \u2013 a small channel that develops between the end of the bowel, known as the anal canal or back passage, and the skin near the anus (the opening where waste leaves the body). They're usually painful and can cause bleeding when you go to the toilet. angiodysplasia \u2013 abnormal blood vessels in the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause bleeding. It's more common in older people and can cause painless rectal bleeding. gastroenteritis \u2013 a viral or bacterial infection of the stomach and bowel, which your immune system usually fights off after a few days. It can cause diarrhoea containing traces of blood and mucus, as well as vomiting and stomach cramps. diverticula \u2013 small bulges in the lining of your lower bowel. These contain weakened blood vessels that can burst and cause sudden, painless bleeding (you may pass quite a lot of blood in your stools). bowel cancer (colon or rectal cancer) \u2013 you should always get checked by your GP if you have rectal bleeding. The only symptom of bowel cancer may be rectal bleeding in the early stages, so don't ignore it. Bowel cancer can be treated more easily if it's diagnosed at an early stage. Less common causes of rectal bleeding Some of the more unusual causes of rectal bleeding include: anticoagulant drugs \u2013 such as warfarin or aspirin, which are taken to reduce your chance of a blood clot but can sometimes cause internal bleeding. inflammatory bowel disease \u2013 such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. These long-term conditions cause the lining of the bowel to become inflamed. Crohn's disease affects the gut higher up, whereas ulcerative colitis affects the large bowel and rectum further down. Both tend to cause bloody diarrhoea. bowel polyps \u2013 small growths on the inner lining of the colon or rectum. These are common and often don't cause symptoms, but may lead to a small amount of blood in your stool. sexually transmitted infections (STIs) \u2013 any sexual activity involving the anal area can spread STIs, which may sometimes lead to rectal bleeding. Read more about the risks of anal sex.

It's usually short-lived and is often not serious. Severe abdominal pain is a greater cause for concern. If it starts suddenly and unexpectedly, it should be regarded as a medical emergency, especially if the pain is concentrated in a particular area. Call your GP as soon as possible or go to your nearest hospital accident and emergency (A&E) department if this is the case. If you feel pain in the area around your ribs, read about chest pain for information and advice. Stomach cramps with bloating Stomach cramps with bloating are often caused by trapped wind. This is a very common problem that can be embarrassing, but is easily dealt with. Your chemist will be able to recommend a product such as buscopan or mebeverine, which can be bought over the counter to treat the problem. Sudden stomach cramps with diarrhoea If your stomach cramps have started recently and you also have diarrhoea, the cause may be a tummy bug (gastroenteritis). This means you have a viral or bacterial infection of the stomach and bowel, which should get better without treatment after a few days. Gastroenteritis may be caused by coming into close contact with someone who's infected, or by eating contaminated food (food poisoning). If you have repeated bouts of stomach cramps and diarrhoea, you may have a long-term condition, such as irritable bowel syndrome. Sudden severe abdominal pain If you have sudden agonising pain in a particular area of your tummy, call your GP immediately or go to your nearest A&E department. It may be a sign of a serious problem that could rapidly get worse without treatment. Serious causes of sudden severe abdominal pain include: appendicitis \u2013 the swelling of the appendix (a finger-like pouch connected to the large intestine), which causes agonising pain in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen, and means your appendix will need to be removed a bleeding or perforated stomach ulcer \u2013 a bleeding, open sore in the lining of your stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) acute cholecystitis \u2013 inflammation of the gallbladder, which is often caused by gallstones; in many cases, your gallbladder will need to be removed kidney stones \u2013 small stones may be passed out in your urine, but larger stones may block the kidney tubes, and you'll need to go to hospital to have them broken up diverticulitis \u2013 inflammation of the small pouches in the bowel that sometimes requires treatment with antibiotics in hospital If your GP suspects you have one of these conditions, they may refer you to hospital immediately. Sudden and severe pain in your abdomen can also sometimes be caused by an infection of the stomach and bowel (gastroenteritis). It may also be caused by a pulled muscle in your abdomen or by an injury. Long-term or recurring abdominal pain See your GP if you or your child have persistent or repeated abdominal pain. The cause is often not serious and can be managed. Possible causes in adults include: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \u2013 a common condition that causes bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea or constipation; the pain is often relieved when you go to the toilet inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) \u2013 long-term conditions that involve inflammation of the gut, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis a urinary tract infection that keeps returning \u2013 in these cases, you will usually also experience a burning sensation when you urinate constipation  period pain \u2013 painful muscle cramps in women that are linked to the menstrual cycle other stomach-related problems \u2013 such as a stomach ulcer, heartburn and acid reflux, or gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining) Possible causes in children include: constipation a urinary tract infection that keeps returning heartburn and acid reflux  abdominal migraines \u2013 recurrent episodes of abdominal pain with no identifiable cause Page last reviewed: 15\/12\/2014 Next review due: 15\/12\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's sometimes known as a digital rectal examination (DRE). Some people find having a rectal examination embarrassing, but it only takes a few minutes and isn't usually painful.  Read more about how a rectal examination is performed. What it's used for One of the most common reasons for having a rectal examination is if a man has a suspected problem with his prostate gland (see below), which could be a sign of prostate disease or prostate cancer.  A rectal examination may also be needed if a person develops changes in their normal bowel habits, which could indicate a problem with their digestive system. These changes could include: bleeding from your rectum  constipation loss of normal bowel function, also called bowel incontinence (and occasionally urinary incontinence) pain in your bottom (proctalgia)  The prostate gland    The prostate gland is a small gland found only in men. It's located in the pelvis, between the penis and bladder, and surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis). The prostate gland can be examined by placing a finger into the rectum. The doctor carrying out the examination will be able to feel any changes in the prostate, such as swelling and hardening. The prostate gland often becomes larger in older men. This can place pressure on the bladder and urethra, causing symptoms such as: difficulty beginning to urinate a flow of urine that's weak or stops and starts having to push or strain to pass urine a frequent need to urinate waking up frequently during the night to urinate Prostate enlargement can be troublesome to live with, but it doesn't pose a threat to health. However, its symptoms are similar to the symptoms of prostate cancer, and a rectal examination is one way of finding out whether the symptoms are caused by prostate enlargement or prostate cancer. Prostate cancer can cause the surface of the prostate gland to become hard and bumpy, while prostate enlargement doesn't usually affect the surface. A rectal examination isn't a guaranteed way of diagnosing prostate cancer, so it's usually used in combination with other tests, such as a blood test and a biopsy (where a small sample of the prostate gland is removed for further testing). Prostate enlargement animation Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video. Prostate enlargement or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition in older men. This animation explains what the prostate gland is and how it functions. It also highlights the importance of seeing your GP to check for prostate cancer.

It's carried out using a hysteroscope, which is a narrow telescope with a light and camera at the end. Images are sent to a monitor so your doctor or specialist nurse can see inside your womb. The hysteroscope is passed into your womb through your vagina and cervix (entrance to the womb), which means no cuts need to be made in your skin. When a hysteroscopy may be carried out A hysteroscopy can be used to: investigate symptoms or problems \u2013 such as heavy periods, unusual vaginal bleeding, postmenopausal bleeding, pelvic pain, repeated miscarriages or difficulty getting pregnant diagnose conditions \u2013 such as fibroids and polyps (non-cancerous growths in the womb) treat conditions and problems \u2013 such as removing fibroids, polyps, displaced intrauterine devices (IUDs) and intrauterine adhesions (scar tissue that causes absent periods and reduced fertility) A procedure called dilatation and curettage (D&C) used to be commonly used to examine the womb and remove abnormal growths, but nowadays hysteroscopies are carried out instead. What happens during a hysteroscopy A hysteroscopy is usually carried out on an outpatient or day-case basis. This means you don't have to stay in hospital overnight. It may not be necessary to use anaesthetic for the procedure, although local anaesthetic (where medication is used to numb your cervix) is sometimes used. General anaesthetic may be used if you\u2019re having treatment during the procedure or you would prefer to be asleep while it\u2019s carried out. During a hysteroscopy: you lie on a couch with your legs held in supports and a sheet is used to cover your lower half an instrument called a speculum may be inserted into your vagina to hold it open (the same instrument used for a cervical screening test), although this isn't always necessary the hysteroscope is passed into your womb and fluid is gently pumped inside to make it easier for your doctor to see the camera sends pictures to a monitor so your doctor can spot and\/or treat any abnormalities A hysteroscopy can take up to 30 minutes in total, although it may only last around 5-10 minutes if it's just being done to diagnose a condition or investigate symptoms. You may experience some discomfort similar to period cramps while it's carried out, but it shouldn't be painful. Read more about what happens during a hysteroscopy.  Recovering from a hysteroscopy Most women feel able to return to their normal activities the following day, although some women return to work the same day. You may wish to have a few days off to rest if general anaesthetic was used. While you're recovering: you can eat and drink as normal straight away you may experience cramping that's similar to period pain and some spotting or bleeding for a few days \u2013 this is normal and nothing to worry about unless it's heavy you should avoid having sex for a week, or until any bleeding has stopped, to reduce the risk of infection (see below) Your doctor or nurse will discuss the findings of the procedure with you before you leave hospital. Read more about what happens after a hysteroscopy. Risks of a hysteroscopy A hysteroscopy is generally very safe, but like any procedure there is a small risk of complications. The risk is higher for women who have treatment during a hysteroscopy.  Some of the main risks associated with a hysteroscopy are: accidental damage to the womb \u2013 this is uncommon, but may require treatment with antibiotics in hospital or, in rare cases, another operation to repair it accidental damage to the cervix \u2013 this is rare and can usually be easily repaired excessive bleeding during or after surgery \u2013 this can occur if you had treatment under general anaesthetic and can be treated with medication or another procedure; very rarely it may be necessary to remove the womb (hysterectomy) infection of the womb \u2013 this can cause smelly vaginal discharge, a fever and heavy bleeding; it can usually be treated with a short course of antibiotics from your GP feeling faint \u2013 this affects 1 in every 200 women who have a hysteroscopy carried out without an anaesthetic or just a local anaesthetic A hysteroscopy will only be carried out if the benefits are thought to outweigh the risks. Alternatives to hysteroscopy Your womb could also be examined by using a: pelvic ultrasound \u2013 where a small probe is inserted in the vagina and uses sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your womb endometrial biopsy \u2013 when a narrow tube is passed through your cervix into your womb, with suction used to remove a sample of your womb's lining These alternatives may be performed alongside a hysteroscopy, but do not provide as much information and can't be used to treat problems in the same way as a hysteroscopy.

This affects the heart's ability to pump blood around the body. Some types of cardiomyopathy are inherited and are seen in children and younger people. This page explains the main types of cardiomyopathy: dilated cardiomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy takotsubo cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome' It then explains:  diagnosing cardiomyopathy treating cardiomyopathy information about you Dilated cardiomyopathy In dilated cardiomyopathy the muscle walls of the heart have become stretched and thin, so they can't contract (squeeze) properly to pump blood around the body. How serious is it? If you have dilated cardiomyopathy, you're at greater risk of heart failure, where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure. Heart failure typically causes shortness of breath, extreme tiredness and ankle swelling. Learn more about the symptoms of heart failure. There's also a risk of heart valve problems, an irregular heartbeat and blood clots. You'll need to have regular appointments with your GP so the disease can be monitored. Who's affected? Dilated cardiomyopathy can affect both children and adults.  The heart muscle can become stretched if you have an unhealthy lifestyle or an underlying medical condition, or both. The following can all play a role in the disease: uncontrolled high blood pressure an unhealthy lifestyle \u2013 such as a lack of vitamins and minerals in the diet, heavy drinking and recreational drug use a viral infection that causes inflammation of the heart muscle   a heart valve problem a disease of the body tissues or vessels \u2013 such as Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, lupus, polyarteritis nodosa, vasculitis or muscular dystrophy inheriting a mutated (changed) gene that makes you more vulnerable to the disease pregnancy \u2013 cardiomyopathy can sometimes develop as a complication of pregnancy But for many people, the cause is unknown. More information Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on living with dilated cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle cells have enlarged and the walls of the heart chambers thicken. The chambers are reduced in size so they can't hold much blood, and the walls can't relax properly and may stiffen. How serious is it? Most people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will be able to live a full, normal life. Some people don't even have symptoms and don't need treatment. But that doesn't mean the condition can't be serious. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden unexpected death in childhood and in young athletes. The main heart chambers can become stiff, leading to back pressure on the smaller collecting chambers. This can sometimes worsen the symptoms of heart failure and lead to abnormal heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation). Blood flow from the heart may become reduced or restricted (known as obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Also, the mitral heart valve can become leaky, causing blood to leak backwards. Read more about mitral regurgitation. These heart changes can cause dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath and temporary loss of consciousness. You'll also be at greater risk of developing endocarditis (a heart infection). If you have severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, you'll need to see your doctor regularly so your condition can be monitored. Your doctor will advise about the level and amount of exercise you can do and sensible lifestyle changes to make.  Who's affected? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is thought to affect 1 in 500 people in the UK. Most people inherit the disease from their parents. Read more about how genetic conditions are inherited.   More information Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on living with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy is rare and mostly affects older adults. The walls of the main heart chambers become stiffened and rigid and can't relax properly after contracting. This means the heart can't fill up properly with blood. It results in reduced blood flow from the heart and can lead to symptoms of heart failure, such as breathlessness, tiredness and ankle swelling, as well as heart rhythm problems. In many cases the cause is unknown, although sometimes it can be inherited. More information Read the American Heart Association's leaflet on restrictive cardiomyopathy (PDF, 102kb). Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy In arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), the proteins that normally hold the heart muscle cells together are abnormal. Muscle cells can die and the dead muscle tissue is replaced with fatty and fibrous tissue. The walls of the main heart chambers become thin and stretched, and can't pump blood around the body properly. People with ARVC typically have heart rhythm problems. Reduced blood flow from the heart can also lead to symptoms of heart failure. ARVC is an uncommon inherited condition caused by a mutation (change) in one or more genes. It can affect teenagers or young adults and has been the reason for some sudden unexplained deaths in young athletes. There's increasing evidence that prolonged, strenuous exercise worsens the symptoms of ARVC. It's important that people with or at risk of ARVC have a careful discussion about this with their cardiologist. More information Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on ARVC. Diagnosing cardiomyopathy Some cases of cardiomyopathy can be diagnosed after various heart scans and tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an echocardiogram. Cardiomyopathy that runs in the family can be diagnosed after a genetic test. If you've been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, you may be advised to have a genetic test to identify the mutation (faulty gene) that caused this. Your relatives can then be tested for the same mutation and, if they have it, their condition can be monitored and managed early. Treating cardiomyopathy  There's no cure for cardiomyopathy, but the treatments described below are usually effective at controlling symptoms and preventing complications. Not everyone with cardiomyopathy will need treatment. Some people only have a mild form of the disease that they can control after making a few lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes If the cause of your cardiomyopathy isn't genetic, it should generally help to: follow a healthy diet and take gentle exercise quit smoking (if you smoke) lose weight (if you're overweight) avoid or reduce your intake of alcohol  get plenty of sleep manage stress make sure any underlying condition, such as diabetes, is well controlled  Medication Medication may be needed to control blood pressure, correct an abnormal heart rhythm, remove excess fluid or prevent blood clots.  Read about: medication for high blood pressure beta-blockers to treat an irregular heartbeat or heart failure diuretics to remove excess fluid from your body if this has caused swelling anticoagulants such as warfarin to prevent blood clots medication to treat heart failure Hospital procedures In some people with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the septum (the wall dividing the left and right side of the heart) is thickened and bulges into the main heart chamber. They may need to have either: an injection of alcohol into their heart \u2013 this is to reduce part of the muscle in the septum a septal myectomy \u2013 heart surgery to remove part of the thickened septum (the mitral valve may be repaired at the same time, if necessary) Those with heart rhythm problems may need to have a pacemaker, or a similar device, implanted to control their abnormal heart rhythm. Read more about having a pacemaker fitted. As a last resort, a heart transplant may be necessary. Information about you If you have cardiomyopathy, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. GOV.UK has more information about the register. Broken heart syndrome Some people who sustain significant emotional or physical stress, such as bereavement or major surgery, go on to experience a temporary heart problem. The heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or \"stunned\", causing the left ventricle (one of the heart's main chambers) to change shape. It may be caused by a surge of hormones, particularly adrenaline, during this period of stress. The main symptoms are chest pain and breathlessness, similar to those of a heart attack \u2013 always call 999 if you or someone else experiences these. The condition \u2013 known medically as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or acute stress cardiomyopathy \u2013 is temporary and reversible. It's unusual for it to happen again.

Diphtheria is highly contagious. It\u2019s spread by coughs and sneezes, or by contact with someone with diphtheria or items belonging to them, such as bedding or clothing. The infection is usually caught after being in close or prolonged contact with someone who has the condition or is carrying the infection. For example, you may catch diphtheria from someone you live with. However, diphtheria is very rare in England because most people have been vaccinated against it. It tends to be a problem in parts of the world where fewer people are vaccinated, such as Africa, South Asia and the former Soviet Union. What are the symptoms? The symptoms of diphtheria include: a thick grey-white coating at the back of the throat a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above sore throat breathing difficulties Older people and people with a weakened immune system are more at risk of the effects of diphtheria. The most serious cases can be fatal. An estimated 5-10% of people who get the infection will die from complications of diphtheria, such as breathing difficulties, inflammation of the heart (myocarditis) or problems with the nervous system. Diagnosing diphtheria A diagnosis of diphtheria can be confirmed by taking a sample of cells from the throat, nose or wound on the skin. This will be examined to see whether the bacteria that cause diphtheria are present. Treating diphtheria Diphtheria must be treated quickly to prevent serious complications developing. If diphtheria is suspected, treatment will begin before any test results are confirmed. Treatment for diphtheria comprises antibiotics and antitoxin medicine. Anyone suspected of having the condition will be put in isolation when they\u2019re admitted to hospital. Those who develop heart and nervous system complications will need specialist treatment, and may need to be admitted to the intensive care ward. Vaccination All children should be vaccinated against diphtheria as part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule. Adults should consider having a booster vaccine when travelling to parts of the world where diphtheria is widespread. Read more information about the diphtheria vaccination and travel vaccinations. How common is diphtheria? Before a vaccination programme was introduced in 1940, diphtheria was a very common condition and one of the leading causes of death in children. The vaccination programme has been very successful. Since 2010, there have been only 20 recorded cases of diphtheria in England and Wales, and one death. Diphtheria is a notifiable disease, which means that if a doctor diagnoses the condition, they must tell the local authority. Even though the numbers of diphtheria cases in England is low, there's a risk that an outbreak could occur if the number of people who are vaccinated falls below a certain level. This risk was demonstrated by the diphtheria epidemic that struck the countries of the former Soviet Union between 1990 and 1998. It resulted in 157,000 cases and 5,000 deaths. The epidemic was caused by an increase in the number of children who were not vaccinated against the disease. All children should be vaccinated against diphtheria at two months of age as part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule.  All children should be vaccinated against diphtheria at two months of age as part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule  Page last reviewed: 16\/02\/2015 Next review due: 16\/02\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

They don't always cause symptoms and when they do they are often mistaken for another illness. Tapeworm infections are most commonly seen in developing countries and are rare in the UK. Tapeworms are known medically as cestodes. They are usually flat and ribbon-like and made up of segments. Some adult worms grow to 4.5-9m (15-30 feet) in length. Humans can catch them by: touching contaminated faeces (stools) and then placing their hands near their mouth swallowing food or water containing traces of contaminated faeces eating raw contaminated pork, beef or fish Read more about the causes of a tapeworm infection. How do I know if I have a tapeworm? You may not know you have a tapeworm infection until you see segments of the worm in your stools (poo). The segments will look like white grains of rice but sometimes longer sections of the worm may need to be seen by an expert to confirm diagnosis. A tapeworm infection does not always cause symptoms. Or if there are symptoms \u2013 typically stomach pain and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea \u2013 they are often mistaken for another illness. Read more information about the symptoms of a tapeworm infection. See your GP if you see what you think are segments of a tapeworm in your stools. Infection is usually diagnosed from a stool sample but further tests may be needed depending on the type of tapeworm infection. Read more about how tapeworm infections are diagnosed. Treating tapeworm infections If you're diagnosed with a tapeworm infection you'll need treatment to get rid of it. The beef tapeworm lives only in your intestine and is easily treated with tablets. But other tapeworms can lead to serious complications and those that develop as larvae in your body are more difficult to treat. Read more information about treating tapeworm infections and complications of a tapeworm infection. Avoiding tapeworm infections It is important to prepare food properly to avoid a tapeworm infection. Raw meat and fish in particular must be cooked and stored correctly. Vegetables and fruit should be washed thoroughly before they are eaten. Your personal hygiene is even more important if you are in close contact with animals, or travelling in a country where tapeworm infections are more common.

The two images may be one on top of the other, side by side, or a mix of both. Double vision may be constant, it may come and go, or it may only occur when you're looking in a particular direction. The cause of your double vision depends on whether your double vision is coming from one eye (monocular) or both eyes (binocular). This also affects which treatment you receive. Treatment ranges from special glasses and eye exercises, to surgery to remove a cataract. Read more about treating double vision. Recognising double vision in children Adults are able to describe what is happening with their sight, but young children may not be able to explain what is wrong clearly. If your child has double vision, they may narrow or squint their eyes closed in an effort to see better, or they may frequently cover one eye with their hand. They may also turn their head in unusual ways (for example, tilting their head) or look sideways instead of facing forward to try to avoid double vision. When to see your GP Visit your GP as soon as possible if you develop double vision or you suspect your child has double vision or a squint. If you've never had double vision before, it's important to have it checked as it could be a symptom of a serious medical condition. Your GP will probably refer you to an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) at your local hospital, or an orthoptist (eye movement specialist). Tests for double vision in hospital Your eyecare team will usually start by assessing your vision. They may ask you to read letters off a chart, measure any current glasses, look at the position of your eyes, and assess how well you can move them. They may also assess how well your eyes are working together (your binocular vision). Your ophthalmologist will also use a microscope with a very bright light called a slit lamp to examine the front and back of your eyes. These results, together with your medical history and any other symptoms you have, should determine what could be causing your double vision. Further tests Further tests depend on whether the double vision is monocular or binocular, but may include taking images of your eye. A picture of your brain or eye muscles may also be taken using: a computerised tomography (CT) scan, which takes a series of X-rays at slightly different angles and uses a computer to put the images together a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images Blood tests may also be used to check for an underlying condition. What causes binocular double vision? Each eye creates its own slightly different image because the two eyes are physically located in different positions. However, you usually only see one image. This is because your brain joins the images produced by each eye together into a single image in a process known as fusion. If your eye muscles or nerves are damaged, the muscles may not be able to control your eyes properly and you may develop double vision. Your eye muscles can also be weakened as a result of a health condition, or your eyes may not be aligned properly. This is sometimes known as a squint. Adults who had a squint as a child may sometimes develop double vision over time. Read more about the causes of double vision. What causes monocular double vision? Double vision in one eye is known as monocular double vision. You should be able to see normally if the affected eye is covered, but double vision continues when the unaffected eye is covered. In cases of monocular double vision, the two images are often only slightly separated. This is sometimes referred to as \"ghosting\". Causes of monocular double vision can include: refractive errors \u2013 such as short-sightedness or long-sightedness corneal disease cataracts retinal abnormalities Double vision in both eyes Double vision in both eyes is known as binocular double vision. It happens when both eyes fail to work together properly. If you have binocular double vision, your vision will usually return to normal if either eye is covered. Physiological double vision You may experience physiological double vision when objects in your background field of vision, which you're not specifically focusing on, appear double. Your brain usually compensates for this type of double vision, and it often goes unnoticed. However, children who complain of having double vision sometimes have physiological double vision. Driving If you have just developed double vision, or you have other eye-related conditions, your driving ability is likely to be affected. Check with your GP or ophthalmologist (eye care specialist) if you have an eye condition and you're unsure whether it affects your ability to drive safely. If problems with your vision affect your ability to drive and you hold a current driving licence, it's your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). Visit the GOV.UK website to find out how to tell the DVLA about a medical condition.

It's also known as discoid dermatitis. The patches can be a few millimetres to a few centimetres in size and can affect any part of the body, although they don't usually affect the face or scalp. The patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid at first, but become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky over time. The patches may clear up on their own eventually, but this can take weeks, months or even years if not treated, and they can recur. Read more about the symptoms of discoid eczema. Seeking medical advice You should see your pharmacist or GP if you think you may have discoid eczema. Your GP should be able to make a diagnosis just by examining the affected areas of skin. In some cases they may also ask questions or arrange some tests to rule out other conditions. Your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (a doctor who specialises in managing skin conditions) if they are unsure of the diagnosis or if you need patch testing. Your GP or specialist can recommend suitable treatments. What causes discoid eczema? The cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it is often accompanied by dry skin and is thought to be triggered by irritation of the skin. Discoid eczema tends to affect adults and is rare in children. It is more common among men aged from 50 to 70 and women in their teens or twenties. Some people with discoid eczema may also have other types of eczema, such as atopic eczema. Read more about the causes of discoid eczema. How discoid eczema is treated Discoid eczema is usually a long-term problem, but medications are available to help relieve the symptoms and keep the condition under control. Treatments used include: emollients \u2013 moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry topical corticosteroids \u2013 ointments and creams applied to the skin that can help relieve severe symptoms antihistamines \u2013 medications that can reduce itching and help you sleep better There are also things you can do yourself to help, such as avoiding all the irritating chemicals in soaps, detergents, bubble baths and shower gels.

It's often caused by a blow or a sudden change in direction when the leg is planted on the ground, such as during sports or dancing. The kneecap (patella) normally sits over the front of the knee. It glides over a groove in the joint when you bend or straighten your leg. When the kneecap dislocates, it comes out of this groove and the supporting tissues can be stretched or torn. This page covers: Symptoms What to do Treatment Recovery Repeated dislocations Symptoms of a dislocated kneecap When a kneecap dislocates, it will usually look out of place or at an odd angle. But in many cases it will pop back into place soon afterwards. Other symptoms can include: a \"popping\" sensation severe knee pain being unable to straighten the knee sudden swelling of the knee being unable to walk What to do if you dislocate your kneecap A dislocated kneecap isn't usually serious and will often pop back into place by itself. But it's still a good idea to get it checked by a health professional: if your kneecap has gone back into place by itself \u2013 go to your nearest minor injuries unit (MIU) or accident and emergency (A&E) department if your kneecap hasn't gone back into place \u2013 call an ambulance: don't try to put it back in place yourself While you're on your way to hospital or waiting for an ambulance, sit still with your leg in the most comfortable position. Treatment for a dislocated kneecap If your kneecap hasn't corrected itself by the time you get to hospital, a doctor will manipulate it back into place. This is known as a reduction. You may be given medication to ensure you're relaxed and free from pain while this is done. Once the kneecap is back in place, you may have an X-ray to check the bones are in the correct position and there's no other damage. You'll be sent home with painkillers and your leg will normally be immobilised in a removable splint to begin with. A few weeks of physiotherapy will be recommended to aid your recovery. Surgery is usually only necessary if there was a fracture or another associated injury, such as a ligament tear. It may also be done if you have dislocated your kneecap at least once before. Read more about repeated kneecap dislocations. Recovering from a dislocated kneecap Your knee may hurt at first and you'll probably need to take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. See your GP if this doesn't control the pain. During the first few days, you can help reduce any swelling by keeping your leg elevated when sitting and holding an ice pack to your knee for 10 to 15 minutes every few hours. A physiotherapist will teach you some exercises to do at home to strengthen the muscles that stabilise your kneecap and improve the movement of your knee. The splint should only be kept on for comfort and should be removed to do these exercises as soon as you're able to move your leg. It usually takes about six weeks to fully recover from a dislocated kneecap, although sometimes it can take a bit longer to return to sports or other strenuous activities. Ask your GP, consultant or physiotherapist for advice about returning to your normal activities. If you keep dislocating your kneecap Most people who dislocate their kneecap won't dislocate it again. But in some people it can keep happening. This often occurs if the tissues that support the kneecap are weak or loose, such as in people with hypermobile joints, or because the groove in the bone beneath the kneecap is too shallow or uneven. Regularly doing the exercises your physiotherapist recommends can help strengthen the tissues that hold the kneecap in place and reduce the risk of dislocating it again. Surgery may occasionally be needed if the kneecap keeps dislocating. A common procedure is a medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) repair. This is where the connective tissue (ligament) that helps hold the kneecap in place is repaired and strengthened.

It takes between 12 and 16 weeks to heal after the shoulder has been put back into place. Dislocating your shoulder means the ball joint of your upper arm has popped out of the shoulder socket. The surrounding tissues may also have become overstretched or torn. The shoulder is one of the easiest joints to dislocate because the ball joint sits in a very shallow socket. This makes the arm extremely mobile and able to move in many directions, but also means it's not very stable. Most people dislocate their shoulder during a contact sport such as rugby, or in a sports-related accident. In older people the cause is often falling onto outstretched hands, for example after slipping on ice. Shoulder dislocations can occur more easily in people who are highy flexible, such as those with joint hypermobility (loose joints).  How do I know if I've dislocated my shoulder? In most cases of dislocated shoulder, the ball part of the joint pops out in front of the shoulder socket. This is usually obvious because: you won't be able to move the arm and it will be extremely painful the shoulder will suddenly look square rather than round you may be able to see a lump or bulge (the top of the arm bone) under the skin in front of your shoulder It's much more unusual for the bone to pop out of the back of the shoulder joint. This usually happens after an epileptic fit or electrocution injury and is less easy to spot. What you should do If you think you have dislocated your shoulder, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately. Don't try to pop your arm back in yourself, as this could damage the tissues, nerves and blood vessels around the shoulder joint. While waiting for medical help, avoid moving your upper arm as much as possible. Place something soft, such as a folded blanket or pillow, in the gap between the arm and side of the chest to support it. If you can, make a simple sling to hold the lower arm across the chest, with the elbow bent at a right angle. How a dislocated shoulder is treated When you get to A&E, you will be assessed and examined. You will usually be X-rayed to make sure you haven't broken any bones, as it's fairly common for someone who has dislocated their shoulder to also break the bone of their upper arm or the joint. If you do have a fracture, further scans may also be carried out to investigate it in more detail. Fractures with a shoulder dislocation will require specialist orthopaedic care and may involve surgery. If you don\u2019t have any fractures, your arm will be gently manipulated back into its shoulder joint using a procedure known as reduction. Surgery is sometimes necessary if the tissues surrounding the joint are badly torn and the joint is not stable. If the tissues are overstretched but not torn, surgery can sometimes be avoided by doing appropriate exercises to strengthen the shoulder. Reduction You will be given some medication to sedate you and ensure you are as relaxed and pain-free as possible. Reduction is usually carried out in the A&E department, but sometimes it is done in the operating theatre under general anaesthetic (where you are asleep) under the care of an orthopaedic team. You will usually sit on the bed while the doctor rotates your arm around the shoulder joint until it goes back in its socket. This may take a few minutes. Once the shoulder joint is back in place, you will often have another X-ray to check the shoulder is in the correct position. Repairing tears in the shoulder tissues Some people tear a rotator cuff tendon (bands of tissue that stretch over the top of the shoulder) as well as the labrum (the cuff of tough tissue surrounding and supporting the shoulder joint) when they dislocate their shoulder. If these tissues have been damaged, you may need surgery to repair them. For some people, this can significantly reduce the risk of dislocating the same shoulder again in the future (see below). These operations are carried out under general anaesthetic and are increasingly being done with keyhole surgery, using only small incisions and an arthroscope (a thin tube fitted with a light source and a camera). Recovering from a dislocated shoulder You can usually go home soon after reduction, but you'll need to rest your arm in a sling for a few weeks. You will usually be referred to the orhopaedic department for follow-up care and you may also be referred to a physiotherapist for rehabilitation to strengthen your shoulder. Arm and shoulder exercises You may be asked to rest your arm in the sling for two to three weeks while the soft tissues around the shoulder repair themselves. After this, a physiotherapist can show you some gentle arm and shoulder exercises to do at home with your arm out of its sling. These will help reduce stiffness, relieve some of the pain and build up strength in your shoulder muscles. Before you begin your exercises, hold an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) on the shoulder for 10 to 15 minutes and take some painkillers. For some useful exercises to get you started, see the NHS leaflet: rehabilitation after shoulder dislocation (PDF, 482kb). It's normal to experience aching, discomfort or stretching when doing these exercises. However, if you have intense pain for more than 30 minutes, do the exercise less forcefully and less often. It's better to do short, frequent sessions of five to 10 minutes four times a day rather than one long session, and to gradually increase the number of repetitions you do. Pain relief The shoulder may be very painful during the first two to three weeks at home and you may need to take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. Always follow the dosage instructions on the packet. If this doesn't control the pain, see your GP for a prescription for a stronger painkiller, such as codeine. Recovery time You can stop wearing the sling after a few weeks, but it takes about 12 to 16 weeks to completely recover from a dislocated shoulder. You can usually resume most activities within two weeks, but avoid heavy lifting and playing sports involving shoulder movements for six weeks to three months. Your orthopaedic surgeon and physiotherapist will advise you. You'll probably be off work for two to four weeks, or longer if you have a physical job. Discuss this with your GP, physiotherapist or consultant. If you've also broken your arm or shoulder joint, you may need to wear your sling for up to six weeks and recovery will take longer. Dislocating the shoulder a second time If you've dislocated your shoulder once, you're more likely to dislocate it again in the future \u2013 particularly if you're less than 20 years old. Your chances of another dislocation depend partly on how well the tissues surrounding the joint healed the first time. It can help if the torn tissues were surgically repaired after the dislocated shoulder was fixed. Regularly doing the exercises your physiotherapist recommends and avoiding awkward arm positions can also reduce the risk of dislocating your shoulder again.

Consciousness requires both wakefulness and awareness. Wakefulness is the ability to open your eyes and have basic reflexes such as coughing, swallowing and sucking. Awareness is associated with more complex thought processes and is more difficult to assess. Currently, the assessment of awareness relies on physical responses being detected during an examination. The main disorders of consciousness are: coma vegetative state minimally conscious state Coma A coma is when a person shows no signs of being awake and no signs of being aware. A person in a coma lies with their eyes closed and doesn't respond to their environment, voices or pain. A coma usually lasts for less than two to four weeks, during which time a person may wake up or progress into a vegetative state or minimally conscious state. Read more about comas. Vegetative state A vegetative state is when a person is awake but is showing no signs of awareness. A person in a vegetative state may open their eyes, wake up and fall asleep at regular intervals and have basic reflexes, such as blinking when they're startled by a loud noise, or withdrawing their hand when it's squeezed hard. They're also able to regulate their heartbeat and breathing without assistance. However, a person in a vegetative state doesn't show any meaningful responses, such as following an object with their eyes or responding to voices. They also show no signs of experiencing emotions. If a person is in a vegetative state for a long time, it may be considered to be: a continuing vegetative state \u2013 when it's been longer than four weeks a permanent vegetative state \u2013 when it's been more than six months if caused by a non-traumatic brain injury, or more than 12 months if caused by a traumatic brain injury If a person is diagnosed as being in a permanent vegetative state, recovery is extremely unlikely but not impossible. Minimally conscious state A person who shows clear but minimal or inconsistent awareness is classified as being in a minimally conscious state. They may have periods where they can communicate or respond to commands, such as moving a finger when asked. A person may enter a minimally conscious state after being in a coma or vegetative state. In some cases a minimally conscious state is a stage on the route to recovery, but in others it's permanent. As with vegetative state, a continuing minimally conscious state means it has lasted longer than four weeks. However, it's more difficult to diagnose a permanent minimally conscious state because it depends on things such as: the type of brain injury how severe the injury is how responsive the person is In most cases, a minimally conscious state isn't usually considered to be permanent until it's lasted several years. Why they happen Disorders of consciousness can occur if the parts of the brain involved with consciousness are damaged. These types of brain injury can be divided into: traumatic brain injury \u2013 the result of a severe head injury, such as an injury sustained during a car accident or a fall from a great height non-traumatic brain injury \u2013 where the injury to the brain is caused by a health condition, such as a stroke progressive brain damage \u2013 where the brain is gradually damaged over time; for example, because of Alzheimer's disease Read more about the causes of disorders of consciousness. Making a diagnosis A disorder of consciousness will only be confirmed after extensive testing to determine the person's level of wakefulness and awareness. These examinations need to be carried out by someone experienced in disorders of consciousness, although the views of other healthcare professionals and family members should also be taken into consideration. For some states of impaired consciousness, such as vegetative state and minimally conscious state, there are recommended criteria to help confirm a diagnosis. Read more about diagnosing disorders of consciousness. Treatment and care Treatment can't ensure recovery from a state of impaired consciousness. Instead, supportive treatment is used to give the best chance of natural improvement. This can involve: providing nutrition through a feeding tube  making sure the person is moved regularly so they don't develop pressure ulcers gently exercising their joints to prevent them becoming tight keeping their skin clean managing their bowel and bladder \u2013 for example, using a tube known as a catheter to drain the bladder keeping their teeth and mouth clean offering opportunities for periods of meaningful activity \u2013 such as listening to music or watching television, being shown pictures or hearing family members talking Sensory stimulation In some cases, a treatment called sensory stimulation may be used in an attempt to increase responsiveness. This involves stimulating the main senses, such as vision, hearing and smell. It's usually carried out by a trained specialist, but family members are often encouraged to be involved. Some examples of sensory stimulation include: visual \u2013 showing photos of friends and family, or a favourite film hearing \u2013 talking or playing a favourite song smell \u2013 putting flowers in the room or spraying a favourite perfume touch \u2013 holding their hand or stroking their skin with different fabrics It's not entirely clear how effective sensory stimulation is, but it's sometimes considered worthwhile.  Recovery It's impossible to predict the chances of someone in a state of impaired consciousness improving. It largely depends on: the type of brain injury how severe the injury is the person's age how long they've been in the state for Some people improve gradually, whereas others stay in a state of impaired consciousness for years. Many people never recover consciousness. There are only isolated cases of people recovering consciousness after several years. The few people who do regain consciousness after this time often have severe disabilities caused by the damage to their brain. Withdrawing nutritional support If a person has been in a vegetative state for a minimum of 12 months, it may be recommended that nutritional support is withdrawn. This is because: there's almost no chance of a recovery by this point prolonging life would have no benefit for the person concerned prolonging treatment could offer false hope and cause unnecessary emotional distress for the friends and family of the person concerned The medical team will discuss the issue with family members, but the decision has to be referred to the courts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland before any further action can be taken. In Scotland a court ruling isn't required, but is often sought. If the court agrees with the decision, a palliative care team will usually be involved in planning the withdrawal. Once nutritional support is eventually withdrawn, the person will die within a few days or weeks. Locked-in syndrome Locked-in syndrome has similar features to disorders of consciousness, but is considered and treated differently.  A person with locked-in syndrome is both conscious and aware, but completely paralysed and unable to speak. They're usually able to move their eyes and are sometimes able to communicate by blinking.

If you have a DSD, you will have a mix of male and female sexual characteristics. You may have the sex chromosomes (bundles of genes) normally associated with being female (XX chromosomes) or male (XY chromosomes), but your reproductive organs and genitals may be of the opposite sex, not clearly male nor female (ambiguous or atypical), or a mixture of both. This occurs because of a difference with your genetic make-up and\/or how you respond to the sex hormones in your body. These conditions can be inherited, but often they occur randomly for no apparent reason. Read more about genes and genetics. Types of DSDs There are different types of DSD, and each has a different cause. Below are some examples. Female with ambiguous or male-looking genitals Some people have XX (female) chromosomes with normal ovaries and womb, but their genitals appear ambiguous or male. For example, they may have an enlarged clitoris resembling a penis and their lower vagina may be closed. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX DSD. The most common cause is a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). If your child has CAH, they lack a particular enzyme (protein) that their body needs to make hormones called cortisol and aldosterone. Without these, the body produces more androgens (male sex hormones). If the affected child is female, then the raised androgen levels before birth cause the genitals to become more male in appearance. This condition can also lead to serious health issues, such as life-threatening kidney problems that need to be treated as soon as possible. For support and more information on CAH, you can visit the CAH support group. Female with normal external genitals but some internal male structures Some women have XY (male) chromosomes but their external genitals may appear entirely female or atypical. The womb may be present or absent and the testicles may be absent or not properly formed. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XY DSD. There are several different causes of this condition. One possible cause is androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), where the body ignores androgens or is insensitive to them, so development is female. The testes usually remain inside their body and the womb does not develop. AIS is thought to occur in around one in every 20,000 births, although the exact figures are unknown. For support and more information on AIS, you can visit the AIS Support Group.  A mix of male and female characteristics People with this very rare type of DSD have both ovarian and testicular tissue (for example, one ovary and one testis), and their genitals may appear female, male or a mix of both. Most people with this type of DSD have XX (female) chromosomes and, although the cause is not usually clear, some cases have been linked to genetic material normally found on the Y chromosome becoming misplaced on the X chromosome. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX ovotesticular DSD. Normally formed genitals but abnormal sexual development Some people have neither XY nor XX chromosomes \u2013 for example, they may only have one X chromosome (XO), or they may have an extra chromosome (XXY). Physically, their sex organs are normally formed as either male (testes and a penis) or female (ovaries, womb and a vagina), but they may not go through normal sexual development at puberty. For example, a child with female sex organs may not start having periods and may have small breasts. Doctors refer to this condition as sex chromosome DSD. About one in 600 newborn boys will have the genetic condition Klinefelter syndrome, which means they are born with an extra X chromosome (XXY). Adult males with Klinefelter syndrome may not be able to produce enough testosterone, the sex hormone responsible for the development of male characteristics and important for maintaining bone strength, libido and fertility in men. Girls or women with Turner syndrome are missing an X chromosome, which means they're usually infertile and their height is shorter than average. Female with an absent womb Some females are born with an underdeveloped or absent womb, cervix and upper vagina, but the ovaries and external genitalia (vulva) are still present and they still develop breasts and pubic hair as they get older. This is known as Rokitansky syndrome (also called Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser or MRKH syndrome). It\u2019s thought to affect around one in every 4,000 to 5,000 females. The cause of Rokitansky syndrome is not clear, but it\u2019s not related to the chromosomes because girls and women with it have the normal XX chromosomes. Often the first sign of Rokitansky syndrome is that a girl does not start having periods. Sex may also be difficult because the vagina is shorter than normal. As they have no womb, women with Rokitansky syndrome cannot become pregnant, but it\u2019s sometimes possible to take eggs from their ovaries, fertilise them, and implant them in another women (surrogate). For support and more information on Rokitansky syndrome, you can visit the websites of Living MRKH, the MRKH Organization and the Boston Center for Young Women\u2019s Health. What happens after birth Some cases of DSD are suspected soon after birth because of obvious signs such as undescended testicles or an atypical or ambiguous genital appearance. In such cases, a number of tests may be carried out to help confirm the diagnosis and identify any medical problems that may require immediate treatment. These tests may include a further physical examination of your baby carried out by a specialist, an ultrasound scan to examine their internal organs, and blood tests. Your care team may advise you to delay registering your child's birth for a few days while these tests are carried out. Afterwards, the results will be explained to you and you will have a discussion with specialists about whether to bring your baby up as a boy or a girl. Emergency treatment is rarely needed for a DSD, but the team of specialists can also talk to you about your options regarding immediate or delayed treatment with hormone therapy or surgery. Advice for parents of older children Sometimes a DSD may be diagnosed if an older child does not develop normally in puberty. For example, your child may not start the normal puberty changes or may start puberty but not start periods. You should speak to your GP if you have any concerns about your child\u2019s development at puberty. They should refer your child to a specialist, usually a consultant in paediatric endocrinology or an adolescent gynaecologist. A team of different healthcare professionals will work together to understand your child's condition and offer you and your child support and advice. As your child grows up, they may need hormone therapy and psychological support, and they may eventually decide they want surgery to change their physical appearance. With the right care and support, many people with DSDs come to terms with their condition and live happily. If you think you have a DSD If you think or know that you have a DSD, help and support is available. You should speak to your GP initially, as they will be able to refer you to a team of specialist healthcare professionals who can offer support and advice. Most people with a DSD stay with the gender they were assigned as a baby, but if you feel the gender you were assigned does not represent who you are, you may wish to change your gender. This will be something you can discuss with your team of specialists. If you have a DSD, you may be infertile and you may need hormone therapy and psychological support, but the right care and support can help you come to terms with your condition and lead a normal life. Support groups If you have a DSD, or you are the parent of a child who does, you may find it useful to contact or join a support group. These groups can often offer more information and advice about living with a DSD, and they may be able to put you in contact with others who have been in a similar situation to you. National DSD support groups include: DSD Families Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Support Group MRKH UK Your care team may also be able to recommend support groups in your local area. Terminology Disorders of sex development (DSDs) are also sometimes called intersex conditions. Some doctors also used to refer to a person with a DSD as a hermaphrodite. However, this term is longer used as it is misleading and can be insensitive. DSDs should not be confused with gender dysphoria, which is also known as transsexuality or being transgender. Gender dysphoria is where the reproductive organs and genitals have developed normally, but the person feels that their gender identity (their sense of what sex they are) does not match their biological sex.

Someone with a dissociative disorder may have memory loss or may feel: that their body or the world around them is unreal uncertain about who they are that they have many different identities Most people affected by this disorder will have experienced a traumatic event during childhood. They 'dissociate', or switch off from reality, to cope with it (the box on this page explains what 'dissociation' means). This feeling of being disconnected from yourself or from the world can be extremely distressing, significantly affecting work and personal life. It can affect people at any age and is nothing to do with a head injury or underlying health condition \u2013 it's the result of the brain adapting to a difficult early life. If you have been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder, or a friend or family member has, read on. This page explains three main types of dissociative disorders: dissociative amnesia depersonalisation-derealisation disorder  dissociative identity disorder It then explains what we know about the cause of dissociative disorders, other conditions commonly associated with dissociative disorders, and how dissociative disorders are treated. What is dissociative amnesia? Someone with dissociative amnesia will repeatedly have periods where they cannot remember information about themselves or about events in their past life. They may also forget a learnt talent or skill. These gaps in memory are much more severe than normal forgetfulness, and are not the result of an underlying medical condition. Some people with dissociative amnesia will find themselves in a strange place without knowing how they got there. They may have travelled there purposefully, or wandered in a confused state. These blank episodes may last minutes, hours or days \u2013 and rarely, months or years. What is depersonalisation-derealisation disorder? 'Depersonalisation' means feeling detached from yourself, observing yourself and your feelings and thoughts as if they belong to someone else you are watching in a movie. Some of the typical symptoms are: out-of-body experiences loss of feeling in parts of your body distorted views of your body unable to recognise your image in a mirror a sense of detachment from your emotions feeling like you are watching a movie of yourself feeling like you are unreal 'Derealisation' means seeing other people and the environment around you as dream-like and unreal. Objects may change in shape, size or colour. Typical symptoms are: feeling like a normal environment is unfamiliar a sense that what is happening is unreal feeling detached from the world a perception of objects changing shape, colour, size feeling that people you know are strangers You might experience one or both of these problems if you have been diagnosed with depersonalisation-derealisation disorder, and will probably be aware that these experiences aren't reality. Episodes of depersonalisation or derealisation may last just a few moments and come and go over many years, or may be ongoing. What is dissociative identity disorder? Dissociative identity disorder, or 'multiple personality disorder', is the most extreme of the three types. If you've been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, you may feel uncertain about who you are and struggle to define yourself. You may feel the presence of other identities, which may each have their own names, voices, personal histories and mannerisms. Typical symptoms are: feeling like a stranger to yourself being confused about your sexuality or gender feeling like there are different people within you referring to yourself as 'we' behaving out of character writing in different handwriting What's the cause? Many people with a dissociative disorder will have experienced a traumatic event in the past. Often, this traumatic event will have been physical, sexual or emotional abuse suffered during childhood, although some people 'dissociate' after experiencing war, kidnapping or even an invasive medical procedure. Switching off from reality is a normal defence mechanism that helps the person to cope during a traumatic time \u2013 it's a form of denial, as if \"this isn't happening to me\". It becomes dysfunctional when the environment is no longer traumatic but the person still acts and lives as if it is, and hasn't dealt with or processed the event. So, a dissociative disorder is the result of the brain adapting to a difficult early life environment. It is not: to do with genes the result of another medical condition the result of a head injury the result of drug or alcohol abuse (although many people with dissociative disorders misuse alcohol or drugs to cope) What are the some of the associated conditions? Someone with a dissociative disorder may also suffer from: post-traumatic stress disorder  depression  mood swings anxiety and panic attacks suicidal tendencies and\/or self-harm headaches hearing voices  sleep disorders phobias  an eating disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder  How are dissociative disorders treated? If you have been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder, a mental health specialist will want to ask you more questions about how you are feeling and find out whether you suffered any trauma in the past. It's important to be honest about your symptoms, and not feel ashamed or embarrassed, so you can receive the help and support you need. Some people with dissociative disorders will benefit from a course of psychotherapy or counselling. This talking therapy aims to help you cope with the underlying cause of your symptoms, and helps you to manage the periods of feeling disconnected. Read more about how psychotherapy works. If you have suffered a traumatic event in the past, you might benefit from a technique called eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). EMDR has been found to reduce the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. It involves making side-to-side eye movements, usually by following the movement of the therapist's finger, while recalling the traumatic incident. It is not clear exactly how EMDR works, but it may help the malfunctioning part of the brain to process distressing memories and flashbacks so that they have less influence over your mind. Read more about EMDR. There is no medication to specifically treat dissociation, although medication may be prescribed to treat any depression, anxiety and insomnia. Read about the: treatment of depression treatment of anxiety treatment of insomnia Many people make a full recovery with treatment and support. If you're feeling suicidal If you are reading this because you have, or have had, thoughts about taking your own life, it's important you ask someone for help. It's probably difficult for you to see it at this time, but you're not alone and not beyond help.   There are people you can talk to who want to help: speak to a friend, family member or someone you trust as they may be able to help you calm down and find some breathing space call the Samaritans 24-hour support service on 08457 90 90 90 go to, or call, your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department and tell the staff how you are feeling contact NHS 111 make an urgent appointment to see your GP Read more about getting help if you're feeling suicidal. If you are worried that someone you know may be considering suicide, try to encourage them to talk about how they are feeling. Listening is the best way to help. Try to avoid offering solutions and try not to judge.  If they have previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition, such as depression, you can speak to a member of their care team for help and advice. Read more about suicide warning signs and how you can help someone with suicidal thoughts.

'Dissociation' means a period when we feel disconnected from the environment and\/or from ourselves. We all have these moments of disconnection from time to time \u2013 daydreaming while driving, or switching off and missing part of a conversation, for example. These moments of 'not being with it' normally pass quickly. Someone with a dissociative disorder has persistent, repeated episodes of dissociation that are extreme enough to severely affect everyday life.

Someone with a dissociative disorder may have memory loss or may feel: that their body or the world around them is unreal uncertain about who they are that they have many different identities Most people affected by this disorder will have experienced a traumatic event during childhood. They 'dissociate', or switch off from reality, to cope with it (the box on this page explains what 'dissociation' means). This feeling of being disconnected from yourself or from the world can be extremely distressing, significantly affecting work and personal life. It can affect people at any age and is nothing to do with a head injury or underlying health condition \u2013 it's the result of the brain adapting to a difficult early life. If you have been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder, or a friend or family member has, read on. This page explains three main types of dissociative disorders: dissociative amnesia depersonalisation-derealisation disorder  dissociative identity disorder It then explains what we know about the cause of dissociative disorders, other conditions commonly associated with dissociative disorders, and how dissociative disorders are treated. What is dissociative amnesia? Someone with dissociative amnesia will repeatedly have periods where they cannot remember information about themselves or about events in their past life. They may also forget a learnt talent or skill. These gaps in memory are much more severe than normal forgetfulness, and are not the result of an underlying medical condition. Some people with dissociative amnesia will find themselves in a strange place without knowing how they got there. They may have travelled there purposefully, or wandered in a confused state. These blank episodes may last minutes, hours or days \u2013 and rarely, months or years. What is depersonalisation-derealisation disorder? 'Depersonalisation' means feeling detached from yourself, observing yourself and your feelings and thoughts as if they belong to someone else you are watching in a movie. Some of the typical symptoms are: out-of-body experiences loss of feeling in parts of your body distorted views of your body unable to recognise your image in a mirror a sense of detachment from your emotions feeling like you are watching a movie of yourself feeling like you are unreal 'Derealisation' means seeing other people and the environment around you as dream-like and unreal. Objects may change in shape, size or colour. Typical symptoms are: feeling like a normal environment is unfamiliar a sense that what is happening is unreal feeling detached from the world a perception of objects changing shape, colour, size feeling that people you know are strangers You might experience one or both of these problems if you have been diagnosed with depersonalisation-derealisation disorder, and will probably be aware that these experiences aren't reality. Episodes of depersonalisation or derealisation may last just a few moments and come and go over many years, or may be ongoing. What is dissociative identity disorder? Dissociative identity disorder, or 'multiple personality disorder', is the most extreme of the three types. If you've been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, you may feel uncertain about who you are and struggle to define yourself. You may feel the presence of other identities, which may each have their own names, voices, personal histories and mannerisms. Typical symptoms are: feeling like a stranger to yourself being confused about your sexuality or gender feeling like there are different people within you referring to yourself as 'we' behaving out of character writing in different handwriting What's the cause? Many people with a dissociative disorder will have experienced a traumatic event in the past. Often, this traumatic event will have been physical, sexual or emotional abuse suffered during childhood, although some people 'dissociate' after experiencing war, kidnapping or even an invasive medical procedure. Switching off from reality is a normal defence mechanism that helps the person to cope during a traumatic time \u2013 it's a form of denial, as if \"this isn't happening to me\". It becomes dysfunctional when the environment is no longer traumatic but the person still acts and lives as if it is, and hasn't dealt with or processed the event. So, a dissociative disorder is the result of the brain adapting to a difficult early life environment. It is not: to do with genes the result of another medical condition the result of a head injury the result of drug or alcohol abuse (although many people with dissociative disorders misuse alcohol or drugs to cope) What are the some of the associated conditions? Someone with a dissociative disorder may also suffer from: post-traumatic stress disorder  depression  mood swings anxiety and panic attacks suicidal tendencies and\/or self-harm headaches hearing voices  sleep disorders phobias  an eating disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder  How are dissociative disorders treated? If you have been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder, a mental health specialist will want to ask you more questions about how you are feeling and find out whether you suffered any trauma in the past. It's important to be honest about your symptoms, and not feel ashamed or embarrassed, so you can receive the help and support you need. Some people with dissociative disorders will benefit from a course of psychotherapy or counselling. This talking therapy aims to help you cope with the underlying cause of your symptoms, and helps you to manage the periods of feeling disconnected. Read more about how psychotherapy works. If you have suffered a traumatic event in the past, you might benefit from a technique called eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). EMDR has been found to reduce the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. It involves making side-to-side eye movements, usually by following the movement of the therapist's finger, while recalling the traumatic incident. It is not clear exactly how EMDR works, but it may help the malfunctioning part of the brain to process distressing memories and flashbacks so that they have less influence over your mind. Read more about EMDR. There is no medication to specifically treat dissociation, although medication may be prescribed to treat any depression, anxiety and insomnia. Read about the: treatment of depression treatment of anxiety treatment of insomnia Many people make a full recovery with treatment and support. If you're feeling suicidal If you are reading this because you have, or have had, thoughts about taking your own life, it's important you ask someone for help. It's probably difficult for you to see it at this time, but you're not alone and not beyond help.   There are people you can talk to who want to help: speak to a friend, family member or someone you trust as they may be able to help you calm down and find some breathing space call the Samaritans 24-hour support service on 08457 90 90 90 go to, or call, your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department and tell the staff how you are feeling contact NHS 111 make an urgent appointment to see your GP Read more about getting help if you're feeling suicidal. If you are worried that someone you know may be considering suicide, try to encourage them to talk about how they are feeling. Listening is the best way to help. Try to avoid offering solutions and try not to judge.  If they have previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition, such as depression, you can speak to a member of their care team for help and advice.

'Dissociation' means a period when we feel disconnected from the environment and\/or from ourselves. We all have these moments of disconnection from time to time \u2013 daydreaming while driving, or switching off and missing part of a conversation, for example. These moments of 'not being with it' normally pass quickly. Someone with a dissociative disorder has persistent, repeated episodes of dissociation that are extreme enough to severely affect everyday life.

In diverticular disease, small bulges or pockets (diverticula) develop in the lining of the intestine. Diverticulitis is when these pockets become inflamed or infected. Symptoms of diverticular disease include: lower abdominal pain feeling bloated The majority of people with diverticula will not have any symptoms; this is known as diverticulosis. Symptoms of diverticulitis tend to be more serious and include: more severe abdominal pain, especially on the left side high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above diarrhoea or frequent bowel movements Read more about the symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis. Diverticulosis, diverticular disease and diverticulitis Diverticula \"Diverticula\" is the medical term used to describe the small bulges that stick out of the side of the large intestine (colon). Diverticula are common and associated with ageing. The large intestine becomes weaker with age, and the pressure of hard stools passing through the large intestine is thought to cause the bulges to form. Read more about the causes of diverticula. It's estimated that 5% of people have diverticula by the time they are 40 years old, and at least 50% of people have them by the time they are 80 years old. Diverticular disease One in four people who develop diverticula will experience symptoms, such as abdominal pain. Having symptoms associated with diverticula is known as diverticular disease. Diverticulitis Diverticulitis describes infection that occurs when bacteria becomes trapped inside one of the bulges, triggering more severe symptoms. Diverticulitis can lead to complications, such as an abscess next to the intestine. Read more about the complications of diverticulitis. Treating diverticular disease and diverticulitis A high-fibre diet can often ease symptoms of diverticular disease, and paracetamol can be used to relieve pain \u2013 other painkillers such as aspirin or ibuprofen are not recommended for regular use, as they can cause stomach upsets. Speak to your GP if paracetamol alone is not working. Mild diverticulitis can usually be treated at home with antibiotics prescribed by your GP. More serious cases may need hospital treatment to prevent and treat complications. Surgery to remove the affected section of the intestine is sometimes recommended if there have been serious complications, although this is rare. Read more about treating diverticular disease and diverticulitis. Who is affected Diverticular disease is one of the most common digestive conditions. There were 113,983 hospital admissions due to diverticulitis in England in 2012-13. Both sexes are equally affected by diverticular disease and diverticulitis, although the condition is more likely to appear at a younger age (under 50) in men than in women. Overall, symptoms of diverticulitis are most likely to occur in people over 70 years old. Diverticular disease is often described as a \"Western disease\" because the rates are high in European and North American countries, and low in African and Asian countries. A combination of genetics and diet is thought to be the reason for this and the fact that people in Western countries tend to eat less fibre. People aged 50-70 who eat a high-fibre diet (25g a day) have a 40% lower chance of admission to hospital with complications of diverticular disease \u2013 compared to others in their age range with the lowest amount of dietary fibre.

Media last reviewed: Next review due: Fibre Most people with diverticular disease are recommended to eat between 18g (0.6oz) and 30g (1oz) of fibre a day. Your GP can provide a more specific target, based on your individual height and weight. Good sources of fibre include fresh fruit \u2013 such as pears, apples and oranges dried fruit \u2013 such as apricots and prunes vegetables \u2013 such as broccoli and peas legumes \u2013 such as baked beans, kidney beans and black beans nuts \u2013 such as almonds and peanuts breakfast cereals \u2013 such as high-fibre breakfast flakes starchy foods \u2013 such as brown bread, rice and pasta It's recommended that you gradually increase your fibre intake over the course of a few weeks. This will help prevent side effects associated with a high-fibre diet, such as bloating and flatulence (wind). Drink plenty of fluids, because this will help prevent side effects. Fibre supplements \u2013 usually in the form of sachets of powder that you mix with water \u2013 are also available from pharmacists and health food shops. Read more about how a high-fibre diet can help prevent diverticular disease and why fibre is important to health.

The term \"dizziness\" means different things to different people \u2013 some use it to describe feeling lightheaded or off balance, while others use it to describe a feeling that their surroundings are spinning. Because the symptom is quite vague and can be caused by a wide range of things, it may not always be easy to identify the underlying cause of dizziness. This page explains what you should do if you feel dizzy for no apparent reason, and outlines the most common causes. Seeing your GP  See your GP if you're feeling lightheaded or off balance and you're worried, particularly if you also have other symptoms, such as fainting episodes or headaches. Your GP will first want to establish exactly what you mean by dizziness, and check that you're not actually describing vertigo \u2013 a severe type of dizziness, where you feel your surroundings are spinning or moving. They\u2019ll also want to know: whether the dizziness started for no apparent reason, or if it followed an illness whether you have repeated episodes of dizziness and, if so, when you tend to experience these how long the dizziness lasts Dizziness can sometimes be caused by an ear condition. A simple way of distinguishing between ear-related dizziness and dizziness due to other causes is to determine whether it occurs only when you're upright or also when you're lying down. Dizziness that occurs when you're upright is probably not related to the ear. Dizziness that happens when you're lying down is usually caused by a viral ear infection, which can't be treated with antibiotics. It\u2019s a good idea to keep a diary of your dizziness, recording when and where you experience the problem, and take it with you to your GP appointment. It's helpful to note: what you were doing at the time of your dizziness how long it lasted and how bad it was whether you had any other symptoms \u2013 such as fainting, vomiting, nausea, blurred vision, headache, hearing loss or tinnitus If you're taking prescription medicine, your GP will probably review this to check whether dizziness is a possible side effect. If necessary, they can prescribe a different medication for you to try. You may be referred to a specialist for further tests and investigations. Common causes of dizziness The most common causes of dizziness are outlined below. Labyrinthitis \u2013 an inner ear infection that affects your hearing and balance, and can lead to a severe form of dizziness called vertigo. Migraine \u2013 dizziness may come on before or after the headache, or even without the headache. Stress or anxiety \u2013 particularly if you tend to hyperventilate (breathe abnormally quickly when resting). Low blood sugar level (hypoglycaemia)  \u2013 which is usually seen in people with diabetes. Postural hypotension \u2013 a sudden fall in blood pressure when you suddenly sit or stand up, which goes away after lying down. This is more common in older people. Dehydration or heat exhaustion \u2013 dehydration could be due to not drinking enough during exercise, or illness that causes vomiting, diarrhoea or fever. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency \u2013 decreased blood flow in the back of the brain, which may be caused by the blood vessels that lead to the brain from the heart being blocked (known as atherosclerosis). Click on the above links for more information on these conditions. Less common causes of dizziness Less common causes of dizziness include: having a severe illness or condition that affects the whole body using recreational drugs or consuming excessive amounts of alcohol (either binge drinking or long-term alcohol misuse) certain types of prescription medicine \u2013 such as antidepressants or blood pressure medication having a heart rhythm problem \u2013 such as atrial fibrillation (a fast, irregular heartbeat) carbon monoxide poisoning Click on the above links for more information on these conditions.

Always seek medical advice if you've been bitten by an animal or person and the bite has broken the skin. People and animals have a lot of bacteria in their mouths, which can cause an infection if a bite breaks the skin. These infections are rarely serious if treated quickly, but occasionally they can spread to the blood or other parts of the body. Serious infections such as tetanus and rabies are extremely rare in the UK, but it's important to get serious bites looked at as treatment to prevent these infections may be recommended. The following information is about bites by people and animals such as dogs and cats. There are separate pages on insect bites and snake bites. This page covers: What to do if you've been bitten When to get medical advice Signs that a bite may be infected Common causes of bites How to avoid animal bites What to do if you've been bitten If you've been bitten by an animal or another person: clean the wound immediately by running warm tap water over it for a couple of minutes \u2013 it's a good idea to do this even if the skin doesn't appear to be broken remove any objects from the bite, such as teeth, hair or dirt encourage the wound to bleed slightly by gently squeezing it, unless it's already bleeding freely if the wound is bleeding heavily, put a clean pad or sterile dressing over it and apply pressure dry the wound and cover it with a clean dressing or plaster take painkillers if you're in pain, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen \u2013 children under 16 years old shouldn't take aspirin seek medical advice, unless the wound is very minor If the bite has severed a body part like a finger or ear, wash it with tap water, wrap it in clean tissue, and store it in a plastic bag surrounded by ice so it can be transported to hospital. It may be possible to surgically reattach the body part later on. When to seek medical advice If the bite has broken the skin, you should seek immediate medical attention after cleaning the wound. Don't delay seeking help until symptoms of infection appear. Minor bites can be treated at your GP surgery, or by staff at your local walk-in centre or minor injuries unit. For particularly severe bites, visit your local accident and emergency (A&E) department. The healthcare professional treating you may: clean the wound and remove any damaged tissue prescribe a course of antibiotics to prevent infection recommend specific treatment to prevent infections such as tetanus if you're felt to be at risk close the wound with stitches if the risk of infection is thought to be low \u2013 high-risk wounds will usually be left open as this means they're easier to keep clean arrange blood tests to check for infection, or an X-ray to check for any damage to your bones and see if there's anything embedded in your wound, such as a tooth refer you for an assessment by a specialist if the bite penetrated a joint, or there's severe damage, such as damage to bones or nerves \u2013 surgery may be needed in these cases if you're bitten by a person with hepatitis or HIV, there's a tiny chance of the infection spreading if the bite is contaminated with blood, so you may be offered treatment to stop you becoming infected When you return home, watch out for signs of a possible infection. Signs a bite may be infected Symptoms that suggest a wound has become infected include: redness and swelling around the wound the wound feels warm and increasingly painful liquid or pus leaks from the wound a fever of 38C (100.4F) or above sweats and chills swollen glands under the chin or in the neck, armpits or groin red streaks extending along the skin from the wound Get medical help as soon as possible if you think your wound is infected. When do bites happen? Although you may be more worried about bites from wild and stray animals, any animal has the potential to bite. Many bites are actually caused by a person's own pet or an animal belonging to a friend or neighbour. Animals can act unpredictably and bites aren't always provoked. However, an animal is more likely to bite if it's been disturbed, feels threatened, or gets overexcited. Most human bites occur when one person punches another person in the mouth. They can also happen during contact sports, vigorous sex, domestic violence or sexual assault, and fits (seizures). How to avoid animal bites Most animal bites are caused by dogs. The advice below may help reduce the chances of being bitten: never leave a young child unsupervised with a dog \u2013 regardless of what type of dog it is and its previous behaviour treat dogs with respect \u2013 don't approach them suddenly, run around screaming in their presence, or interrupt them when they're eating or sleeping avoid stroking or petting unfamiliar dogs \u2013 when greeting a dog for the first time, let it sniff you before petting it It's also a good idea to avoid contact with any wild or stray animals, particularly while travelling abroad, as they can be aggressive and there's a chance they could carry serious infections, such as rabies.

The two images may be one on top of the other, side by side, or a mix of both. Double vision may be constant, it may come and go, or it may only occur when you're looking in a particular direction. The cause of your double vision depends on whether your double vision is coming from one eye (monocular) or both eyes (binocular). This also affects which treatment you receive. Treatment ranges from special glasses and eye exercises, to surgery to remove a cataract. Read more about treating double vision. Recognising double vision in children Adults are able to describe what is happening with their sight, but young children may not be able to explain what is wrong clearly. If your child has double vision, they may narrow or squint their eyes closed in an effort to see better, or they may frequently cover one eye with their hand. They may also turn their head in unusual ways (for example, tilting their head) or look sideways instead of facing forward to try to avoid double vision. When to see your GP Visit your GP as soon as possible if you develop double vision or you suspect your child has double vision or a squint. If you've never had double vision before, it's important to have it checked as it could be a symptom of a serious medical condition. Your GP will probably refer you to an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) at your local hospital, or an orthoptist (eye movement specialist). Tests for double vision in hospital Your eyecare team will usually start by assessing your vision. They may ask you to read letters off a chart, measure any current glasses, look at the position of your eyes, and assess how well you can move them. They may also assess how well your eyes are working together (your binocular vision). Your ophthalmologist will also use a microscope with a very bright light called a slit lamp to examine the front and back of your eyes. These results, together with your medical history and any other symptoms you have, should determine what could be causing your double vision. Further tests Further tests depend on whether the double vision is monocular or binocular, but may include taking images of your eye. A picture of your brain or eye muscles may also be taken using: a computerised tomography (CT) scan, which takes a series of X-rays at slightly different angles and uses a computer to put the images together a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images Blood tests may also be used to check for an underlying condition. What causes binocular double vision? Each eye creates its own slightly different image because the two eyes are physically located in different positions. However, you usually only see one image. This is because your brain joins the images produced by each eye together into a single image in a process known as fusion. If your eye muscles or nerves are damaged, the muscles may not be able to control your eyes properly and you may develop double vision. Your eye muscles can also be weakened as a result of a health condition, or your eyes may not be aligned properly. This is sometimes known as a squint. Adults who had a squint as a child may sometimes develop double vision over time. Read more about the causes of double vision. What causes monocular double vision? Double vision in one eye is known as monocular double vision. You should be able to see normally if the affected eye is covered, but double vision continues when the unaffected eye is covered. In cases of monocular double vision, the two images are often only slightly separated. This is sometimes referred to as \"ghosting\". Causes of monocular double vision can include: refractive errors \u2013 such as short-sightedness or long-sightedness corneal disease cataracts retinal abnormalities Double vision in both eyes Double vision in both eyes is known as binocular double vision. It happens when both eyes fail to work together properly. If you have binocular double vision, your vision will usually return to normal if either eye is covered. Physiological double vision You may experience physiological double vision when objects in your background field of vision, which you're not specifically focusing on, appear double. Your brain usually compensates for this type of double vision, and it often goes unnoticed. However, children who complain of having double vision sometimes have physiological double vision. Driving If you have just developed double vision, or you have other eye-related conditions, your driving ability is likely to be affected. Check with your GP or ophthalmologist (eye care specialist) if you have an eye condition and you're unsure whether it affects your ability to drive safely. If problems with your vision affect your ability to drive and you hold a current driving licence, it's your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). Visit the GOV.UK website to find out how to tell the DVLA about a medical condition.

Around 775 babies are born with the condition each year in England and Wales. Many babies born with Down's syndrome are diagnosed with the condition after birth and are likely to have: reduced muscle tone leading to floppiness (hypotonia) eyes that slant upwards and outwards a small mouth with a protruding tongue a flat back of the head below-average weight and length at birth Although children with Down's syndrome share some common physical characteristics, they do not all look the same. A child with Down's syndrome will look more like their mother, father or other family members than other children with the syndrome. People with Down's syndrome also vary in personality and ability. Everyone born with Down's syndrome will have a degree of learning disability, but the level of disability will be different for each individual. Read more about the characteristics of Down's syndrome. Screening for Down's syndrome In some cases, babies with the condition are identified before birth as a result of screening for Down's syndrome. Screening tests can't tell you for definite if your baby has Down's syndrome, but they can tell you how likely it is. If screening suggests there is a chance your baby does have Down's syndrome, further tests can be carried out during pregnancy to confirm it. If testing indicates your child will be born with Down's syndrome, you should be offered genetic counselling to allow you and your partner to discuss the impact of the diagnosis. You may also be offered an appointment to meet a doctor or other health professional who works with children with Down's syndrome, who can also tell you more about the condition and answer any questions you may have. Read more about diagnosing Down's syndrome. What causes Down's syndrome? Down's syndrome is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 in a baby's cells. In the vast majority of cases, this isn't inherited and is simply the result of a one-off genetic mistake in the sperm or egg. There is a small chance of having a child with Down's syndrome with every pregnancy, but the likelihood increases with the age of the mother. For example, a woman who is 20 has about a 1 in 1,500 chance of having a baby with the condition, while a woman who is 40 has a 1 in 100 chance. There is no evidence that anything done before or during pregnancy increases or decreases the chance of having a child with Down's syndrome. Read more about the causes of Down's syndrome. Life with Down's syndrome Although there is no \"cure\" for Down's syndrome, there are ways to help children with the condition develop into healthy and fulfilled individuals who are able to achieve the level of independence right for them. This includes: access to good healthcare, including a range of different specialists early intervention programmes to provide support for children and parents good parenting skills and an ordinary family life education and support groups to provide information and help for parents, friends and families Improved education and support has led to more opportunities for people with Down's syndrome. These include being able to leave home, form new relationships, gain employment and lead largely independent lives. However, it is important to remember each child is different and it is not possible to predict how individuals will develop. Read more about living with Down's syndrome. Care and support If you have Down's syndrome or care for someone who has Down's syndrome, it may be useful to read your guide to care and support. This guide is for people with care and support needs, as well as their carers and relatives. It includes information and advice on: practical support for carers  parenting children with complex needs  tips on caring for a disabled child  children and young people's services  Associated health conditions There are a number of disorders that are more common in people with Down's syndrome. These include: hearing and vision problems heart disorders, such as congenital heart disease thyroid problems, such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) recurrent infections, such as pneumonia Your child may be checked by a paediatrician more often than other children to pick up developing problems as early as possible. If you have any concerns about your child's health, discuss them with your GP, health visitor or paediatrician.

What is the test for Down syndrome? Media last reviewed: 17\/03\/2014 Next review due: 17\/03\/2017 Screening for Down's, Edwards' and Patau's syndromes Pregnant women are offered a screening test for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome from 10-14 weeks of pregnancy. This is to assess your chance of having a baby with these conditions. Down's syndrome is also called Trisomy 21 or T21. Edwards' syndrome is also called Trisomy 18 or T18, and Patau's syndrome is also called Trisomy 13 or T13. The screening test offered at 10-14 weeks is called the combined test. It involves a blood test and an ultrasound scan. All women in England are offered screening for Down\u2019s syndrome using this test. Screening for Patau\u2019s and Edwards\u2019 syndromes using the combined test started in 2015 and will be available across England by April 2016. If you are too far into your pregnancy to have the combined test, you will be offered other tests. For Down\u2019s syndrome, a blood test called the quadruple test is available from weeks 14-20 of pregnancy. For Patau\u2019s and Edwards\u2019 syndromes, you will be offered a mid-pregnancy scan that checks for physical abnormalities. If a screening test shows that you have a higher risk of having a baby with Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes, you will be offered diagnostic tests to find out for certain if your baby has the condition. What are Down's, Edwards' and Patau's syndromes? Inside the cells of our bodies there are tiny structures called chromosomes. Chromosomes carry the genes that determine how we develop. There are 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell. Problems can occur when sperm or egg cells are produced, which can lead to a baby having an extra chromosome.  Read more about chromosomes. Down's syndrome In Down's syndrome, there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 in each cell. A baby born with Down's syndrome will have a learning disability. This means they will find it harder than most people to understand and learn new things. They may have communication problems and difficulty managing some everyday tasks. It is impossible to know what level of learning disability a baby with Down's syndrome will have. It can vary from mild to severe. Most children with Down's syndrome attend mainstream primary school. People with Down's syndrome can have a good quality of life. With support from their family and others, many people are able to get jobs and live fairly independently. Some health problems are more common in people with Down's syndrome, such as heart conditions and problems with the digestive system, hearing and vision. Sometimes these problems can be serious, but many can be treated. With good healthcare, someone with Down's syndrome can live to around 60. People with Down's syndrome have almond-shaped eyes and distinctive facial features, but they do not all look the same. Like all children, they also inherit features from their parents. Read more about Down's syndrome. Edwards' and Patau's syndromes In Edwards' syndrome, there is an extra copy of chromosome 18 in each cell. In Patau's syndrome, there is an extra copy of chromosome 13 in each cell. Sadly, most babies with Edwards' or Patau's syndromes will die before they are born or die shortly after birth. Some babies may survive to adulthood, but this is rare. All babies born with Edwards' or Patau's syndromes will have a wide range of problems, which are usually very serious. These may include major brain abnormalities. Babies affected by Edwards' syndrome can have heart problems, unusual head and facial features, growth problems, and be unable to stand or walk. Edwards' syndrome affects about 3 out of every 10,000 births. Babies affected by Patau's syndrome can have heart problems, a cleft lip and palate, growth problems, poorly formed eyes and ears, problems with their kidneys, and be unable to stand or walk. Patau's syndrome affects about 2 out of every 10,000 births. Read more about Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome. What does screening for Down's, Edwards' and Patau's syndromes involve? A screening test for Down's, Edwards' and Patau's syndromes is available from weeks 10-14 of pregnancy. It is called the combined test because it combines an ultrasound scan with a blood test. The scan can be carried out at the same time as the pregnancy dating scan. If you choose to have the test, a blood sample will be taken from you. At the scan, the fluid at the back of the baby's neck is measured (known as the nuchal translucency). Your age and the information from these two tests is used to work out the risk of the baby having Down's syndrome, or Edwards' or Patau's syndromes. It is not always possible to obtain a nuchal transparency measurement, and depends on the position of the baby. If this is the case, you will be offered a different blood screening test to take place from weeks 14-20.  If you are too far on in your pregnancy (more than 14 weeks) to have the combined test, you will be offered a test called the quadruple blood screening test from 14-20 weeks of pregnancy. This blood test only screens for Down\u2019s syndrome and is not quite as accurate as the combined test. For Edwards' and Patau's syndromes, if you are too far into your pregnancy to have the combined test, you will be offered a mid-pregnancy scan. This scan looks for physical abnormalities and 11 rare conditions, including Edwards\u2019 and Patau\u2019s syndromes. Can this screening test harm me or my baby? The screening test cannot harm you or the baby, but it is important to consider carefully whether to have this test. It cannot tell you for certain if the baby has or does not have Down's, Edward's or Patau's syndromes. The test can provide information that may lead to further important decisions. For example, you may be offered diagnostic tests that can tell you for certain whether the baby has these conditions, but these tests have a risk of miscarriage. Do I need to have screening for Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes? You do not need to have this screening test \u2013 it is your choice whether or not to have it. Some people want to find out the risk of their baby having these conditions, and some do not. You can choose to have screening for: all the conditions (Down's, Edwards' and Patau's syndromes) Down's syndrome only Edwards' and Patau's syndromes only none of the conditions What if I decide not to have this test? If you choose not to have the screening test for Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes, you can still choose to have other tests, such as a dating scan. If you choose not to have the screening test for these conditions, it is important to understand that if you have a scan at any point during your pregnancy, it could pick up physical abnormalities. The person scanning you will always tell you if any abnormalities are found. Getting your results The screening test will not tell you if your baby has or does not have Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes. It will tell you if you have a higher or lower risk of having a baby with one of these conditions. If you have screening for all three syndromes, you will receive one risk for Down's syndrome and one combined risk for Edwards' and Patau's syndromes (two risks altogether). If your screening test shows a lower-risk result, you should be told within two weeks of the test being taken. If your screening test shows a higher-risk result, you should be told within three working days of the blood test result being available. This may take a little longer if your test is sent to another hospital. It may be worth asking the midwife what happens in your area and when you can expect to get your results. You will be offered an appointment to discuss the test results and the options you will have. The charity Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC) offers lots of information about screening results and the options you face if you get a higher-risk result. There is also an ARC forum, where you can be put in touch with people who are in the same situation as you. You can read about people's experiences of deciding to continue a pregnancy on the ARC website. Possible results If the screening test shows that the chance of having a baby with Down's, Edwards' and Patau's syndromes is lower than 1 in 150, this is a lower-risk result. More than 95 out of 100 screening test results (95%) will be lower risk. A lower-risk result does not mean there is no risk at all of the baby having Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes. If the screening test shows that the chance of the baby having Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes is higher than 1 in 150 (that is, between 1 in 2 and 1 in 150), this is called a higher-risk result. Fewer than 1 in 20 test results (5%) will be higher risk. This means that out of 100 women accepting screening for Down's, Edwards' and Patau's syndromes, fewer than 5 will have a higher-risk result. A higher-risk result does not mean the baby definitely has Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes. Will I need further tests? If you have a lower-risk result, you will not be offered a further test. If you have a higher-risk result, you will be offered a diagnostic test, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This will tell you for certain whether the baby has Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndrome or not. About 1 in 100 diagnostic tests (1%) result in a miscarriage. It is up to you whether or not to have the further tests. When trying to decide whether to have a diagnostic test, try to balance up the risk of miscarriage with how important the result will be to you. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) This diagnostic test is usually done from weeks 11-14 of pregnancy. A fine needle, usually put through the mother's abdomen, is used to take a tiny sample of tissue from the placenta. The cells from the tissue are then tested for Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes. Read more about CVS. Amniocentesis Amniocentesis is done from around week 15 of pregnancy. A fine needle is passed through the mother's abdomen into the uterus to collect a small sample of the fluid surrounding the baby. The fluid contains cells from the baby, which are tested for Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes. Read more about amniocentesis. If you find out your unborn baby has Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndrome A small number of women who have a diagnostic test will find out their baby has Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndrome. They then have two options. Some women decide to continue with the pregnancy and prepare for their child with the condition; others decide they do not want to continue with the pregnancy and have a termination (abortion). If you are faced with this choice, you will get support from health professionals to help you make your decision. You can get more information from the charity Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC), which runs a helpline (Mon-Fri) on 0845 077 2290 or 020 7137 7486 from a mobile. The Down's Syndrome Association also has useful information on screening, and the UK National Screening Committee has produced a booklet called Screening tests for you and your baby. The charity SOFT UK offers information and support through diagnosis, bereavement, pregnancy decisions and caring for all UK families affected by Edwards' syndrome (T18) or Patau's syndrome (T13).  Page last reviewed: 09\/02\/2015 Next review due: 09\/02\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

In some cases, so-called 'date rape drugs' may be used to spike a drink before a sexual assault. Many more incidents happen abroad or go unreported due to embarrassment or memory loss. Read on or go straight to: Tips on avoiding drink spiking What to do if you think your drink has been spiked What to do if you've been sexually assaulted following drink spiking Is drink spiking illegal? Who is at risk from spiked drinks? Drink spiking can occur anywhere that drinks are available, including pubs, nightclubs, house parties, restaurants and at home.   It\u2019s not only women who are targeted. In 2012, Essex Police reported that 11% of drink spiking incidents involved men. Drink spiking may be done with the intent of stealing from the victim, assaulting the victim or as a prank. Whatever the reason, drink spiking is illegal and can result in a maximum of 10 years in prison for anyone who is found guilty. If an assault, rape or robbery has also taken place, the sentence will be even higher. Sexual assault is an act that is carried out without the victim\u2019s active consent. This means they didn\u2019t agree to it, even if they have taken drugs or alcohol voluntarily. Read more about rape and sexual assault. What substances are used to spike drinks? Alcohol is the most common substance used to spike drinks. It can be added to a soft (non-alcoholic) drink without you knowing, or double measures can be used instead of singles. Drugs used in drink spiking are often referred to as \"date rape drugs\", although they are not always used for sexual assault. Some examples of drugs that have reportedly been used for drink spiking include: gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) tranquillisers, most often benzodiazepines, including Valium (diazepam) and Rohypnol ketamine Date rape drugs are particularly dangerous when mixed with alcohol, because they combine to have a very powerful anaesthetic effect. In extreme cases, it can lead to a coma or even death. Date rape drugs may come in powder, tablet or liquid form, and don\u2019t always have an unusual taste or smell. See the A-Z of drugs on the Talk to Frank website for more information about illegal substances and their effects. How do I know if my drink has been spiked? Most date rape drugs take effect within 15-30 minutes and symptoms usually last for several hours. However, if you pass out it will be hard to know the full effect. You may still feel some of the symptoms of a date rape drug after a night\u2019s sleep. Although your symptoms will depend on which substance has been used, they usually include some of the following: lowered inhibitions difficulty concentrating or speaking loss of balance and finding it hard to move visual problems, particularly blurred vision memory loss (amnesia) or \"blackouts\" feeling confused or disorientated, particularly after waking up (if you've been asleep) paranoia (a feeling of fear or distrust of others) hallucinations (seeing, hearing or touching things that aren't there) or having an \"out of body\" experience nausea and vomiting unconsciousness How to avoid drink spiking If your drink has been spiked, it's unlikely that you will see, smell or taste any difference. Some drugs, such as GHB, may taste slightly salty or smell unusual. If you start to feel strange or more drunk than you should be, get help immediately. Binge drinking, where you drink lots of alcohol in a short space of time, can increase the risk of having your drink spiked or being the victim of a sexual assault.  Try to avoid drinking too much alcohol, especially in unfamiliar situations. You could lose control, make risky decisions and become less aware of danger. The following steps may also help prevent drink spiking: Never leave your drink unattended and keep an eye on your friends' drinks. Don't accept a drink from someone you don't know. Consider sticking to bottled drinks and avoiding punch bowls or jugs of cocktails. Don't give out your address to someone you've just met. If you think your drink has been tampered with, don't drink it \u2013 tell a trusted friend or relative immediately. Before going out, let someone know where you're going and what time you expect to be home. Make plans for your journey home. Avoid taking expensive equipment with you or anything that could be a target for thieves. If you are travelling abroad, be aware of the local area and where you can find help. Some bars provide plastic stopper devices, such as lids to put on bottles, which can reduce the risk of your drink being spiked. However, these stoppers won't stop you consuming a drink that has been spiked with additional alcohol. They may also provide kits to test your drink, but these don\u2019t test for every kind of drug and often don't work. What should I do if I think my drink has been spiked? First, tell someone you completely trust, such as: a close friend a relative a medical professional the police If you aren't with anyone, call someone you trust and get to a safe place. Ask to use a phone if yours has been stolen. If you need urgent help, call 999. Be wary of accepting help from a stranger and don\u2019t leave with someone you don\u2019t know. If you feel unwell, someone you trust should take you to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Tell the medical staff that you think your drink has been spiked.  Arrange for a trusted friend or relative to take you home and stay with you until the drugs have fully left your system. Report it to the police as soon as you can. They may ask you to provide blood and urine samples. Most drugs leave the body within 72 hours of being taken (the date rape drug GHB leaves the body within 12 hours), so it's important to be tested as soon as possible. If you are abroad, get help from a travel representative, local medical services or ask a bar or hotel manager to call local police. You can also find contact details for the British Embassy, High Commission or Consulate on GOV.UK. Physical assault and robbery following a spiked drink If you have been physically assaulted, robbed, or both, you should report this to the police. They will want any information you have about your attackers, such as: if you knew them what they looked like the circumstances that led to the attack what happened during the attack what was taken The police will need to keep a record of your injuries, and you may need to receive medical treatment. If you've been sexually assaulted following drink spiking Find your nearest sexual assault referral centre If you have been sexually assaulted, you should get medical attention as soon as possible. You may need tests to determine whether you have any sexually transmitted infections (STIs), or whether you are pregnant. You don't have to report an attack to the police immediately if you don't want to. You can contact any of the following places for advice, treatment or referral to a specialist service (such as a forensic examination): a sexual assault referral centre; find your nearest sexual assault referral centre a doctor or practice nurse at your GP surgery a voluntary organisation, such as Rape Crisis the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre national freephone helpline on 0808 802 9999 (12-2.30pm and 7-9.30pm every day of the year) a hospital accident and emergency (A&E) department a genitourinary medicine (GUM) or sexual health clinic a contraceptive clinic a young people\u2019s service NHS 111 Any forensic evidence that is obtained during tests can be stored while you decide whether to report the attack to the police.

If used in this way, they can cause serious side effects and addiction.  Anabolic steroids are manufactured drugs that mimic the effects of the male hormone testosterone. They have limited medical uses and aren't to be confused with corticosteroids, a different type of steroid drug that's commonly prescribed for a variety of conditions. This page explains the dangers of misusing anabolic steroids, and aims to advise and support those who are addicted to the drugs. It covers: anabolic steroids and the law why people misuse anabolic steroids how they are taken side effects addiction getting help Are anabolic steroids illegal? Anabolic steroids are class C drugs, which can only be sold by pharmacists with a prescription. It's not illegal to possess anabolic steroids for personal use. They can also be imported or exported, as long as this is carried out in person. This means they can't be posted or delivered by a courier or freight service. However, it's illegal to possess, import or export anabolic steroids if it's believed you're supplying or selling them. This includes giving them to friends. The penalty is an unlimited fine, or even a prison sentence. In professional sport, most organisations ban anabolic steroid use and test competitors for banned steroids. Why people misuse anabolic steroids Anabolic steroids are performance-enhancing drugs that increase muscle mass and decrease fat, as well as causing many undesirable effects. Some athletes, weightlifters and bodybuilders take them regularly to improve their physical performance and build up their bodies. However, people of all ages have been known to misuse these drugs, including adolescent boys who suffer from body dysmorphia, an anxiety disorder where the way someone thinks about their body doesn't match the way it looks. Teenage boys and young men may take the drugs because they have reverse anorexia. This is when they don't see themselves as being physically big enough or strong enough. Some people believe taking anabolic steroids will help them become fit and healthy. This isn't true: taking anabolic steroids is a dangerous drug habit. How anabolic steroids are taken Anabolic steroids are usually injected into the muscle, but some are available in tablet form, or as creams or gels that are applied to the skin. Most people who use anabolic steroids are aware of the dangers of taking them, and have ways of getting the desired effect without the undesirable side effects. This involves injecting the drugs for a period of time and then stopping for a rest period before starting again. This is known as \"cycling\". More than one type of anabolic steroid may be used at a time. Users believe this increases the effectiveness, and is known as \"stacking\". The term \"pyramiding\" refers to a combination of both stacking and cycling. One or more anabolic steroid is taken in a low dose. This is gradually increased to a maximum dose over 6 to 12 weeks, before the dose is reduced to zero to give the body a break and the cycle is started again. Users tend to exercise more when they're taking high doses to make the most of their improved performance during this time. Athletes have been known to try to time their injections so the drug is out of their system by the time they're drug tested. Side effects of anabolic steroids Regularly taking anabolic steroids causes a range of male features, not just increased muscle mass. It can also lead to potentially dangerous medical conditions, such as high blood pressure (hypertension) or heart attacks. Physical effects Effects of anabolic steroids in men can include: reduced sperm count infertility shrunken testicles erectile dysfunction baldness breast development increased risk of developing prostate cancer severe acne stomach pain In women, anabolic steroids can cause: facial hair growth and body hair loss of breasts swelling of the clitoris  a deepened voice an increased sex drive problems with periods hair loss severe acne In addition, both men and women who take anabolic steroids can develop any of the following medical conditions: heart attack or stroke liver or kidney tumours high blood pressure (hypertension)  blood clots  fluid retention high cholesterol   Psychological effects Misusing anabolic steroids can also cause the following psychological or emotional effects: aggressive behaviour  mood swings manic behaviour hallucinations and delusions Stunted growth in adolescents Anabolic steroids accelerate bone growth, so if they're misused by adolescents who haven't yet had the growth spurt associated with puberty, the drugs can cause premature ageing of the bones and restricted growth. Sharing needles As anabolic steroids are often injected, there are risks associated with sharing needles. These are the same risks associated with recreational drug use, and include: damage to veins, leading to ulcers or gangrene hepatitis B infection hepatitis C infection HIV transmission Addiction Like many other substances, anabolic steroids are addictive. This means you can crave the drug, require more to get the same effect, and have withdrawal symptoms if you suddenly stop taking them. A person who is addicted to anabolic steroids will continue using them despite experiencing unpleasant physical side effects. When doctors prescribe steroid medication, they always advise coming off the medication slowly by gradually reducing the dose. Coming off anabolic steroids suddenly can result in withdrawal symptoms that include: depression and apathy feelings of anxiety difficulty concentrating insomnia  anorexia  decreased sex drive extreme tiredness (fatigue) headaches  muscle and joint pain Getting help  You should see your GP if you think you're addicted to anabolic steroids. Treatment for an addiction to anabolic steroids will be similar to that of other types of addiction. Your GP may refer you to a specially trained drugs counsellor. They'll discuss your addiction with you, how to safely stop taking steroids, and any obstacles you may face when trying to stop, plus strategies for dealing with those obstacles.

This guide to getting treatment for a drug problem will steer you through the options, so you can find help that works for you. If you have a problem with drugs, you have the same entitlement to care as anyone coming to the NHS for help with any other health problem. With the right help and support, it's possible for you to get drug free and stay that way. Where to get help for drugs A good place to start is to visit your GP. Your GP can discuss your concerns with you, assess the nature of your problems, and help you choose the most appropriate treatment. They might offer to treat you or refer you to your local specialist drug service. Many drug treatment services accept self-referrals, so if you're not comfortable talking to your GP, you might be able to approach your local drug treatment service directly. You can find information about local drug treatment services on the Frank website. If you're having trouble finding the right sort of help, call the Frank drugs helpline on 0300 123 6600. An adviser can talk to you about the different options. Your drugs keyworker If you are seen at your local drug treatment service, you will first be assessed. If you are deemed appropriate for treatment, you will then be allocated a keyworker. Your keyworker may be a doctor, nurse or drugs worker. Your keyworker will help you organise the treatment you need and develop a personalised care plan with you, and will be your first point of call throughout your treatment. You'll see your keyworker for regular one-to-one sessions during your treatment. Charity and private drugs treatment Outside the NHS, there are many voluntary sector and private drug and alcohol treatment organisations that can help you. As well as providing residential rehab centres, voluntary organisations also offer various community services. These include structured day programmes, outreach and harm reduction services, counselling services, aftercare, and housing support services. These organisations will usually be linked to NHS services in your area.  Further information on drugs treatment For more specific information about treatments, read: cocaine: get help heroin: get help Page last reviewed: 08\/10\/2014 Next review due: 08\/10\/2017 More articles on: Drugs Share: Save: Subscribe:  Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Getting help Find out where to get advice and what will happen if you have treatment: General help Cocaine, crack and other stimulants Heroin and other opiates New psychoactive substances (NPS) (also called 'legal highs') What are NPS? NPS, such as mephedrone (meow meow) and spice, used to be available to buy legally in \"head shops\" (shops that sell drug paraphernalia) or online. Since the Psychoactive Substances Act came into effect on May 26 2016 it has been illegal to supply any NPS in the UK for human consumption. This includes selling them or giving them away for free. Alcohol, medicines, nicotine, caffeine and poppers (alkyl nitrites) are exempt from the act. How do NPS make you feel? The main effects of almost all psychoactive drugs, including NPS, fall into three categories: stimulants \"downers\" or sedatives psychedelics or hallucinogens Synthetic cannabinoids, which can have both sedative and psychedelic effects, are sometimes separated out into their own category. They have been a big part of the NPS market and have been particularly problematic and harmful. Even NPS that look similar or have similar names can vary in strength and can have different effects on different people. How do NPS affect your health? For lots of NPS, there has been little or no research into the short- or long-term health risks from human consumption and some risks aren't yet known. Forensic testing of NPS has shown that they often contain different substances to what the packaging says, or mixtures of different substances. This means you can never be sure what you are taking or what the effects might be. Risks include: NPS can reduce your inhibitions, so you may do potentially harmful things you wouldn't normally do. They can cause paranoia, coma, seizures and, in rare cases, death. You can never be sure of what is in an NPS, so you can't be sure what you've bought or been given, or what effect it's likely to have on you or your friends.  For more information about NPS visit the FRANK website. Cannabis (hash, weed, grass, skunk, marijuana) What is cannabis? Cannabis is a calming drug that also alters perceptions. It's seen as \"natural\" because it's made from the cannabis plant, but that doesn't mean it's safe. It can be smoked, often with tobacco, in a \"joint\" or \"spliff\", or in a pipe or \"bong\". It can also be drunk as a \"tea\" or eaten when mixed with food, such as biscuits or cakes. How does cannabis make you feel? Cannabis can make you feel relaxed and happy, but sometimes makes people feel lethargic, very anxious and paranoid, and even psychotic. How does cannabis affect your health? Cannabis has been linked to mental health problems such as schizophrenia and, when smoked, to lung diseases including asthma.  It affects how your brain works, so regular use can make concentration and learning very difficult. Frequent use can have a negative effect on your fertility. It is also dangerous to drive after taking cannabis. Mixing it with tobacco is likely to increase the risk of heart disease and lung cancer. Can cannabis be addictive? Yes, it is possible to become psychologically dependent on cannabis. And some people do experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking it. For information about coming off drugs, read Drug addiction: getting help. You can also get help cutting down from the FRANK website. Cocaine (powder cocaine, coke, crack) What is cocaine? Powder cocaine (coke), freebase and crack are all types of cocaine, and all are powerful stimulants. Freebase and crack can be smoked, and powder cocaine can be snorted in lines. Both cocaine powder and crack can also be prepared for injecting. How does cocaine make you feel? Cocaine gives the user energy, a feeling of happiness and being wide awake, and an overconfidence that can lead to taking risks. The effects are short-lived, so more drug is taken, which is often followed by a nasty \"comedown\" that makes you feel depressed and unwell, sometimes for several days. How does cocaine affect your health? If you take cocaine, it's possible to die of an overdose from overstimulating the heart and nervous system, which can lead to a heart attack. It can be more risky if mixed with alcohol. Taking cocaine is particularly risky if you have high blood pressure or already have a heart condition. If you're pregnant, cocaine can harm your baby and even cause miscarriage. If you've had previous mental health problems, it can increase the chance of these returning. If you snort cocaine, it can damage the cartilage of your nose over time. If you inject it, you are at higher risk of dying as the result of an overdose, and your veins and body tissues can be seriously damaged. You put yourself at risk of catching HIV or hepatitis if you share needles. Can cocaine be addictive? Yes, cocaine is highly addictive and can cause a very strong psychological dependence. For advice on getting help for cocaine addiction, go to Cocaine: get help. The Cocaine Anonymous website also offers further advice. Ecstasy (MDMA, pills, crystal, E) What is ecstasy? Ecstasy is a \"psychedelic\" stimulant drug usually sold as tablets, but it's sometimes dabbed on to gums or snorted in its powder form. It's also known as MDMA or \"crystal\". How does ecstasy make you feel? Ecstasy can make you feel alert, affectionate and chatty, and can make music and colours seem more intense. Taking ecstasy can also cause anxiety, confusion, paranoia and even psychosis. How does ecstasy affect your health? Long-term use has been linked with memory problems, depression and anxiety. Ecstasy use affects the body's temperature control and can lead to dangerous overheating and dehydration. But a balance is important as drinking too much fluid can also be very dangerous for the brain, particularly because ecstasy tends to stop your body producing enough urine, so your body retains the fluid. For more information on ecstasy, visit the FRANK website. Is ecstasy addictive? Ecstasy can be addictive, as users can develop a psychological dependence on this drug. It is also possible to build up a tolerance to the drug and need to take more and more to get the same effect. Speed (amphetamine, billy, whizz) What is speed? Speed is the street name for drugs based on amphetamine, and is a stimulant drug. It's usually an off-white or pink powder that's either dabbed on to gums, snorted or swallowed in paper. How does speed make you feel? Speed can make you feel alert, confident and full of energy, and can reduce appetite. But it can make you agitated and aggressive, and can cause confusion, paranoia and even psychosis. You can also become very depressed and lethargic for hours or days after a period of heavy use.   How does speed affect your health? Taking speed can be dangerous for the heart, as it can cause high blood pressure and heart attacks. It can be more risky if mixed with alcohol, or if it's used by people who have blood pressure or heart problems. Injecting speed is particularly dangerous, as death can occur from overdose. Speed is usually very impure and injecting it can cause damage to veins and tissues, which can also lead to serious infections in the body and bloodstream. Any sharing of injecting equipment adds the risk of catching hepatitis C and HIV.  Is speed addictive? Regular use of amphetamines can become highly addictive.

This leads to the eyes drying out and becoming red, swollen and irritated. Dry eye syndrome is also known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or simply \"dry eyes\". Symptoms of dry eye syndrome The symptoms of dry eye syndrome are mild for most people, although more severe cases can be painful and lead to complications. Symptoms usually affect both eyes and often include: feelings of dryness, grittiness or soreness that get worse throughout the day burning and red eyes eyelids that stick together when you wake up temporarily blurred vision, which usually improves when you blink Some people may also have episodes of watering eyes, which can occur if the eye tries to relieve the irritation by producing more tears. When to seek medical advice See your high-street optician (optometrist) if you have persistent but mild symptoms of dry eye syndrome. They can examine you to check if the problem is caused by an underlying condition, or they may refer you to an eye specialist. Contact your optometrist or GP immediately if you have any severe symptoms. If this isn't possible, visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. What causes dry eye syndrome? Dry eye syndrome can occur when the complex tear production process is disrupted in some way. There are many different reasons why this can happen, although a single identifiable cause often can't be found. Common causes include: being in a hot or windy climate wearing contact lenses certain underlying medical conditions, such as blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids) side effects of certain medications \u2013 including antihistamines, antidepressants, beta-blockers and diuretics hormonal changes in women \u2013 such as during the menopause, pregnancy, or while using the contraceptive pill Although the condition may affect people of any age, your chances of developing dry eye syndrome increase as you grow older. It's estimated up to one in every three people over the age of 65 experiences problems with dry eyes. Dry eye syndrome is more common in women than men. Read more about the causes of dry eye syndrome. How dry eye syndrome is treated Dry eye syndrome isn't usually a serious condition. Treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms, which include: eye drops to lubricate the eyes medications to reduce any inflammation if necessary, surgery to prevent tears from draining away easily If dry eye syndrome is caused by an underlying condition, treating this condition usually helps to relieve the symptoms. Read more about treating dry eye syndrome. Caring for your eyes As well as medical treatments, there are some things you can do yourself to help prevent dry eye syndrome or reduce the symptoms. These include: keeping your eyes and eyelids clean and protecting them from dusty, smoky, windy and dry environments using your computer or laptop correctly to avoid eye strain using a humidifier to moisten the air eating a healthy diet that includes omega-3 and omega-7 fats Read more self-help tips for dry eye syndrome. Further problems Although dry eye syndrome may be uncomfortable, it doesn't usually cause any serious problems. The two main complications associated with dry eye syndrome are: conjunctivitis \u2013 inflammation of the conjunctiva, the transparent layer of cells that covers the white part of the eyeball and the inner surfaces of the eyelids; most cases are mild and don't need specific treatment inflammation of the cornea \u2013 in rare cases, severe untreated dry eye syndrome can damage the surface of the cornea (keratitis); this damage can make the cornea vulnerable to ulceration and infection, which could potentially threaten your sight Contact your optometrist or GP, or visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately if you have any of the following symptoms, as they could be a sign of a more serious condition: extreme sensitivity to light (photophobia) very painful or red eyes a deterioration in your vision Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 17\/03\/2016 Next review due: 17\/03\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

A lip balm containing petroleum or beeswax will provide a barrier and help seal in moisture. More moisture is lost through the lips than through any other part of the face or body. When the lips lose moisture, the skin covering them can become tight and start to split. What not to do It's very tempting to pick and bite off flakes of dried skin, but this will only make your lips bleed and heal more slowly. Irritating the skin around your mouth may also trigger a cold sore if you're prone to getting them. It's also tempting to keep licking dry or cracked lips. But this will only dry your lips more, as the saliva evaporates and the repeated licking or wetting \"washes\" the natural grease off the skin. How to treat dry or sore lips The best thing to do if you have dry or sore lips is to regularly apply a lip balm containing petroleum or beeswax. You may need to try a few different products before you find one that works for you. For example, you may be sensitive to fragranced products, in which case non-fragranced lip balms are available. If you're going to be spending time outdoors in the sun, choose a lip balm with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 to help protect your lips. Lip balm acts as a shield to protect your lips against the sun, wind and cold or dry air. It will trap moisture and seal cracks against infection. Avoid lip balms in pots \u2013 repeatedly dipping your finger into the balm can introduce germs. Covering your lips with a scarf when you're outside during the winter can also help prevent dry lips. When dry lips become inflamed Sometimes dry lips can become inflamed and feel sore. The medical term for inflamed lips is cheilitis. Lips usually become inflamed as a result of mild irritation. They can also become inflamed if they're infected with bacteria or fungi that have entered cracks in the skin of the lips. If the corners of your mouth are red and sore, you may have a type of inflammation called angular cheilitis. This is often caused by bacteria or fungi and is treated with ointments applied to the area. Angular cheilitis can sometimes be a symptom of a type of eczema called contact dermatitis, and is more common in people who wear dentures. It's also more common in older people \u2013 with age, the creases around the corners of the mouth become more pronounced, and saliva can build up in the crevices and irritate the skin. When to see your GP See your GP if your lips are red and sore and you think they're infected. They may prescribe an antibiotic or antifungal cream to treat the infection. This may also contain 1% hydrocortisone (steroid medication) to reduce the inflammation. If you have a non-healing persistent sore, this should be seen by your GP as soon as possible.

You should see your dentist or GP if you have an unusually dry mouth (known as xerostomia) so they can try to determine the cause. What can cause a dry mouth? A dry mouth can occur when the salivary glands in your mouth don't produce enough saliva. This is often the result of dehydration, which means you don\u2019t have enough fluid in your body to produce the saliva you need. It's also common for your mouth to become dry if you're feeling anxious or nervous. A dry mouth can sometimes be caused by an underlying problem or medical condition, such as: medication \u2013 many different medications can cause a dry mouth, including antidepressants, antihistamines and diuretics; check the leaflet that comes with your medicine, or find it in the Medicines A-Z to see if dry mouth is listed as a side effect a blocked nose \u2013 breathing through your mouth while you sleep can cause it to dry out diabetes \u2013 a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high radiotherapy to the head and neck \u2013 this can cause the salivary glands to become inflamed (mucositis) Sjögren's syndrome \u2013 a condition where the immune system attacks and damages the salivary glands If you see your dentist or GP, let them know about any other symptoms you're experiencing and any treatments you\u2019re having, as this will help them work out why your mouth is dry. What problems can a dry mouth cause? Saliva plays an important role in keeping your mouth healthy. If you have a dry mouth, you may experience a number of other problems too, such as: a burning sensation or soreness in your mouth dry lips bad breath (halitosis) a decreased or altered sense of taste recurrent mouth infections, such as oral thrush tooth decay and gum disease difficulty speaking, eating or swallowing It\u2019s important to maintain good oral hygiene if you have a dry mouth to reduce the risk of dental problems. You should also see a dentist regularly, so they can identify and treat any problems early on. Treating a dry mouth Treating the underlying cause If your doctor or dentist is able to determine what's causing your dry mouth, treating this may improve your symptoms. For example, if medication is suspected as the cause of your dry mouth, your doctor may reduce your dose or suggest trying an alternative medication. Some of the conditions mentioned above have specific treatments, such as nasal decongestants for a blocked nose and insulin for diabetes. Things to try yourself There are simple measures you can try to help keep your mouth moist. For example, it may help to: increase your fluid intake \u2013 take regular sips of cold water or an unsweetened drink suck on sugar-free sweets or chew sugar-free gum \u2013 this can stimulate your salivary glands to produce more saliva suck on ice cubes \u2013 the ice will melt slowly and moisten your mouth avoid alcohol (including alcohol-based mouthwashes), caffeine and smoking \u2013 these can all make a dry mouth worse Saliva substitutes and stimulants If the measures above don\u2019t help, your dentist, GP or specialist may suggest using an artificial saliva substitute to keep your mouth moist. This may come in the form of a spray, gel or lozenge. Use it as often as you need to, including before and during meals. If your dry mouth is caused by radiotherapy or Sjögren's syndrome, a medication called pilocarpine may be prescribed. This is taken as a tablet several times a day to help stimulate your salivary glands to produce more saliva.

It can be a problem at any age, but is a particular issue for women who are going through or have experienced the menopause. Don't ignore a dry vagina or feel embarrassed to seek help if it's a problem for you. There are a number of treatments that can help. This page covers: Symptoms Causes What to do Treatments Symptoms of a dry vagina Some women only have symptoms of vaginal dryness at certain times, such as during sex, while others have them all the time. Problems associated with having a dry vagina include: vaginal irritation, discomfort, itchiness or a burning sensation discomfort during sex a reduced sex drive difficulty getting aroused and reaching orgasm the surface of the vagina looks pale and thin narrowing or shortening of the vagina needing to pee more often than usual repeated urinary tract infections (UTIs) Causes of vaginal dryness Causes of a dry vagina include: the menopause \u2013 decreased levels of the hormone oestrogen during the menopause can cause persistent vaginal dryness (also known as vaginal atrophy or atrophic vaginitis) breastfeeding or childbirth \u2013 oestrogen levels can temporarily decrease after giving birth and make your vagina feel drier than usual not being aroused before sex \u2013 if you don't feel aroused before having sex, your vagina may not produce natural lubricant and sex may be uncomfortable some types of contraception \u2013 the combined contraceptive pill and contraceptive injection can occasionally cause vaginal dryness, although this is uncommon cancer treatment \u2013 radiotherapy to the pelvic area, hormonal cancer treatments, and sometimes chemotherapy can cause vaginal dryness Vaginal dryness is also sometimes caused by an underlying condition such as diabetes or Sjögren's syndrome, where the immune attacks the glands in the body that produce fluid. What to do if you have a dry vagina If you're having problems with vaginal dryness, it's worth trying self-help options first. It can help to: try using a lubricant or vaginal moisturiser \u2013 these can be bought without a prescription give yourself enough time to become aroused before having sex \u2013 read more about female arousal and get good sex tips It's a good idea to see your GP for advice if: self-help measures aren't effective your symptoms are particularly severe and are interfering with your normal activities you have other troublesome symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats Don't feel embarrassed about seeking help. Vaginal dryness is a common problem that GPs see frequently. Treatments for vaginal dryness The main treatments that can help if you have a dry vagina are: Lubricants Vaginal moisturisers Vaginal oestrogen Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) Lubricants Lubricants are liquids or gels that you apply to your vulva, vagina or your partner's penis just before having sex to keep your vagina moist. They offer immediate but short-term relief from vaginal dryness. Several different brands of lubricant are available to buy from shops and pharmacies without a prescription. You may need to experiment with a few different types to find one that works best for you. Vaginal moisturisers Vaginal moisturisers are creams that you apply inside your vagina to keep it moist. They may be better than lubricants if the dryness isn't just causing problems during sex, as they tend to have a longer-lasting effect. They usually need to be applied every few days. As with lubricants, several different brands are available to buy. You may need to experiment with a few different types to find one that works best for you. Water-based moisturisers are generally best, as oil or petroleum-based products can damage latex condoms and sometimes irritate the vagina.    Vaginal oestrogen Your GP may prescribe vaginal oestrogen if your dryness is caused by the menopause. This works by increasing the level of oestrogen that declines during and after the menopause. Vaginal oestrogen is available as pills you place in your vagina (pessaries), vaginal creams and vaginal rings. These all work equally well, but you may find one type more convenient to use. Oestrogen treatment can be more effective than lubricants and moisturisers for menopausal women, and it generally causes few side effects. However, it can take a few weeks to start working, so you may want to use a lubricant or moisturiser as well to begin with. Treatment usually needs to be continued indefinitely, as the dryness tends to return if treatment stops. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) HRT is a treatment that involves taking medication to replace the hormones that start to decline during the menopause. It's available on prescription from your GP either as tablets, a skin patch, an implant under the skin, or a gel that's applied to the skin. HRT has a wider effect on the body than vaginal oestrogen, so may be best if you have other menopause symptoms, such as hot flushes. However, it also has more side effects.

The 4-in-1 pre-school booster vaccine increases their immunity even further. When should children have the 4-in-1 booster vaccine? The 4-in-1 booster vaccine is routinely offered to children at the age of three years and four months old.   How is the 4-in-1 vaccine given? It's injected into the child's upper arm. Can the 4-in-1 pre-school booster vaccine be given with other vaccines? The pre-school booster can be given at the same time as other vaccines. It's usually given at the same time as the second dose of the MMR vaccine. This NHS leaflet tells you more about pre-school immunisations (PDF, 835kb). How well does the 4-in-1 pre-school booster work? Studies have shown that the pre-school booster is very effective. In clinical tests, more than 99% of children who had been given the 4-in-1 pre-school booster were protected against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough and polio. The vaccine protects children from these infections until they receive their teenage 3-in-1 booster at the age of 14.  The 4-in-1 vaccine not only protects your child against these infections, but also stops them passing the germs on to babies who are too young to have had all of their vaccinations. How safe is the 4-in-1 booster vaccine? Before anyone can be given a vaccine, it has to go through many tests to check that it is safe and that it works. However, the 4-in-1 pre-school booster, like other vaccines, can have side effects in some children. Side effects of the 4-in-1 vaccine are usually mild. Your child may get a little redness, swelling or tenderness where the injection was given that will disappear on its own. This NHS leaflet tells you about common vaccination reactions in young children up to five years of age (PDF, 118kb). There are two different 4-in-1 vaccines that are used in the UK \u2013 Infanrix IPV and REPEVAX. Both vaccines provide good booster responses, so it doesn't matter which one your child is given as their pre-school booster.  Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for Infanrix IPV (PDF, 68kb). Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for REPEVAX (PDF, 30kb). Read more about the 4-in-1 pre-school booster side effects. Which children can't have the 4-in-1 booster vaccine? The vast majority of children can have the 4-in-1 booster vaccine, but there are a few children who shouldn't have it. They include children who: are allergic to the vaccine have a fever at the time of the vaccination appointment The vaccine should not be given to children who have had an anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction) to any part of the vaccine before. There is no need to postpone vaccination if your child has a minor illness, such as a cough or a cold with no fever. But if your baby is ill with a fever, it's best to delay vaccination until they have recovered. Why is inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) used rather than oral polio vaccine (OPV), as in the past? Oral polio vaccine (OPV) was used from the 1960s because the live vaccine provided better community-wide protection against polio. Now that polio has been wiped out from large parts of the world, the risk of polio is so low that it is an appropriate time to switch to inactivated polio vaccine, which is given as an injection and does not carry the risk of paralytic polio. Can you get polio from the polio part of this vaccine? The 4-in-1 pre-school booster uses inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot cause polio.  Page last reviewed: 18\/05\/2016 Next review due: 18\/05\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's given as a single injection to protect your baby against five serious childhood diseases:  diphtheria  tetanus  whooping cough (pertussis)  polio  Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) When should babies have the 5-in-1 vaccine? The 5-in-1 vaccine is given three times \u2013 when babies are 8, 12 and 16 weeks old. Your baby needs three doses to make sure they develop strong immunity against the five diseases the vaccine protects against. Every time another dose of the vaccine is given, your baby's immune response increases. How is the 5-in-1 vaccine given? The vaccine is injected into your baby's thigh. How well does the 5-in-1 vaccine work? The 5-in-1 vaccine works well. It produces very good immunity to diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Hib and polio infections. How safe is the 5-in-1 vaccine? The 5-in-1 vaccine is very safe. It's inactivated, which means it doesn't contain any live organisms, so there is no risk of your baby getting the diseases it protects against. The vaccine also has few side effects, although it's common for babies to be a little irritable afterwards. They may also have a short-lived small bump, redness and swelling at the injection site.  There are two 5-in-1 vaccines that are used in the UK. Either can be given to babies as part of the childhood vaccination programme. Their brand names are Pediacel and Infanrix IPV Hib. Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for Pediacel (PDF, 37.43kb). Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for Infanrix IPV Hib (PDF, 66.7kb). Read more about 5-in-1 vaccine side effects. Can the 5-in-1 be given at the same time as other vaccines? It's safe for your baby to have the 5-in-1 vaccine at the same time as other vaccines, such as the rotavirus vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine and Men B vaccine. Which babies should not have the 5-in-1 infant vaccine? The vast majority of babies can have the 5-in-1 jab, but there are a few babies who should not have it. They include babies who: are allergic to the vaccine have a fever at the time of the vaccination appointment  have signs of a neurological problem that is getting worse, including poorly controlled epilepsy The vaccine should not be given to babies who have had an anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction) to a previous dose of the vaccine, or a reaction to any part of the vaccine that may be present in trace amounts, such as neomycin, streptomycin or polymixin B. There is no need to postpone vaccination if your baby has a minor illness, such as a cough or a cold with no fever. But if your baby is ill with a fever, it's best to delay vaccination until they have recovered. Children who show signs of a neurological problem that is getting worse, including poorly controlled epilepsy, should have their vaccination postponed until they have been seen by a specialist. If your child has a history of febrile convulsions (fits) or has suffered a fit within 72 hours of a previous dose of the vaccine, speak to your GP, nurse or health visitor. They will advise you about what to do. What if I miss the 5-in-1 vaccination appointment? It's best for babies to be vaccinated at the recommended age, as they are then protected from serious diseases as early in life as possible. However, don't worry if your baby has missed an appointment for the 5-in-1 vaccination. It's never too late to have it. Make an appointment with your GP surgery or local child health clinic.

Some of the main causes of nipple discharge are described below. See your GP if you're unsure of the cause of your discharge or you're embarrassed or worried, especially if the discharge is bloodstained or clear and only comes from one nipple, or if you're a man with nipple discharge. Pregnancy For women, one of the most obvious explanations for fluid leaking from the nipple is that you're pregnant or currently breastfeeding, as this can cause a milky discharge to come from both nipples. In pregnancy, the breasts may start to produce milk from as early as the second trimester, and some women continue to produce milk up to two years after stopping breastfeeding. If you think you may be pregnant, you can do a pregnancy test. You may also find the article Am I pregnant? helpful. Non-pregnancy causes If pregnancy has been ruled out, it's likely that your nipple discharge is caused by one of the following conditions: duct papilloma \u2013 a harmless growth inside your breast duct (the tube that carries milk from the gland to the nipple) that typically causes bloodstained discharge from one breast duct ectasia \u2013 a harmless, age-related breast change that can result in a cheesy or discoloured discharge from both breasts  breast or nipple abscess \u2013 a painful collection of pus forming in the breast tissue or around the nipple, usually as a result of bacterial infection These conditions are explained in more detail below, to give you a better idea of whether you may be affected. However, it's important to see your GP for a proper diagnosis so a more serious cause such as breast cancer can be ruled out. Duct papilloma If the discharge is bloodstained and from a single breast, the cause is likely to be a duct papilloma. A papilloma is a harmless wart-like growth, usually about 1-2cm in size, found inside one of the breast ducts. The papilloma is usually just behind the nipple and can cause fluid or blood to seep out of the nipple.  You'll usually just have one papilloma, and a simple procedure to remove it will often be recommended. Although the discharge may be alarming, rest assured that papilloma is not cancer and is very unlikely to turn into cancer. Duct ectasia If the discharge is brown, green or cheesy, it's likely you have a harmless condition called duct ectasia. Duct ectasia tends to affect women approaching the menopause. As the breasts age, the milk ducts behind the nipple get shorter and wider, and may produce a discharge. This is a normal, age-related change and nothing to worry about. A lump can sometimes be felt behind the nipple, which is just scar tissue or perhaps a dilated duct, and the nipple sometimes becomes inverted. This condition is harmless and tends to clear up without treatment. It doesn't increase your risk of developing breast cancer in the future. However, it's important to go back to your GP if you develop any new symptoms. An abscess If the discharge contains pus, the cause will probably be a breast abscess or abscess around the nipple. The surrounding skin will be red, warm and swollen. Breast abscesses are often linked to mastitis \u2013 a condition that causes breast pain and swelling (inflammation) and usually affects women who are breastfeeding. If you have been to see your GP because of mastitis, you may already have been given antibiotics. If your breast is still hard, red and painful, your GP should refer you to a specialist to check for a breast abscess. If the diagnosis is confirmed, a simple procedure to drain the abscess may be recommended. Read more about treating breast abscesses. More unusual causes Less common causes of nipple discharge are: the contraceptive pill \u2013 discharge can be a temporary side effect of starting the pill (some women also get breast tenderness and breast enlargement) fluctuating hormones from puberty or the menopause previous breastfeeding \u2013 some women continue to produce milk up to two years after they've stopped breastfeeding   stimulation of the nipples \u2013 for example, through sex medication that causes raised levels of the milk-producing hormone prolactin \u2013 this includes SSRI antidepressants and tranquillisers a type of non-cancerous brain tumour called a prolactinoma, which causes raised levels of prolactin a hormone problem \u2013 such as an underactive thyroid gland or Cushing's syndrome a clogged milk duct called a galactocele \u2013 which is usually associated with childbirth and can cause a milky or creamy discharge along with a painless lump an early form of breast cancer called carcinoma in situ, which is found inside the milk ducts and hasn't yet spread (it's usually picked up during breast cancer screening) Is it breast cancer? In the vast majority of cases, nipple discharge isn't a sign of breast cancer. However, discharge from the breast can very occasionally be a symptom of cancer, so it's not something you should ever ignore. Nipple discharge is more likely to be a symptom of cancer if: you also have a breast lump or changes to the skin of your breast the discharge is bloody and only comes from one nipple the discharge occurs without any pressure on your breast or nipple you're over 50 See your GP if you're worried you might have breast cancer. While this is unlikely, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis. Read more about the symptoms of breast cancer and how breast cancer is diagnosed.

If the diagnosis is confirmed, a simple procedure to drain the abscess may be recommended. Read more about treating breast abscesses. More unusual causes Less common causes of nipple discharge are: the contraceptive pill \u2013 discharge can be a temporary side effect of starting the pill (some women also get breast tenderness and breast enlargement) fluctuating hormones from puberty or the menopause previous breastfeeding \u2013 some women continue to produce milk up to two years after they've stopped breastfeeding   stimulation of the nipples \u2013 for example, through sex medication that causes raised levels of the milk-producing hormone prolactin \u2013 this includes SSRI antidepressants and tranquillisers a type of non-cancerous brain tumour called a prolactinoma, which causes raised levels of prolactin a hormone problem \u2013 such as an underactive thyroid gland or Cushing's syndrome a clogged milk duct called a galactocele \u2013 which is usually associated with childbirth and can cause a milky or creamy discharge along with a painless lump an early form of breast cancer called carcinoma in situ, which is found inside the milk ducts and hasn't yet spread (it's usually picked up during breast cancer screening) Is it breast cancer? In the vast majority of cases, nipple discharge isn't a sign of breast cancer. However, discharge from the breast can very occasionally be a symptom of cancer, so it's not something you should ever ignore. Nipple discharge is more likely to be a symptom of cancer if: you also have a breast lump or changes to the skin of your breast the discharge is bloody and only comes from one nipple the discharge occurs without any pressure on your breast or nipple you're over 50 See your GP if you're worried you might have breast cancer. While this is unlikely, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis. Read more about the symptoms of breast cancer and how breast cancer is diagnosed.

Problems can also occur because of changes in the way you digest food. Cancer Gastrectomies to treat stomach cancer have a higher risk of complications, because most people who have this type of surgery are elderly and often in poor health. Complications can also occur after a gastrectomy to treat oesophageal cancer. The oesophagus is the tube connecting your throat to your stomach. Possible complications of a gastrectomy include: wound infection leaking from where the stomach has been closed or reattached to the small intestine stricture \u2013 where stomach acid leaks up into your oesophagus and over time causes scarring, leading to the oesophagus becoming narrow and constricted chest infection internal bleeding blockage of the small intestine (small bowel) An infection can usually be treated with antibiotics, but some other complications will require further surgery. Before your operation, ask your surgeon to explain the possible risks and how likely they are to affect you. It's estimated that around 2 in 100 people who have a gastrectomy for cancer die from complications. Obesity Possible complications of a gastrectomy for obesity include: nausea and vomiting \u2013 which usually get better over time internal bleeding \u2013 which can lead to blood clots forming leaking from where the stomach has been closed acid reflux \u2013 where stomach acid leaks back up into the oesophagus infection It may be possible to treat some complications with medication, but others may need further surgery. Before your operation, ask your surgeon to explain the possible risks and how likely they are to affect you. The risk of death from a gastrectomy for obesity is very low, estimated as less than 1 in 100. Vitamin deficiency One function of your stomach is to absorb vitamins, particularly vitamins B12, C and D, from the food you eat. If your entire stomach has been removed, you may not get all the vitamins your body needs from your diet. This may lead to certain health conditions, such as: Anaemia  The body requires vitamin B12 to make healthy blood cells. Without enough healthy blood cells, you could develop symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness and breathlessness. Increased vulnerability to infection Vitamin C helps to strengthen your immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness). If you don't have enough vitamin C in your diet, you may develop frequent infections. Wounds or burns will also take longer to heal. Brittle bones and weakened muscles Your body needs vitamin D to keep both your bones and muscles strong and healthy. If there isn't enough vitamin D in your diet, you could develop pain and weakness in your bones (osteoporosis) and muscles. Changing your diet may help to compensate for your stomach's inability to absorb vitamins. However, even after changing your diet, you may need vitamin supplements. The healthcare professionals treating you can advise on this. Read about recovering from a gastrectomy for more information on diet and supplements. Weight loss Immediately after surgery, you may find that eating even a small meal makes you feel uncomfortably full. This could lead to weight loss. Losing weight may be desirable if you've had a gastrectomy because you're obese, but it can be a health risk if you've been treated for cancer. Some people who have a gastrectomy regain weight once they have adjusted to the effects of surgery and have changed their diet. However, if you continue to lose weight, see a dietitian (a healthcare professional who specialises in nutrition). A dietitian can give you advice on how to increase your weight without upsetting your digestive system. Dumping syndrome Dumping syndrome is a set of symptoms that can affect people after a gastrectomy. It's caused when particularly sugary or starchy food moves suddenly into your small intestine. Before a gastrectomy, your stomach digested most of the sugar and starch. However, after surgery your stomach can no longer do this, so your small intestine has to draw in water from the rest of your body to help break down the food. The amount of water that enters your small intestine can be as much as 1.5 litres (3 pints). Much of the extra water is taken from your blood, which means you will experience a sudden fall in blood pressure. The drop in blood pressure can cause symptoms such as: faintness sweating palpitations a need to lie down The extra water in your small intestine will cause symptoms such as: bloating rumbling stomach nausea indigestion diarrhoea If you have dumping syndrome, resting for 20-45 minutes after eating a meal may help. To ease the symptoms of dumping syndrome: eat slowly avoid sugary foods \u2013 such as cakes, chocolate and sweets slowly add more fibre to your diet avoid soup and other liquid foods eat smaller, more frequent meals Seek advice from your hospital team or dietitian if you have symptoms of dumping syndrome. For most people, the symptoms improve over time. Morning vomiting After a partial gastrectomy, a small number of people may experience morning vomiting. Vomiting occurs when bile (a fluid used by the digestive system to break down fats) and digestive juices build up in your duodenum overnight, before spilling back into what remains of your stomach. The duodenum is the first part of your small intestine. Due to its reduced size, your stomach is likely to feel uncomfortably full and this will trigger a vomiting reflex to get rid of the excess fluids and bile. Taking indigestion medication, such as aluminium hydroxide, may help to reduce the symptoms of morning vomiting. See your GP if your symptoms are particularly troublesome. Diarrhoea During a gastrectomy, it's sometimes necessary to cut a nerve called the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve helps to control the movement of food through your digestive system. Although the vagus nerve will heal after surgery, a small number of people will experience bouts of severe diarrhoea. However, they usually only occur now and again, and should pass within a day or so. Taking diarrhoea medication, such as loperamide, in the morning may help to reduce your symptoms.

It causes one or more fingers to bend into the palm of the hand. It can affect one or both hands, and sometimes affect the thumb. Dupuytren's contracture occurs when the connective tissue in the palm thickens. Often the tissue thickens in one small area first and a \u201Cnodule\u201D forms (a small, hard lump about 0.5-1cm) under the skin of the palm. The nodule sometimes feels tender to begin with, but this usually passes. More nodules may then develop. The nodules are non-cancerous (benign) and the condition isn't life-threatening for those who develop it, although it can be a nuisance to live with. Over time, the nodules can extend and form cords of tissue. These cords can shorten (contract) and, if the cords run along a finger or thumb, they can pull it, so it becomes bent towards the palm. These contractures are often mild and painless, but they can get steadily worse over time. Read more about the symptoms of Dupuytren's contracture and diagnosing Dupuytren's contracture. Why it happens The exact cause of Dupuytren's contracture is unknown, but it\u2019s thought to be related to your genes, as it often runs in families. If you have the gene that causes Dupuytren\u2019s contracture, other factors such as diabetes, smoking and certain medications (for example, medication for epilepsy) may activate the condition. However, it's not clear how significant these factors are. Read more about the causes of Dupuytren's contracture. Who's affected Dupuytren's contracture is fairly common. It can affect both sexes, but affects men more than women. The condition usually occurs during later life, although cases have been reported in children. Most cases occur in men over 50 and women over 60. The condition seems to be more common in people of North European descent. It's thought the gene associated with the condition was brought to the UK by the Vikings. Preventing Dupuytren's contracture As the exact cause of Dupuytren's contracture is unknown, it may not be possible to prevent the condition. However, if you're at risk of developing the condition \u2013 for example, if you've had it in the past, or if you have a family history of it \u2013 stopping smoking (if you smoke) may reduce your risk. Treating Dupuytren's contracture Many cases of Dupuytren's contracture are mild and don't need treatment. Treatment may be helpful if the condition is interfering with the normal functioning of your hand. Non-surgical treatments include radiation therapy and injections with a medication called collagenase. Alternatively, a minor procedure that involves using a needle to cut the contracted cord of tissue (needle fasciotomy) may be used in the early stages of the condition. In more severe cases, surgery can help to restore hand function. The two most common surgical techniques are: open fasciotomy \u2013 where the shortened connective tissue is cut to relieve tension fasciectomy \u2013 where the shortened connective tissue is removed Surgery for Dupuytren's contracture can't always fully straighten the affected finger or thumb, and the contracture can recur after surgery. If a contracture does recur, further surgery may be possible. Having surgery to remove the first nodule that appears won't stop the condition from progressing, as this won't stop the condition occurring elsewhere in the palm. It's usually best to avoid surgery until a contracture develops that interferes with use of the hand. Read more about treating Dupuytren's contracture and recovering from Dupuytren's contracture surgery. Ongoing research Some other treatments have been suggested for Dupuytren\u2019s contracture, but there's currently not enough medical evidence to support their use. For example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) doesn't recommend the use of vitamin E cream or ultrasonic therapy. Trials into other possible treatments are under way. Dupuytren\u2019s contracture often runs in families and genetic research hopes to identify the genes responsible for the condition. This could lead to the development of treatments that prevent contractures occurring in the first place. Information about you If you have Dupuytren\u2019s contracture, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Illustration of Dupuytren's contracture bent finger abnormal nodules in the connective tissue beneath the skin normal connective tissue Related conditions Dupuytren\u2019s contracture is related to a number of similar conditions that affect different areas of the body, including: Garrod\u2019s pads \u2013 nodules that develop on the back of the knuckles on the fingers Ledderhose\u2019s disease (plantar fibromatosis) \u2013 nodules and contractures that affect the foot Peyronie\u2019s disease \u2013 where the tissue of the penis is affected, causing it to become abnormally curved These conditions can occur on their own, but some people are affected by several of them at the same time.

DVT usually occurs in a deep leg vein, a larger vein that runs through the muscles of the calf and the thigh. It can cause pain and swelling in the leg and may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism. This is a serious condition that occurs when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream and blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs (see below). DVT and pulmonary embolism together are known as venous thromboembolism (VTE). Symptoms of DVT In some cases, there may be no symptoms of DVT. If symptoms do occur they can include: pain, swelling and tenderness in one of your legs (usually your calf) a heavy ache in the affected area warm skin in the area of the clot red skin, particularly at the back of your leg below the knee DVT usually (although not always) affects one leg. The pain may be worse when you bend your foot upward towards your knee. Pulmonary embolism If left untreated, about one in 10 people with a DVT will develop a pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary embolism is a very serious condition which causes: breathlessness \u2013 which may come on gradually or suddenly chest pain \u2013 which may become worse when you breathe in sudden collapse  Both DVT and pulmonary embolism require urgent investigation and treatment. Seek immediate medical attention if you have pain, swelling and tenderness in your leg and you develop breathlessness and chest pain. Read more about the complications of DVT. What causes DVT? Each year, DVT affects around one person in every 1,000 in the UK. Anyone can develop DVT, but it becomes more common over the age of 40. As well as age, there are also a number of other risk factors, including: having a history of DVT or pulmonary embolism having a family history of blood clots being inactive for long periods \u2013 such as after an operation or during a long journey blood vessel damage \u2013 a damaged blood vessel wall can result in the formation of a blood clot having certain conditions or treatments that cause your blood to clot more easily than normal \u2013 such as cancer (including chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment), heart and lung disease, thrombophilia and Hughes syndrome being pregnant \u2013 your blood also clots more easily during pregnancy being overweight or obese The combined contraceptive pill and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) both contain the female hormone oestrogen, which causes the blood to clot more easily. If you're taking either of these, your risk of developing DVT is slightly increased. Read more about the causes of DVT. Diagnosing DVT See your GP as soon as possible if you think you may have DVT \u2013 for example, if you have pain, swelling and a heavy ache in your leg. They'll ask you about your symptoms and medical history. D-dimer test It can be difficult to diagnose DVT from symptoms alone, so your GP may advise that you have a specialised blood test called a D-dimer test. This test detects pieces of blood clot that have been broken down and are loose in your bloodstream. The larger the number of fragments found, the more likely it is that you have a blood clot in your vein. However, the D-dimer test isn't always reliable because blood clot fragments can increase after an operation, injury or during pregnancy. Additional tests, such as an ultrasound scan, will need to be carried out to confirm DVT. Ultrasound scan An ultrasound scan can be used to detect clots in your veins. A special type of ultrasound called a Doppler ultrasound can also be used to find out how fast the blood is flowing through a blood vessel. This helps doctors identify when blood flow is slowed or blocked, which could be caused by a blood clot. Venogram A venogram may be used if the results of a D-dimer test and ultrasound scan can't confirm a diagnosis of DVT. During a venogram, a liquid called a contrast dye is injected into a vein in your foot. The dye travels up the leg and can be detected by X-ray, which will highlight a gap in the blood vessel where a clot is stopping the flow of blood. Treating DVT Treatment for DVT usually involves taking anticoagulant medicines, which reduce the blood's ability to clot and stop existing clots getting bigger. Heparin and warfarin are two types of anticoagulant often used to treat DVT. Heparin is usually prescribed first because it works immediately to prevent further clotting. After initial treatment, you may also need to take warfarin to prevent another blood clot forming. A number of anticoagulants, known as directly acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), may also be used to treat conditions such as DVT. These medications include rivaroxaban and apixaban, and they've been shown to be as effective as heparin and warfarin with less serious side effects. You'll also be prescribed compression stockings to wear every day, which will improve your symptoms and help prevent complications. Read more about treating DVT. Preventing DVT If you need to go into hospital for surgery, a member of your care team will assess your risk of developing a blood clot while you're there. If you're at risk of developing DVT, there are a number of things you can do to prevent a blood clot occurring, both before you go into hospital, such as temporarily stopping taking the combined contraceptive pill, and while you're in hospital, such as wearing compression stockings. When you leave hospital, your care team may also make a number of recommendations to help prevent DVT returning or complications developing. These may include: not smoking eating a healthy, balanced diet taking regular exercise  maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if you're obese There's no evidence to suggest that taking aspirin reduces your risk of developing DVT. See your GP before embarking on long-distance travel if you're at risk of getting a DVT, or if you've had a DVT in the past. When taking a long-distance journey (six hours or more) by plane, train or car, you should take steps to avoid getting DVT, such as drinking plenty of water, performing simple leg exercises and taking regular, short walking breaks.

It's estimated that around 25,000 people who are admitted to hospital die from preventable blood clots each year. The Department of Health has made the prevention of DVT a priority across the NHS. All patients admitted to hospital should be assessed for their risk of developing a blood clot and, if necessary, given preventative treatment. This recommendation was made by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2010. For more information, see the NICE guidance about venous thromboembolism: reducing the risk for patients in hospital.

There are two main types of restricted growth: proportionate short stature (PSS) \u2013 a general lack of growth, where the length of the trunk and limbs are in proportion disproportionate short stature (DSS) \u2013 where the limbs are shorter or out of proportion with other parts of the body As well as having short stature, some people with restricted growth also have other physical problems, such as bowed legs or an unusually curved spine. However, most people don't have any other serious problems. They can often live a relatively normal life and have a normal life expectancy. Read more about the symptoms of restricted growth. What causes restricted growth? The most common cause of PSS is being born to small parents, but it can sometimes occur as a result of the body not producing enough growth hormone. Certain genetic syndromes, such as Turner syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome, can also cause PSS. DSS usually occurs as part of a genetic condition, such as achondroplasia. Many children born with DSS have parents of average height and the faulty gene causing the condition occurred by chance. If your child is diagnosed with restricted growth, tests will be carried out to try to identify the underlying cause. Read more about the causes of restricted growth and diagnosing restricted growth. Managing restricted growth Treatments recommended for people with restricted growth depend on the cause of the condition and any associated problems they have. A number of different healthcare professionals will usually be involved in your care. Some people with restricted growth may benefit from treatment with growth hormone injections, which can help a child with restricted growth grow more than they otherwise would. In cases of DSS where the legs are particularly short, a leg-lengthening procedure is sometimes used, although this is controversial and there is uncertainty about its safety and effectiveness.

DEXA stands for \"dual energy X-ray absorptiometry\". This type of scan may also be called: a DXA scan a bone density scan a bone densitometry scan DEXA scans are often used to diagnose or assess someone's risk of osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones and makes them more likely to break. As well as being quick and painless, a DEXA scan is more effective than normal X-rays in identifying low bone mineral density. Osteoporosis You may need to have a DEXA scan if you're: over 50 years of age with a risk of developing osteoporosis under 50 with other risk factors \u2013 such as smoking or a previous fracture The World Health Organization (WHO) has created a 10-year Fracture Risk Assessment Tool, which applies to both men and women between 40 and 90 years of age. The tool can be used to assess if a DEXA scan is appropriate and calculates your risk of fracture in the next 10 years. Osteoporosis can affect people of both sexes and all ages, although older, post-menopausal women are particularly at risk. This is because after the menopause the level of oestrogen declines, resulting in a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD). The more dense your bones, the stronger and less likely they are to fracture (break). Osteoporosis doesn't cause any symptoms until a bone is broken. It used to be difficult to measure bone density and identify those at risk of developing osteoporosis until a fracture occurred. However, it's now possible to measure bone density before someone gets a fracture. Read more about when DEXA scans are used. Measuring bone density During a DEXA scan, X-rays are passed through your body. Some radiation is absorbed by the bone and soft tissue and some travels through your body. Special detectors in the DEXA scanner measure how much radiation passes through your bones, and this information is sent to a computer. Your bone density measurements will be compared with the bone density of a young healthy adult or an adult of your own age, gender and ethnicity. Read more about how DEXA scans are carried out. Safety DEXA scans use a much lower level of radiation than standard X-ray examinations, which means that the radiographer (the technical specialist carrying out the scan) can stay in the scanning room with you during the scan. The amount of radiation used during a DEXA scan varies depending on the area of the body being examined, but is very low and less than two days' exposure to natural background radiation (NBR). By comparison, a chest X-ray uses the equivalent of about three days' exposure to NBR, and a flight to North America is equivalent to approximately a week's exposure to NBR. Despite being very safe procedures, DEXA scans and X-rays aren't recommended for pregnant women, as X-rays can damage an unborn child. Read more about your health during pregnancy.

A child or adult with dysarthria may have: slurred, nasal-sounding or breathy speech a strained and hoarse voice excessively loud or quiet speech problems speaking in a regular rhythm, with frequent hesitations \"gurgly\"-sounding or monotone speech difficulty with tongue and lip movements difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), which may lead to constant drooling As a result of these problems, a person with dysarthria may be difficult to understand. In some cases, they may only be able to produce short phrases, single words, or no useful speech at all. Dysarthria does not affect intelligence or understanding, but a person with the condition may also have problems in these areas. Speech problems can also affect social interaction, employment and education. If you or your child has dysarthria, you may find it helpful to see a speech and language therapist. Ask your GP to refer you, or contact your nearest speech and language therapy clinic. What causes dysarthria? The muscles used for speech are controlled by the brain and nervous system. Dysarthria can develop if either of these is damaged in some way. Dysarthria can either be: developmental \u2013 when it occurs as a result of brain changes before or during birth, such as cerebral palsy acquired \u2013  when it occurs as the result of brain changes later in life, such as damage caused by a stroke, a head injury, a brain tumour, or a progressive condition such as Parkinson's disease or motor neurone disease Dysarthria in children is usually developmental while dysarthria in adults is often acquired, although both types can affect people of any age. Whether dysarthria will improve with speech and language therapy depends on what has caused the condition and the extent of the brain damage or dysfunction. Some cases may remain stable while others may worsen over time. How can a speech and language therapist help? Speech and language therapists (SLTs) play an important role in identifying and assessing children and adults with dysarthria. However, there's no guarantee that speech and language therapy can improve the speech of everyone with dysarthria.  Treatment success depends on the extent and location of the brain damage or brain dysfunction, or the stage of the progressive condition that's causing it. Diagnosing dysarthria To assess the extent of the speech problem, an SLT may ask you or your child to try any of the following tasks: make different sounds talk about a familiar topic count numbers or recite days of the week read a passage aloud The therapist may also want to examine the movement of the muscles in the mouth and voice box (larynx), and may wish to make a recording. Treating dysarthria An SLT will try to improve and maximise your ability to talk, help you find different ways of communicating, and help you and your family adapt to your new situation. They will work as part of a team of health professionals that includes people from the health, social and voluntary sector. It's difficult to generalise about what will be effective, as successful treatment is determined by an individual's underlying condition and personal circumstances. An SLT may recommend: strategies to improve speech, such as slowing speech down a programme of exercises to improve the volume or clarity of speech  assistive devices, such as a simple alphabet board, an amplifier, or a computerised voice output system Some SLTs may be able to offer a short loan of a communication aid. Read more about sources of support for carers of people with communication problems. Communication tips Tips for people with dysarthria If you have dysarthria, you may find it helpful to: take a good breath before you start speaking put extra effort into stressing key words speak slowly, saying one word at a time if necessary leave a clear space between each word make sure you are in the same room when talking and face your listener attract the listener's attention (for example, by touch or calling their name) before you begin talking to them keep sentences short and avoid long conversations if you are feeling tired reduce background noise \u2013 for example, switch off the TV or radio repeat yourself if needed Tips for family, friends and carers If you are speaking to a person with dysarthria, you may find the following advice helpful: reduce distractions and background noise when you have a conversation look at the person as they talk after speaking, allow them plenty of time to respond \u2013 if they feel rushed or pressured to speak, they may become anxious, which can affect their ability to communicate avoid finishing their sentences or correcting any errors in their language as this may cause resentment and frustration \u2013 ask what the person prefers if you do not understand what they are trying to communicate, do not pretend you understand as they may find this patronising and upsetting \u2013 it's always best to be honest about your lack of understanding if necessary, you could ask for clarification by asking yes\/no questions or paraphrasing \u2013 for example, say: \"Did you ask me if I'd done the shopping?\" Speech and language therapy Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

Other symptoms of dysentery can include: painful stomach cramps nausea or vomiting a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above, or 37.5C (99.5F) or above in children under five In the UK, most people with dysentery only experience mild symptoms. It's not always necessary to see a GP, as it tends to clear up within a week or so. See your GP if your symptoms are severe or don't start to improve after a few days. Tell them if you have recently been abroad. Treating dysentery Treatment isn't normally needed, as it usually clears up on its own. However, it's important to make sure you drink plenty of fluids and use oral rehydration solutions (ORS) if necessary, to avoid dehydration. See treating diarrhoea for more information on this. Over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol can help to relieve pain and a fever. It's best to avoid antidiarrhoeal medications such as loperamide, as they can make things worse. You should stay at home until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea, to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to others. If your symptoms are severe or persistent, your GP may prescribe a short course of antibiotics. In severe cases, you may need to be treated in hospital for a few days. What causes dysentery? There are two main types of dysentery: bacillary dysentery or shigellosis \u2013 caused by shigella bacteria; this is the most common type of dysentery in the UK amoebic dysentery or amoebiasis \u2013 caused by an amoeba (single-celled parasite) called Entamoeba histolytica, that's found mainly in tropical areas; this type of dysentery is usually picked up abroad Both types of dysentery are highly infectious and can be passed on if the poo of an infected person gets into another person's mouth. This can happen if someone with the infection doesn't wash their hands after going to the toilet and then touches food, surfaces, or another person. In the UK, the infection usually affects groups of people in close contact, such as families, schools and nurseries. There is also a chance of picking up the infection through anal or anal-oral sex (\"rimming\"). In developing countries with poor sanitation, infected poo may contaminate the water supply or food (particularly cold, uncooked food). Preventing dysentery You can reduce your risk of getting dysentery with good hygiene. You should: wash your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet, and regularly throughout the day wash your hands before handling, eating or cooking food avoid sharing towels wash the laundry of an infected person on the hottest setting possible Read more about food safety and hygiene in the home. If you're travelling to a country where there is a high risk of getting dysentery, the advice below can help to prevent infection. Don't drink the local water unless you're sure that it's sterile (clean) \u2013 safe alternatives are bottled water or drinks in sealed cans or bottles. If the water is not sterile, boil it for several minutes or use chemical disinfectant or a reliable filter. Don't clean your teeth with tap water. Don't have ice in your drinks, because it may be made from unclean water. Avoid fresh fruit or vegetables that can't be peeled before eating. Avoid food and drink sold by street vendors (except drinks from properly sealed cans or bottles). Read more about food and water safety abroad.

It can sometimes be confused with similar-looking conditions (see below). See your GP if you have any sort of blistering skin condition. Signs and symptoms of pompholyx Pompholyx usually starts as intense itching and burning of the skin on the hands and fingers. The palms and sides of the fingers (and sometimes the soles of the feet) then erupt into tiny itchy blisters that may weep fluid. In severe cases, the blisters may be quite large and may spread to the backs of the hands, feet and limbs. The skin can sometimes become infected. Signs of an infection can include the blisters becoming very painful and oozing pus or becoming covered in a golden crust. The blisters will usually heal within a few weeks. The skin tends to become dry and crack or peel as it starts to heal. What causes pompholyx? It's not clear exactly what causes pompholyx, but it may be triggered or made worse by: a fungal skin infection \u2013 this may be on the hands or at a distant site from the blisters (such as in between the toes) and will need treating a reaction to something that has touched your skin \u2013 such as certain metals (particularly nickel), detergents, household chemicals, soap, shampoo, cosmetic products or perfume stress sweating \u2013 pompholyx is more common in spring and summer, in warmer climates, and in people with hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) How long does it last? In many cases, pompholyx will clear up on its own within a few weeks. The treatments below may help relieve your symptoms in the meantime. Sometimes pompholyx may just occur once and never come back, but it often comes and goes over several months or years. Any of the triggers mentioned above can cause it to flare up again. Occasionally, pompholyx can be more continuous and difficult to treat. Treatments for pompholyx Protecting your skin You should try to avoid contact with anything that might irritate your skin, including soaps, shampoos and other household chemicals. Use an emollient as a soap substitute (see below) and wear cotton-lined gloves when you're at risk of contact with other potentially irritating substances, such as when washing your hair or doing housework. Don't burst the blisters \u2013 let them heal on their own. If they're particularly big, your GP may be able to drain them. Treating the symptoms The main treatments your GP may recommend to treat the symptoms of pompholyx are similar to those used when treating atopic eczema, including: emollients (moisturisers) \u2013 use these all the time and instead of soap to stop your skin becoming dry steroid cream \u2013 this reduces the inflammation and irritation and helps the skin to heal Your GP will probably prescribe a strong steroid cream to use for a short period of time, to minimise risk of steroid side effects. You may be advised to wear cotton gloves at night to help the cream sink into the skin. You can also try: soaking your hands in a dilute solution of potassium permanganate (1:10,000) for 10-15 minutes once or twice a day for up to five days antihistamines to relieve the itching and help you sleep if the itchiness is keeping you awake at night These treatments are available from pharmacies without a prescription. Your pharmacist can advise you whether they're suitable for you and how you should use them. Antibiotics may be prescribed if your skin becomes infected. Specialist treatments If your pompholyx keeps returning or is severe and doesn't get better with the above treatments, your GP may refer you to a specialist in treating skin conditions (dermatologist). A dermatologist may recommend one of the following treatments: phototherapy \u2013 controlled exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light steroid tablets or very strong steroid cream immunosuppressant creams or ointments, such as pimecrolimus or tacrolimus immunosuppressant tablets or capsules, such as ciclosporin or azathioprine alitretinoin capsules \u2013 medication that helps improve severe eczema affecting the hands when other treatments haven't worked Similar skin conditions Conditions that can have a similar appearance to pompholyx include: bullous impetigo \u2013 a contagious skin infection that mainly affects children and causes sores and blisters bullous pemphigoid \u2013 a blistering skin condition that tends to affect the elderly  contact dermatitis \u2013 a type of eczema caused by skin contact with a substance that causes irritation or an allergic reaction  hand, foot and mouth disease \u2013 a viral infection that mainly affects young children, which can cause small blisters to develop on the fingers and palms of the hands herpetic whitlow (whitlow finger) \u2013 an abscess (collection of pus) at the end of the finger that can cause it to become suddenly red, swollen, painful and blistered pustular psoriasis \u2013 an uncommon type of psoriasis that causes pus-filled blisters to appear on your skin Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 06\/07\/2015 Next review due: 06\/07\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's a \"specific learning difficulty\", which means it causes problems with certain abilities used for learning, such as reading and writing. Unlike a learning disability, intelligence isn't affected. It's estimated that up to 1 in every 10 to 20 people in the UK has some degree of dyslexia. Dyslexia is lifelong problem that can present challenges on a daily basis, but support is available to improve reading and writing skills and help those with the problem be successful at school and work. What are the signs of dyslexia? Signs of dyslexia usually become apparent when a child starts school and begins to focus more on learning how to read and write. A person with dyslexia may: read and write very slowly confuse the order of letters in words put letters the wrong way round \u2013 such as writing \"b\" instead of \"d\" have poor or inconsistent spelling understand information when told verbally, but have difficulty with information that's written down find it hard to carry out a sequence of directions struggle with planning and organisation However, people with dyslexia often have good skills in other areas, such as creative thinking and problem solving. Read more about the symptoms of dyslexia. Getting help If you think your child may have dyslexia, the first step is to speak to their teacher or their school's special needs coordinator (SENCO) about your concerns. They may be able to offer additional support to help your child if necessary. If your child continues to have problems despite extra support, you or the school may want to consider requesting a more in-depth assessment from a specialist dyslexia teacher or an educational psychologist. This can be arranged through the school, or you can request a private assessment by contacting: an educational psychologist directly \u2013 you can find a directory of chartered psychologists on the British Psychological Society's website a voluntary organisation that can arrange an assessment, such as Dyslexia Action or a local dyslexia association Adults who wish to be assessed for dyslexia should contact a local or national dyslexia association (see below) for advice. Read more about how dyslexia is diagnosed Support for people with dyslexia If your child has dyslexia, they'll probably need extra educational support from their school. With appropriate support, there's usually no reason your child can't go to a mainstream school, although a small number of children may benefit from attending a specialist school. Techniques and support that may help your child include: occasional one-to-one teaching or lessons in a small group with a specialist teacher phonics \u2013 a special learning technique that focuses on improving the ability to identify and process the smaller sounds that make up words technology, such as computers and speech recognition software, that may make it easier for your child to read and write when they're a bit older Universities also have specialist staff who can support young people with dyslexia in higher education. Technology such as word processors and electronic organisers can be useful for adults too. Employers are required to make reasonable adjustments to the workplace to help people with dyslexia, such as allowing extra time for certain tasks. Read more about how dyslexia is managed. Support groups As well as national dyslexia charities, such as Dyslexia Action and the British Dyslexia Association (BDA), there are several local dyslexia associations (LDAs). These are independently registered charities that run workshops and help to provide local support and access to information. You can find your local LDA on the BDA website. What causes dyslexia? People with dyslexia find it difficult to recognise the different sounds that make up words and relate these to letters.  Dyslexia isn't related to a person's general level of intelligence. Children and adults of all intellectual abilities can be affected by dyslexia. The exact cause of dyslexia is unknown, but it often appears to run in families. In people with dyslexia, it's thought that certain genes inherited from your parents may act together in a way that affects how some parts of brain develop during early life.

Most women experience it at some point in their lives. It's usually felt as painful muscle cramps in the tummy, which can spread to the back and thighs. The pain sometimes comes in intense spasms, while at other times it may be dull but more constant. It may also vary with each monthly period. Some periods may cause little or no discomfort, while others may be more painful. Sometimes you may experience pelvic pain even when you don't have your period. This page covers: What causes period pain? How long will my period pain last? How can I treat period pain? When should I see my GP? Can period pain affect fertility? What causes period pain? Period pain occurs when the muscular wall of the womb tightens (contracts). Mild contractions continually pass through your womb, but they're usually so mild that most women can't feel them. During your period, the wall of the womb starts to contract more vigorously to encourage the womb lining to shed away as part of your monthly period. When the muscular wall of the womb contracts, it compresses the blood vessels lining your womb. This temporarily cuts off the blood supply \u2013 and hence oxygen supply \u2013 to your womb. Without oxygen, the tissues in your womb release chemicals that trigger pain. While your body is releasing these pain-triggering chemicals, it's also producing other chemicals called prostaglandins. These encourage the womb muscles to contract more, further increasing the level of pain. It's not known why some women experience more period pain than others. It may be that some women have a build-up of prostaglandins, which means they experience stronger contractions. Period pain caused by a condition Less commonly, period pain can be caused by an underlying medical condition. Doctors sometimes call this secondary dysmenorrhoea. Period pain linked to an underlying condition tends to affect older women. Women aged 30 to 45 are most commonly affected. Conditions that can cause period pain include: endometriosis \u2013 where cells that normally line the womb start to grow in other places, such as in the fallopian tubes and ovaries; these cells can cause intense pain when they shed and fall away fibroids \u2013 non-cancerous tumours that can grow in the womb and can make your periods heavy and painful pelvic inflammatory disease \u2013 where your womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries become infected with bacteria, causing them to become severely inflamed adenomyosis \u2013 where the tissue that normally lines the womb starts to grow within the muscular womb wall, making your periods particularly painful An intrauterine device (IUD) is a type of contraception made from copper and plastic that fits inside the womb. It can also sometimes cause period pain, particularly during the first few months after it's inserted. You may notice a change in your normal pattern of pain if your period pain is linked to one of the above conditions. For example, the pain may be more severe or it may last much longer than normal. If your period pain is caused by an underlying condition, you may also experience: irregular periods  bleeding in between periods a thick or foul-smelling vaginal discharge pain during sex See your GP if you experience any of these symptoms. How long will my period pain last? Period pain usually starts when your bleeding begins, although some women have pain several days before the start of their period. The pain normally lasts 48 to 72 hours, although it can last longer. It's usually at its worst when your bleeding is heaviest. Teenage girls often have period pain when they begin getting periods. Read more about starting periods. Period pain that doesn't have an underlying cause tends to improve as a woman gets older. Many women also notice an improvement after they've had children. How can I treat period pain? In most cases period pain is mild enough to treat at home. Painkillers You can take ibuprofen and aspirin to help manage your pain. However, don't take ibuprofen or aspirin if you have asthma or stomach, kidney or liver problems. Aspirin shouldn't be given to anyone under 16 years of age. You could also try paracetamol, but studies have shown that it doesn't reduce pain as effectively as ibuprofen or aspirin. If ordinary painkillers are ineffective, your GP may prescribe a stronger painkiller, such as naproxen or codeine. Other things to try You could also try: stopping smoking \u2013 smoking is thought to increase the risk of period pain exercise \u2013 you may not feel like exercising during a painful period, but keeping active can reduce pain; try some gentle swimming, walking or cycling heat \u2013 putting a heat pad or hot water bottle (wrapped in a tea towel) on your tummy may help reduce pain warm bath or shower \u2013 taking a warm bath or shower can relieve pain and help you relax massage \u2013 light, circular massage around your lower abdomen may also help reduce pain relaxation techniques \u2013 relaxing activities, such as yoga or pilates, may help distract you from feelings of pain and discomfort transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulation (TENS) \u2013 a small battery-operated device that delivers a mild electrical current to your tummy, which can help reduce pain When should I see my GP? See your GP if you have severe period pain or your normal pattern of periods changes \u2013 for example, if your periods become heavier than usual or irregular. You should also see your GP if you have symptoms of secondary dysmenorrhoea, such as intense pain or heavy or painful periods. The pill Your GP may try you on the combined oral contraceptive pill. This can ease period pain because it thins the womb lining and reduces the amount of prostaglandin your body releases. A thinner womb lining means the muscles of the womb don't have to contract as much when it sheds as part of your monthly menstrual cycle. Your period will also be lighter. If the combined contraceptive pill isn't suitable for you, contraceptive implants or injections are good alternatives. The Mirena intrauterine system (IUS) can also sometimes help with painful periods. Pelvic examination Your GP may want to carry out a pelvic examination to help diagnose or rule out other conditions. They'll insert gloved, lubricated fingers into your vagina to feel for any abnormalities in your womb or ovaries. Pelvic examinations are only carried out by qualified healthcare professionals, such as GPs or gynaecologists. The examination won't be carried out without your permission (consent). You can also choose to have a friend or relative present, or a practice nurse to act as a chaperone. In some cases your GP may also order a pelvic ultrasound, which will clearly highlight any abnormalities. Referral to a specialist If your period pain hasn't been controlled after three months of treatment with painkillers or the combined contraceptive pill, your GP may refer you to a specialist. This is for further investigations to rule out an underlying medical condition. Further tests To help determine the cause of your period pain, the gynaecologist may need to carry out: a urine or blood test pelvic ultrasound \u2013 where high-frequency sound waves are used to produce an image of the inside of your body; it's painless and will allow any abnormalities in your reproductive organs to be detected laparoscopy \u2013 under general anaesthetic, a small cut is made in your abdomen through which a fibro-optic telescope (laparoscope) is inserted; it can be used to look at your internal organs, as well as take samples of tissue (a biopsy) hysteroscopy \u2013 allows the inside of the womb to be examined using a fibro-optic telescope; it's carefully passed through your vagina and into the womb to check for abnormalities Treating an underlying medical condition If your period pain is caused by an underlying condition, your treatment will depend on which condition you have. For example, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) may require antibiotics to treat the infection, while fibroids may need to be surgically removed. Can period pain affect fertility? Period pain that's part of your normal menstrual cycle won't affect your fertility. However, if the cause is an underlying condition, this may affect your fertility. For example, endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease can cause scarring and a build-up of tissue in your fallopian tubes, making it harder for sperm to reach and fertilise an egg.

Dyspepsia and heartburn may occur together or on their own. Symptoms usually appear soon after eating or drinking. Common associated symptoms include: feeling full or bloated feeling sick (nausea) belching bringing up (regurgitating) fluid or food into the gullet (oesophagus) Indigestion is a common problem that affects many people, but in most cases it's mild and only occurs occasionally. Read more about the symptoms of indigestion. Why it happens Indigestion may be caused by stomach acid coming into contact with the sensitive, protective lining of the digestive system (mucosa). The stomach acid breaks down the lining, leading to irritation and inflammation, which can be painful. The majority of people with indigestion don't have inflammation in their digestive system. Therefore, their symptoms are thought to be caused by increased sensitivity of the mucosa (to acidity or stretching). In most cases indigestion is related to eating, although it can be triggered by other factors such as smoking, drinking, alcohol, pregnancy, stress or taking certain medications. Read more about the causes of indigestion. Treating indigestion at home Most people are able to treat indigestion with simple changes to their diet and lifestyle, or with a number of different medications, such as antacids. Read more about the treatment of indigestion. Read how to ease indigestion in pregnancy. Very rarely, a serious underlying health condition is the cause of indigestion. If this is suspected, then further investigation such as an endoscopy will be required (see below). When to see your doctor Most people will not need to seek medical advice for their indigestion. However, it is important to see your GP if you have recurring indigestion and any of the following apply: you are 55 years old or over you have lost a lot of weight without meaning to you have increasing difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) you have persistent vomiting you have iron deficiency anaemia you have a lump in your stomach you have blood in your vomit or blood in your stools This is because these symptoms may be a sign of an underlying health condition, such as a stomach ulcer or stomach cancer. You may need to be referred for an endoscopy to rule out any serious cause. An endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of the body is examined using an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube that has a light and camera on one end). Severe indigestion can cause long-term problems with parts of your digestive tract, such as scarring of the oesophagus or the passage from your stomach.

The symptoms usually come on after eating food. Heartburn is a strong, burning pain in the chest caused by stomach acid passing from your stomach into your oesophagus (the tube that leads from your mouth to your stomach).  You can help ease the discomfort of indigestion and heartburn by making changes to your diet and lifestyle, and there are treatments that are safe to take in pregnancy. Talk to your midwife, GP or pharmacist. You can also find out more by reading this page or clicking on the links to go directly to the relevant information. Symptoms of indigestion Causes of indigestion in pregnancy Treatment for indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy Self-help tips for indigestion and heartburn Symptoms of indigestion in pregnancy Symptoms of indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy are the same as for anyone else with the condition. The main symptom is pain or a feeling of discomfort in your chest or stomach. This usually happens soon after eating or drinking, but there can sometimes be a delay between eating a meal and developing indigestion. You may experience indigestion at any point during your pregnancy, although your symptoms may be more frequent and severe during later pregnancy, from 27 weeks onwards. As well as pain, indigestion may cause: heartburn, a burning sensation caused by acid passing from the stomach into the oesophagus feeling uncomfortable or heavy belching (burping) regurgitation (food coming back up from the stomach) bloating nausea (feeling sick) vomiting (being sick) Causes of indigestion in pregnancy The symptoms of indigestion (dyspepsia), including heartburn, are caused by stomach acid coming into contact with the sensitive protective lining (mucosa) of your digestive system. The stomach acid breaks down the mucosa, which causes irritation and leads to the symptoms of indigestion. When you're pregnant, you are more likely to have indigestion due to:  hormonal changes that your body is going through your growing womb (uterus) pressing on your stomach the relaxing of the lower oesophageal sphincter (ring of muscle) that acts like a gate between your stomach and your oesophagus, allowing stomach acid to leak back up You may be more likely to get indigestion in pregnancy if: you had indigestion before you were pregnant you have been pregnant before you are in the latter stages of pregnancy Your GP or midwife will usually be able to diagnose indigestion or heartburn from your symptoms and by asking you some questions. For example, they might ask:  how the symptoms are affecting your day-to-day life what your usual eating habits are if you have tried any treatments already if you experienced indigestion or any other stomach conditions before you were pregnant Your GP or midwife may also examine your chest and stomach. They may press gently on different areas of your chest and stomach to see whether this is painful. Treatments for indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy In some cases, changes to your diet and lifestyle may be enough to control indigestion, particularly if the symptoms are mild. If you have severe indigestion, or if changes to your diet and lifestyle don't work, your GP or midwife may suggest using medication to help ease your symptoms. Several indigestion medicines are safe to use during pregnancy. However, check with your GP, midwife or pharmacist before taking anything they have not recommended. The types of medicines that may be prescribed for indigestion and heartburn during pregnancy are: Antacids Antacids are a type of medicine that can provide immediate relief from indigestion. They work by neutralising the acid in your stomach (making it less acidic) so that it no longer irritates the protective lining (mucosa) of your digestive system. Alginates Some antacids are combined with another type of medicine known as an alginate. This helps relieve indigestion caused by acid reflux. Acid reflux occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your oesophagus and irritates its protective lining. Alginates work by forming a foam barrier that floats on the surface of your stomach contents. This keeps stomach acid in your stomach and away from your oesophagus. In most cases, antacids and alginates can effectively control the symptoms of indigestion during pregnancy. Choice and dosage A number of antacids are available over-the-counter from your pharmacist without a prescription. Ask your pharmacist for advice about which ones are suitable for you. You may only need to take antacids and alginates when you start to experience symptoms. In other cases, your GP may recommend that you take these medicines before your symptoms are expected, such as: before a meal before bed It is safe to use antacids and alginates while you are pregnant as long as you do not take more than the recommended dose. Follow the instructions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine to ensure that you take it correctly. Side effects from antacids are rare, but can include: diarrhoea  constipation  Iron supplements If you are prescribed an antacid medicine and you are also taking iron supplements, do not take them at the same time. Antacids can prevent iron from being properly absorbed by your body. Take your antacid at least two hours before or after your iron supplement. Acid-suppressing medicines If antacids and alginates do not improve your symptoms of indigestion, your GP may prescribe a different medicine that suppresses the acid in your stomach. There are two acid-suppressing medicines that are safe to use during pregnancy: ranitidine omeprazole As with antacids and alginates, follow the dosage instructions on the patient information leaflet or packet. Ranitidine Ranitidine is usually prescribed as tablets to be taken twice a day. Follow the dosage instructions, as your medicine may not work if you only take it when you have symptoms. Ranitidine rarely causes any side effects. Omeprazole Omeprazole is usually prescribed as a tablet to take once a day. After five days, your symptoms should have improved. If not, your dose may need to be increased. In some cases, omeprazole may cause side effects such as: headaches diarrhoea nausea vomiting Self-help tips for indigestion in pregnancy You may not need medicine to control your symptoms. Your GP or midwife may suggest some of the following changes to your diet and lifestyle. In many cases, these changes can be enough to ease your symptoms. Stop smoking to banish indigestion Smoking when you're pregnant can cause indigestion and seriously affect your health, as well as the health of your unborn baby. Smoking increases the risk of:  your baby being born prematurely (before week 37 of your pregnancy) your baby being born with a low birth weight cot death, or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) When you smoke, the chemicals you inhale can contribute to your indigestion. These chemicals can cause the ring of muscle at the lower end of your oesophagus to relax. This allows stomach acid to leak back up into your oesophagus more easily (known as acid reflux). If you smoke, quitting is the best thing that you can do for your own and your baby's health. You can speak to your GP or midwife for more information, or you can call the NHS Smokefree Helpline, which offers support and encouragement to help you quit smoking. You can call them on 0300 123 1044 or go to the NHS Smokefree website. Here are 8 steps to take to help you stop smoking right away. Avoid alcohol to ease indigestion Drinking alcohol can contribute to the symptoms of indigestion. During pregnancy, it can also put your unborn baby at risk of developing serious birth defects. Find out more about alcohol and pregnancy. The Department of Health recommends that all pregnant women avoid drinking alcohol completely during pregnancy. It advises that if you do choose to drink while you're pregnant, to minimise risks to your baby you should not drink more than 1-2 units of alcohol once or twice a week, and should not get drunk. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant should avoid drinking alcohol in the first three months of pregnancy because there may be an increased risk of miscarriage. One UK unit is 10ml (or eight grams) of pure alcohol. This is equal to:  half a pint of beer, lager or cider at 3.5% alcohol by volume (ABV: you can find this on the label) a single measure (25ml) of spirit, such as whisky, gin, rum or vodka, at 40% ABV  half a standard (175ml) glass of wine at 11.5% ABV You can find out how many units there are in different types and brands of drinks with the Drinkaware unit calculator. If you have difficulty cutting down what you drink, talk to your midwife, doctor or pharmacist. Confidential help and support is available from local counselling services (look in the telephone directory or contact Drinkline on 0300 123 1110). Eat healthily to avoid indigestion You are more likely to get indigestion if you are very full, so regularly eating large amounts of food may make your symptoms worse. If you are pregnant, it can be tempting to eat more than you would normally, but this may not be good for you or your baby. You don't need to \"eat for two\". During pregnancy you do not need to go on a special diet, but it is important to eat a variety of different foods every day to get the right balance of nutrients that you and your baby need. Find out more about eating a healthy diet in pregnancy and foods to avoid. Change your eating habits In some cases, you may be able to control your indigestion by making changes to the way you eat. For example:  it may help to eat smaller meals more frequently, rather than larger meals three times a day avoid eating within three hours of going to bed at night sit up straight when you eat because this will take the pressure off your stomach Drinking a glass of milk may relieve heartburn (the burning sensation from stomach acid leaking up into your oesophagus). You may want to keep a glass of milk beside your bed in case you wake up with heartburn in the night. Avoid indigestion triggers You may find that your indigestion is made worse by certain triggers, such as:  drinking fruit juice eating chocolate bending over Make a note of any particular food, drink or activity that seems to make your indigestion worse and avoid them if possible. This may mean: eating less rich, spicy and fatty foods cutting down on drinks that contain caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola (find out more about caffeine and pregnancy) Prop your head up When you go to bed, use a couple of pillows to prop your head and shoulders up, or raise the head of your bed by a few inches by putting something underneath the mattress. The slight slope should help prevent stomach acid from moving up into your oesophagus while you sleep.  Prescription medicines Speak to your GP if you are taking medication for another condition, such as antidepressants or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and you think it may be contributing to your indigestion. Your GP may be able to prescribe an alternative medicine. Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are advised to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care.

Some people with dysphagia have problems swallowing certain foods or liquids, while others can't swallow at all. Other signs of dysphagia include: coughing or choking when eating or drinking bringing food back up, sometimes through the nose a sensation that food is stuck in your throat or chest persistent drooling of saliva  Over time, dysphagia can also cause symptoms such as weight loss and repeated chest infections. You should see your GP if you have swallowing difficulties. What causes dysphagia? Dysphagia is usually caused by another health condition, such as: a condition that affects the nervous system, such as a stroke, head injury, or dementia cancer \u2013 such as mouth cancer or oesophageal cancer  gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) \u2013 where stomach acid leaks back up into the oesophagus Dysphagia can also occur in children as the result of a developmental or learning disability. Dysphagia can be caused by problems with the: mouth or throat, known as oropharyngeal or \"high\" dysphagia oesophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach), known as oesophageal or \"low\" dysphagia   Read more about the causes of dysphagia. Treating dysphagia Treatment usually depends on the cause and type of dysphagia. The type of dysphagia you have can usually be diagnosed after testing your swallowing ability and examining your oesophagus. Many cases of dysphagia can be improved with treatment, but a cure isn't always possible. Treatments for dysphagia include: speech and language therapy to learn new swallowing techniques  changing the consistency of food and liquids to make them safer to swallow alternative forms of feeding, such as tube feeding through the nose or stomach surgery to widen the narrowing of the oesophagus by stretching it or inserting a plastic or metal tube (known as a stent) Read more about diagnosing dysphagia and treating dysphagia. Complications of dysphagia Dysphagia can sometimes lead to further problems. One of the most common problems is coughing or choking when food goes down the \"wrong way\" and blocks your airway. If this occurs frequently, you may avoid eating and drinking because you fear choking, which can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. Some people with dysphagia have a tendency to develop chest infections, such as aspiration pneumonia, which require medical treatment.

It's sometimes known as congenital hip dislocation or hip dysplasia. The hip joint attaches the thigh bone (femur) to the pelvis. The top of the femur (femoral head) is rounded like a ball and sits inside the cup-shaped hip socket. In DDH, the socket of the hip is too shallow and the femoral head isn't held tightly in place, so the hip joint is loose. In severe cases, the femur can come out of the socket (dislocate). DDH may affect one or both hips but is more common in the left hip. It's also more common in girls and firstborn children. About 1 or 2 in every 1,000 babies have DDH that needs treating. Without treatment, DDH may lead to problems later in life, including: developing a limp hip pain \u2013 especially during the teenage years painful and stiff joints (osteoarthritis) With early diagnosis and treatment, most children are able to develop normally and have a full range of movement in their hip. Diagnosing DDH Within 72 hours of giving birth, your baby's hips will be checked as part of the newborn physical examination. Another hip examination is carried out when your baby is between six and eight weeks old. The examination involves gentle manipulation of your baby's hip joints to check if there are any problems, and shouldn't cause them any discomfort. An ultrasound scan is usually recommended within a few weeks if: the hip feels unstable there's a family history of childhood hip problems your baby was born in the breech position (feet first with their bottom downwards) you've had twins or a multiple birth your baby was born prematurely \u2013 before the 37th week of pregnancy Sometimes a baby's hip stabilises on its own before the scan is due. Treating DDH Pavlik harness Babies diagnosed with DDH early in life are usually treated with a fabric splint known as a Pavlik harness. This secures both of your baby's hips in a stable position and allows them to develop normally. The harness needs to be worn constantly for several weeks and shouldn't be removed by anyone except a health professional. The harness may be adjusted during follow-up appointments and your clinician will discuss your baby's progress with you. Your hospital will provide detailed instructions on how to look after your baby while they're in a Pavlik harness. This will include information on: how to change your baby's clothes without removing the harness (nappies can be worn normally) cleaning the harness if it's soiled \u2013 it still shouldn't be removed, but may be cleaned with detergent and an old toothbrush or nail brush positioning your baby while they sleep \u2013 they should be placed on their back and not on their side how to help avoid skin irritation around the straps of the harness \u2013 you may be advised to wrap some soft, hygienic material around the bands Eventually, you may be given advice on removing and replacing the harness for short periods of time until it can be permanently removed. You'll be encouraged to allow your baby to move freely when the harness is off and swimming is often recommended. Surgery Surgery may be needed if your baby is diagnosed with DDH after they're six months old, or if the Pavlik harness hasn't worked. The most common surgical technique is known as reduction, which involves placing the ball of the femur back into the hip socket. Reduction is carried out under general anaesthetic and may be performed as either: closed reduction \u2013 the ball is placed in the socket without making any large cuts (incisions) open reduction \u2013 an incision is made in the groin to allow the surgeon to place the ball in the socket Your child will need a hip cast for at least six weeks after surgery. Their hip will need to be checked under general anaesthetic again after this time to make sure it's stable and healing well. After this investigation, a cast will probably be needed for at least another six weeks to allow the hip to fully stabilise. Some children may also require bone surgery (osteotomy) during an open reduction, or at a later date to correct any bone deformities. Late-stage signs of DDH The newborn physical examination and the check at six to eight weeks aim to diagnose DDH early. However, sometimes hip problems can develop after these checks. It's important to contact your GP as soon as possible if you notice your child develops any of the following symptoms: restricted movement in one leg when you change their nappy one leg drags behind the other when they crawl one leg appears longer than the other uneven skin folds in the buttocks or thighs a limp, walking on toes or developing an abnormal 'waddling' walk Your child will be referred to an orthopaedic specialist in hospital for an ultrasound scan or an X-ray if your doctor thinks there's a problem with their hip. Preventing DDH It's important to remember that DDH can't be prevented and it's nobody's fault. A baby's hips are naturally more flexible for a short period after birth. However, if your baby spends a lot of time tightly wrapped with their legs straight and pressed together (swaddled), there's a risk this may slow their hip development. Using 'hip healthy' swaddling techniques can reduce this risk. Make sure your baby is able to move their hips and knees freely to kick. You can read about hip-healthy swaddling on The International Hip Dysplasia Institute website.

It's also one of the most common reasons people call 999 for an ambulance. It's normal to get out of breath when you've overexerted yourself, but when breathlessness comes on suddenly and unexpectedly, it's usually a warning sign of a medical condition. The information below outlines the most common reasons for: sudden shortness of breath long-term shortness of breath This guide shouldn't be used to self-diagnose your condition, but should give you an idea of what's causing your breathlessness. When to call a doctor You should call your GP immediately if you have sudden shortness of breath, as there may be a problem with your airways or heart. Your GP will assess you over the phone, and may either visit you at home or admit you to hospital. If your shortness of breath is the result of anxiety, you may be asked to come to the surgery rather than a home visit. If you've struggled with your breathing for a while, don't ignore it. See your GP as it's likely you have a long-term condition, such as obesity, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which needs to be managed properly. Your doctor may ask you some questions, such as: Did the breathlessness come on suddenly or gradually? Did anything trigger it, such as exercise? How bad is it? Does it only happen when you've been active, or when you're not doing anything? Is there any pain when you breathe? Do you have a cough? Do certain positions make it worse \u2013 for example, are you unable to lie down? Feeling like you can't get enough air can be terrifying, but doctors are well trained in managing this. You may be given extra oxygen to breathe if this is needed. Causes of sudden shortness of breath Sudden and unexpected breathlessness is most likely to be caused by one of the following health conditions. Click on the links below for more information about these conditions. A problem with your lungs or airways Sudden breathlessness could be an asthma attack. This means your airways have narrowed and you'll produce more phlegm (sticky mucus), which causes you to wheeze and cough. You'll feel breathless because it's difficult to move air in and out of your airways. Your GP may advise you to use a spacer device with your asthma inhaler. This delivers more medicine to your lungs, helping to relieve your breathlessness. Pneumonia (lung inflammation) may also cause shortness of breath and a cough. It's usually caused by an infection, so you'll need to take antibiotics. If you have COPD, it's likely your breathlessness is a sign this condition has suddenly got worse. A heart problem  It's possible to have a \"silent\" heart attack without experiencing all the obvious symptoms, such as chest pain and overwhelming anxiety. In this case, shortness of breath may be the only warning sign you're having a heart attack. If you or your GP think this is the case, they'll give you aspirin and admit you to hospital straight away. Heart failure can also cause breathing difficulties. This life-threatening condition means your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly. It leads to a build-up of water inside the lungs, which makes breathing more difficult. A combination of lifestyle changes and medicines or surgery will help the heart pump better and relieve your breathlessness. Breathlessness could also relate to a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate). Panic attack or anxiety A panic attack or anxiety can cause you to take rapid or deep breaths, known as hyperventilating. Concentrating on slow breathing or breathing through a paper bag should bring your breathing back to normal. More unusual causes These include: a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) pneumothorax \u2013 partial collapse of your lung caused by a small tear in the lung surface, which allows air to become trapped in the space around your lungs pulmonary embolism \u2013 a blockage in one of the blood vessels in the lung idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis \u2013 a rare and poorly understood lung condition that causes scarring of the lungs pleural effusion \u2013 a collection of fluid next to the lung diabetic ketoacidosis \u2013 a complication of diabetes where acids build up in your blood and urine Causes of long-term breathlessness Long-term breathlessness is usually caused by: obesity or being unfit poorly controlled asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \u2013 permanent damage to the lungs usually caused by years of smoking anaemia \u2013 a low level of oxygen in the blood caused by a lack of red blood cells or haemoglobin (the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen) heart failure \u2013 when your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate) More unusual causes of long-term breathlessness are: bronchiectasis \u2013 a lung condition where the airways are abnormally widened and you have a persistent phlegmy cough pulmonary embolism \u2013 a recurrent blockage in a blood vessel in the lung partial collapse of your lung caused by lung cancer pleural effusion \u2013 a collection of fluid next to the lung narrowing of the main heart valve, restricting blood flow to the rest of the body frequent panic attacks, which can cause you to hyperventilate (take rapid or deep breaths)  Page last reviewed: 29\/01\/2015 Next review due: 29\/01\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

DCD is thought to be around three or four times more common in boys than girls, and the condition sometimes runs in families. This topic is about DCD in children, although the condition often causes continued problems into adulthood.  Read about DCD in adults. Symptoms of DCD Early developmental milestones of crawling, walking, self-feeding and dressing may be delayed in young children with DCD, and drawing, writing and performance in sports are usually behind what is expected for their age. Although signs of the condition are present from an early age, children vary widely in their rate of development, and DCD isn't usually definitely diagnosed until a child with the condition is around five years old or more. Read about symptoms of DCD in children. When to seek medical advice Talk to your GP or health visitor \u2013 or a nurse, doctor or special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) at your child's school \u2013 if you have any concerns about your child's health or development. If necessary, they can refer your child to a community paediatrician, who will assess them and try to identify any developmental problems. Read about diagnosing DCD in children. Causes of DCD Carrying out co-ordinated movements is a complex process that involves many different nerves and parts of the brain. Any problem in this process could potentially lead to difficulties with movement and co-ordination. It's not usually clear why co-ordination doesn't develop as well as other abilities in children with DCD. However, a number of risk factors that can increase a child's likelihood of developing DCD have been identified. These include: being born prematurely \u2013 before the 37th week of pregnancy being born with a low birth weight having a family history of DCD \u2013 although it is not clear exactly which genes may be involved in the condition the mother drinking alcohol or taking illegal drugs while pregnant Treating DCD There's no cure for DCD, but a number of therapies can make it easier for children to manage their problems. These include: being taught ways of carrying out activities they find difficult \u2013 such as breaking down difficult movements into much smaller parts and practising them regularly adapting tasks to make them easier \u2013 such as using special grips on pens and pencils so they are easier to hold Although DCD doesn't affect how intelligent a child is, it can make it more difficult for them to learn and they may need extra help to keep up at school. Treatment for DCD will be tailored to your child and usually involves a number of different healthcare professionals working together. Although the physical co-ordination of a child with DCD will remain below average, this often becomes less of a problem as they get older. However, difficulties in school \u2013 particularly producing written work \u2013 can become much more prominent and require extra help from parents and teachers. Read about treating DCD in children.

Media last reviewed: 12\/05\/2016 Next review due: 12\/05\/2018 Dyspraxia or DCD? While many people in the UK use the term dyspraxia to refer to the difficulties with movement and co-ordination that first develop in young children, the term is used less often by health professionals nowadays. Instead, most healthcare professionals use the term developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD) to describe the condition. This term is generally preferred by healthcare professionals because, strictly speaking, dyspraxia can have several meanings. For example, dyspraxia can be used to describe movement difficulties that occur later in life as a result of damage to the brain, such as from a stroke or head injury. Some health professionals may also use the term specific developmental disorder of motor function (SDDMF) to refer to DCD.

It is also known as developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD). Dyspraxia\/DCD is often spotted at a young age but there may be many adults with dyspraxia who remain undiagnosed. Dyspraxia affects co-ordination skills such as tasks requiring balance, kicking and throwing a ball and fine motor skills (such as writing or using small objects carefully) in children and adults. It is a condition that will last for life and is recognised by international organisations, including the World Health Organization. Dyspraxia is different from other motor disorders such as cerebral palsy and stroke, and occurs in people of all intellectual abilities.  This page focuses on dyspraxia\/DCD in adults. Read about childhood dyspraxia. Symptoms of dyspraxia The symptoms of dyspraxia can vary between individuals and may change over time. Co-ordination difficulties The co-ordination difficulties associated with dyspraxia can reduce the person's ability to participate and function in education and employment. Difficulties with self-care, writing, typing, riding a bike and playing may start in childhood and continue into adulthood. An adult may also experience new difficulties, for example with driving a vehicle or DIY. Other difficulties Adults with dyspraxia may also have social and emotional difficulties, as well as problems with time management, planning and personal organisation. These may affect the person's education or employment. Diagnosing adult dyspraxia The first person to contact if you think you may have undiagnosed dyspraxia or co-ordination difficulties is your GP. It\u2019s a good idea to take in information with you, such as a checklist with examples of how the symptoms and signs of dyspraxia apply to you.  You may be referred for an assessment by a physiotherapist or an occupational therapist, who will assess your movements and how it affects you day to day.  Who is affected? Estimates vary, but dyspraxia is thought to affect around 3% of adults in the UK. It is more common in men, and often runs in families. It is not known what causes dyspraxia, but some children born prematurely have a higher risk of having dyspraxia. People with dyspraxia may also have other related conditions, such as: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) dyslexia autism spectrum disorder speech and language impairments difficulty learning or understanding maths (dyscalculia) You may also have another health condition that may require separate treatment, such as depression or anxiety. Talk to your GP if either of these conditions affect you. Treating dyspraxia in adults Dyspraxia does not affect intelligence, but may make learning new skills more difficult. Adults with dyspraxia may have developed coping strategies to find ways around everyday tasks they find difficult. For example, you may find your movement problems improve as you find ways to adapt. As you grow older and accept yourself, your confidence and self-esteem may also improve. This may be because the pressure to 'fit in' as an adult is not as strong as when you were a child and teenager. Some people also find staying fit helps their co-ordination, reduces feelings of fatigue and helps with potential weight gain. Therapies Although there is no cure for dyspraxia, there are therapies to help adults cope. These are described below. Occupational therapy can help you find practical ways to remain independent and manage everyday tasks such as writing or preparing food.  Talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT) may also help. CBT aims to help you talk about your problems and identify ways to change your behaviour so you can manage your problems more effectively. SFBT aims to help you identify what you wish to achieve through therapy, rather than talking about the problem itself.  Other conditions If you have dyspraxia, you may also have another health condition that requires separate treatment. For example: depression (long-term feelings of sadness) \u2013 this can be treated with a combination of exercise, talking therapies and antidepressant medication anxiety (constant feelings of worry and unease) \u2013 this can be treated with medication, talking therapies and a number of self-help measures, such as relaxation techniques Talk to your GP if either of these conditions affect you. Useful tips for dealing with dyspraxia use a calendar or diary to improve your organisation \u2013 synchronise this with your phone and computer if possible learn how to talk positively about your challenges and how you have overcome them learn how to use a computer or laptop if writing by hand is difficult seek out support through programmes such as Access to Work from JobCentrePlus For more information and support for dyspraxia\/DCD, you can visit the following websites: the Dyspraxia Foundation has a list of local support groups you can join to share your experiences with similar people Box of Ideas Movement Matters Similar medical terms Some conditions have names similar to dyspraxia, or share some of the symptoms. Some of the similar medical terms you may come across are explained below.   Apraxia \u2013 the inability to carry out certain tasks, although you know how to do them and have the physical ability to perform them. For example, you may not be able to lick your lips or move your eyes. Apraxia may be caused by another health condition or brain damage. Aphasia \u2013 a language disorder where people have problems speaking, writing and understanding the spoken and written word. Aphasia is not a condition in itself, but a symptom of brain damage, such as a stroke. Dyslexia \u2013 a common type of learning difficulty that mainly affects skills involved in reading and spelling words. Dyslexia should be recognised as a spectrum disorder, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe.

The spasms and contractions may either be sustained or may come and go. Movements are often repetitive and cause unusual, awkward and sometimes painful postures. Tremor (shaking) can also be a characteristic of some types of dystonia. Dystonia is thought to be a neurological condition (caused by underlying problems with the brain and nervous system). However, in most cases, brain functions such as intelligence, memory and language remain unaffected. Types of dystonia Dystonia can affect only one muscle or a group of muscles. There are five main types of dystonia: Focal dystonia \u2013 where a single region, such as the hand or eyes, is affected. Cervical dystonia, blepharospasm (abnormal twitch of the eyelid), laryngeal dystonia and writer's cramp are all examples of focal dystonia. If it only affects someone during specific activities, such as writing, it's described as task-specific dystonia. Segmental dystonia \u2013 where two or more connected regions of the body are affected. Cranial dystonia (blepharospasm affecting the lower face and jaw or tongue) is an example.  Multifocal dystonia \u2013 where two or more regions of the body that aren't connected to each other, such as the left arm and left leg, are affected.  Generalised dystonia \u2013 where the trunk and at least two other parts of the body are affected. The legs may or may not be affected.  Hemidystonia \u2013 where one entire side of the body is affected.  About 90% of all cases are either cervical dystonia (which affects the neck muscles) or blepharospasm (which affects the eyelids). These are both focal dystonias that tend to develop later in life. They don\u2019t usually get any worse and no other muscles are affected. Read more about the symptoms of dystonia. Causes of dystonia Exactly how dystonia develops remains uncertain, but it's thought to be caused by a problem with the part of the brain that controls muscle movement (the basal ganglia). If there's no identifiable cause of dystonia, or if the cause is genetic, it's described as primary dystonia. Secondary dystonia is where dystonia occurs as a symptom of an underlying condition or injury. Common causes include stroke, brain injury, encephalitis and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Read more about the causes of dystonia. Diagnosing dystonia Dystonia is diagnosed by a specialist examining and recognising the typical symptoms. The type of dystonia is then classified by which area of the body is affected. When diagnosing dystonia, it's important to confirm whether you have primary or secondary dystonia, because this may determine the type of treatment you need. If you have typical signs of late-onset focal dystonia, specific investigations may not be required. However, tests may be needed to confirm whether you have primary or secondary dystonia. These may include brain scans, urine or blood tests, and genetic testing. Read more about how dystonia is diagnosed. Treating dystonia There's no cure for dystonia, but the condition can usually be effectively managed.  Treatment will vary, depending on the type of dystonia you have and the precise nature of your symptoms. However, the four main types of treatment are: botulinum toxin \u2013 widely used to treat neurological conditions that involve abnormal muscle contractions, such as dystonia; it's injected into the affected muscles to temporarily weaken them and reduce spasms medication \u2013 such as anticholinergics, Baclofen and muscle relaxants physiotherapy \u2013 where exercises are used to improve range of motion and posture, and prevent muscle weakness surgery \u2013 if other treatments are unsuccessful, the nerves controlling the muscles causing spasms can be cut (selective peripheral denervation), or electrodes can be implanted within the brain, which are connected to a small device that's similar to a pacemaker (deep brain stimulation) Read more about how dystonia is treated. Outlook Dystonia is an unpredictable condition. It tends to progress slowly and the severity of a person's symptoms can vary from one day to another. Focal dystonia usually progresses gradually over a period of about five years and then doesn't get any worse. Sometimes, a person's symptoms improve or disappear completely. This is known as total remission and it's thought to occur in around 5-10% of people. Total remission is more likely in cases of secondary dystonia, such as dystonia that occurs after a stroke. If someone has another underlying condition, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, the symptoms of dystonia are more likely to last for the rest of their lives. Who is affected by dystonia? Dystonia is generally uncommon, although it's one of the more common neurological conditions. Dystonia can affect men, women and children. It can be difficult to diagnose, and there may be many people with the condition who remain undiagnosed. The Dystonia Society estimates that at least 70,000 people are affected by dystonia in the UK. At least 8,000 of these are children and young people.
