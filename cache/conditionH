They're often present at birth or develop soon afterwards. There are several different types of birthmark and some of them are very common. The two main types of birthmark are: vascular birthmarks (often red, purple or pink) caused by abnormal blood vessels in or under the skin pigmented birthmarks (usually brown) caused by clusters of pigment cells Vascular birthmarks often occur in the head and neck area, mainly on the face. But both types of birthmark can appear anywhere, including inside the body. If surface blood vessels are affected, a vascular birthmark will appear red, purple or pink. If the affected vessels are deep, the birthmark will appear blue. Pigmented birthmarks are tan or brown-coloured skin marks. Vascular birthmarks Some of the most common types of vascular birthmarks are described below. Salmon patch (stork mark) Salmon patches are flat red or pink patches that can appear on a baby's eyelids, neck or forehead at birth. They're the most common type of vascular birthmark and occur in around half of all babies. Most salmon patches will fade completely within a few months, but if they occur on the forehead they may take up to four years to disappear. Patches on the back of the neck can last longer. Salmon patches are often more noticeable when a baby cries because they fill with blood and become darker. Infantile haemangioma Infantile haemangiomas, also known as strawberry marks, are raised marks on the skin that are usually red. They can appear anywhere on the body. Sometimes infantile haemangiomas occur deeper in the skin, in which case the skin can look blue or purple. Haemangiomas are common, particularly in girls, and affect around 5% of babies soon after birth. They rapidly increase in size for the first six months before eventually shrinking and disappearing by around seven years of age. Haemangiomas that get bigger rapidly, or those that interfere with vision or feeding, may need to be treated. Capillary malformation (port wine stain) Capillary malformation, also known as port wine stains, are flat red or purple marks that affect a very small number of newborn babies. They can vary in size, from a few millimetres to several centimetres in diameter. Port wine stains often affect one side of the body and usually occur on the face, chest and back (although they can occur anywhere). They tend to be sensitive to hormones and may become more noticeable around puberty, pregnancy and the menopause. Most are permanent and may deepen in colour over time. Pigmented birthmarks Some of the most common types of pigmented birthmarks are described below. Café-au-lait spots Café-au-lait spots are coffee-coloured skin patches. Many children have one or two, but if more than six have developed by the time the child is five, you should see your GP. It could be a sign of neurofibromatosis (a number of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along the nerves). Mongolian spots Mongolian spots are blue-grey or bruised-looking birthmarks that are present from birth. They're more commonly seen in darker-skinned people and usually occur over the lower back or buttocks. However, they can also appear elsewhere on the body or limbs. Mongolian spots may last for months or years, but they usually disappear by the time a child reaches four years of age. They're completely harmless and don't need treatment. They may sometimes be mistaken for a bruise. Congenital melanocytic naevi Congenital melanocytic naevi are also known as congenital moles. They're relatively large brown or black moles that are present from birth. They're fairly common and are caused by an overgrowth of pigment cells in the skin. Most congenital melanocytic naevi become proportionally smaller and less obvious with time, although they may darken during puberty or become bumpy or hairy. They can range in size from less than 1.5cm (about 0.6 inches) to more than 20cm (about 7.9 inches) in diameter. The risk of a naevi developing into skin cancer is low, but the risk increases the larger it is. What causes birthmarks? It's not fully understood why birthmarks occur, but they're not usually inherited. Vascular birthmarks are caused by abnormal blood vessels in or under the skin, and pigmented birthmarks are caused by clusters of pigment cells. Port wine stains are thought to occur because the nerves that control the widening or narrowing of the capillaries (tiny blood vessels) don't function properly, or there aren't enough of them. This means that blood is constantly supplied to the skin in that area, which makes it permanently red or purple in colour. Port wine stains are sometimes related to other conditions, such as Sturge-Weber syndrome and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. Read more about the complications associated with birthmarks. Treating birthmarks Most birthmarks are harmless and don't need to be treated. Some types of birthmarks will fade over time, whereas other types such as port wine stains will be permanent if they're not treated. In some cases, a birthmark will need to be treated for medical reasons \u2013 for example, if a haemangioma blocks the airways, affects vision or becomes ulcerated. Some people may also decide to seek treatment for cosmetic reasons.

If you notice bright red blood in your urine, or if your urine has turned red or brown because it has blood in it, see your GP. Sometimes, urine may contain only a small amount of blood invisible to the naked eye and is only apparent when a urine test is carried out for something else. This still needs to be investigated by your doctor, as healthy urine should not contain any detectable amounts of blood. The medical name for blood in the urine is haematuria. If blood in the urine is obvious with the naked eye, it is called \"macroscopic\", or \"visible haematuria\". If the blood can only be detected with laboratory testing, it is called \"microscopic\", or \"non-visible\". The blood will have come from somewhere within the urinary tract \u2013 the kidneys, bladder or the tubes that urine passes through. It is often the result of a urinary tract infection (UTI), such as cystitis. This page outlines the most common reasons for blood in the urine, to give you an idea of what may be causing the problem. However, this guide should not be used to self-diagnose your condition, and it's important to see your GP for a proper diagnosis. Is there definitely blood in your urine? Before you read on, it's worth considering whether you have recently eaten beetroot, as this can colour the urine pink and cause unnecessary alarm. Some medicines, such as the antibiotics nitrofurantoin and rifampicin, can also turn your urine red or brown. Check that the blood is actually coming from your urine and not your vagina (if you're a woman) or back passage. Common causes of blood in urine These include: a bladder infection (such as cystitis) \u2013 which typically also causes a burning pain when you urinate a kidney infection \u2013 which may also cause a high temperature and pain in the side of your tummy kidney stones \u2013 which may be painless, but can sometimes block one of the tubes coming from your kidneys and cause severe tummy pain urethritis \u2013 inflammation of the tube that carries urine out of the body (urethra); it's often caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia an enlarged prostate gland \u2013 this is a common condition in older men and nothing to do with prostate cancer; an enlarged prostate gland will press on the bladder and may also cause problems such as difficulty urinating and a frequent need to urinate bladder cancer \u2013 this usually affects adults aged over 50 and can also cause you to urinate more often and more urgently, as well as pain when urinating kidney cancer \u2013 this also usually affects adults aged over 50, and can cause persistent pain below your ribs and a lump in your tummy prostate cancer \u2013 this is usually only seen in men aged over 50 and usually progresses very slowly; other symptoms can include needing to urinate more frequently and urgently, and difficulty emptying your bladder You can read more about these conditions by clicking on the above links. Seeing your GP Your GP will ask about your symptoms and carry out a physical examination to help determine the cause of the blood in your urine. For men, this may include a rectal examination and women may have a vaginal examination. They will also arrange blood\/and or urine tests to look for signs of an infection. If they think that an infection is likely, they may prescribe some antibiotics before you get your results and will refer you to a specialist if your test results later show you don't have an infection. In some cases, your GP may recommend keeping an eye on your symptoms to see if they get better on their own over time. Referral to a specialist Your GP should refer you urgently to a specialist if any of the following apply: you have visible blood in your urine and no pain, and tests show there is no infection you are 40 or over and keep getting UTIs and blood in your urine you are 50 or over and a urine test picks up unexplained non-visible blood in your urine you have a lump in your tummy (a possible tumour) that was picked up during physical examination by your doctor or during a scan non-visible haematuria is picked up during a test, particularly if there is also protein found in the urine You will be referred to a hospital urology or nephrology department, or a specialist haematuria clinic, for further tests to identify the cause of your symptoms. These tests may include more blood and urine tests, an ultrasound scan, an X-ray and a cystoscopy. This is a procedure used to examine the inside of the bladder, using an instrument called a cystoscope.

The excess levels of iron can then trigger symptoms such as: feeling very tired all the time (fatigue) joint pain in men \u2013 inability to get or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction) in women \u2013 absent periods Read more about symptoms of haemochromatosis. What causes haemochromatosis? Haemochromatosis is an inherited condition caused by a faulty gene called HFE, that allows a person to absorb too much iron from food. Normally, the body only absorbs as much as it needs. The excess iron starts building up in the body and causing problems. Read more about the causes of haemochromatosis. Complications If haemochromatosis is left untreated, the extra iron accumulates in the body, usually in organs, such as the heart and liver. This can lead to potentially serious complications such as: liver disease \u2013 including scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) or liver cancer heart failure \u2013 where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body Read more about complications of haemochromatosis. Treatment Haemochromatosis responds well to treatment, which aims to remove excess iron from the body. The usual treatment is quite simple. Blood is removed from the body on a regular basis \u2013 about the same amount taken in a blood donation, around 500ml (roughly a pint). This leads to an overall drop in iron levels. For people unable to use phlebotomy for medical reasons, a medication called deferasirox can be used as an alternative. This is known as chelation therapy. Read more about treating haemochromatosis. Screening Routine screening for haemochromatosis is not offered by the NHS because it's a relatively uncommon condition. However, if a close family member (a parent, brother or sister) is diagnosed with haemochromatosis you may want to consider getting tested for the condition yourself. Initial screening is done by blood test. Read more about diagnosing haemochromatosis. Living with haemochromatosis Most people will be able to keep their haemochromatosis symptoms under control, but there are steps that can be taken to keep iron levels low and prevent complications. For example: avoid taking iron supplements and eating foods fortified with iron, such as breakfast cereals reduce the amount of vitamin C you consume, as this increases absorption of iron and helps it deposit in some organs avoid drinking too much alcohol, especially with meals, as this can increase iron absorption and cause liver disease \u2013 if you do have some degree of liver disease you may be advised to avoid alcohol completely Who is affected Haemochromatosis is uncommon in general terms, although it's one of the most common genetic (inherited) conditions in England. As many as one person in 200 may be affected. Symptoms usually start in adults between the ages of 30-50. Symptoms in women are often delayed because their iron levels are reduced when they have a period. Haemochromatosis is most common in people of white European ethnic background \u2013 particularly people of Irish descent. Information about you If you have haemochromatosis, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Alan was 55 when he was diagnosed with haemochromatosis or iron overload disorder \u2013 a condition where the body contains too much iron. He describes how he learned to manage the condition by changing his diet and having venesection treatment several times a year. Media last reviewed: 20\/05\/2016 Next review due: 20\/05\/2018 Role of iron in the body The main role of iron in the body is to help transport oxygen in the blood to vital organs. Iron combines with a protein in red blood cells to form a substance called haemoglobin. When we breathe in, the oxygen in our lungs is attracted to the iron in haemoglobin and combines with it to form oxyhaemoglobin. This is transported around the body by blood cells, and oxygen released wherever needed. Iron overload Having too much iron in your body is known as iron overload. Causes of iron overload other than haemochromatosis include: the blood disorder thalassaemia chronic liver disease having a condition that requires frequent blood transfusion, such as sickle cell anaemia drinking beer brewed in iron containers  excess iron intake from iron pills or injections long-term dialysis rare inherited diseases that affect red blood cells, such as atransferrinaemia or aceruloplasminaemia Page last reviewed: 29\/07\/2014 Next review due: 29\/11\/2016 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Normally, when you cut yourself, substances in the blood known as clotting factors combine with blood cells called platelets to make the blood sticky. This makes the bleeding stop eventually. However, in haemophilia, there aren't as many clotting factors as there should be in the blood. This means that someone with the condition bleeds for longer than usual. The condition is passed to a child by one or both of their parents. Read more about the causes of haemophilia. How it affects you The symptoms of haemophilia can be mild to severe, depending on the level of clotting factors you have. Most cases are mild, but people with severe haemophilia experience symptoms, which require ongoing care. People with severe haemophilia often experience internal bleeding. This usually occurs around the joints and muscles, causing pain and stiffness. It can also lead to joint damage over time. Read more about the symptoms of haemophilia and complications of haemophilia. Types of haemophilia The two most common types of haemophilia are haemophilia A and haemophilia B, although haemophilia A accounts for the majority of cases. Both types have the same symptoms, but they're caused by problems with different clotting factors and have slightly different treatments. There's also a rarer form of haemophilia called acquired haemophilia. This isn't an inherited condition, but is caused by the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) attacking the clotting factors in the blood. These pages are about haemophilia A and B. Who is affected? There are about 6,000 people with haemophilia in the UK. Most of these are males because of the way the condition is inherited. Worldwide, it's estimated that one boy in every 5,000 will be born with haemophilia A and one boy in every 30,000 will be born with haemophilia B. However, some females who carry the haemophilia gene may also experience some bleeding problems, such as heavy periods. There's also the chance that a girl could be born with haemophilia if both parents have the haemophilia gene. If you have a family history of haemophilia, you can have tests before, during and after pregnancy to determine if your child has the condition. If there's no family history, haemophilia tends to be diagnosed when symptoms appear in childhood. Read more about diagnosing haemophilia. Treating haemophilia Although there's no cure for haemophilia, treatment usually allows a person with the condition to enjoy a good quality of life. In recent decades, genetically engineered clotting factor medications have been developed to prevent and treat prolonged bleeding. These medications are given as an injection, the timing of which depends on how severe the condition is. Injections are usually only given in milder cases in response to prolonged bleeding, whereas more severe cases are treated with regular injections to prevent bleeding. Read more about treating haemophilia. Your local haemophilia centre People with haemophilia should register at their local haemophilia centre, as this is a useful source of advice and support.

Hib infections used to be a serious health problem in the UK, but the routine immunisation against Hib, given to infants since 1992, means these infections are now rare. Of the small number of cases that do occur nowadays, most affect adults with long-term (chronic) underlying medical conditions, rather than young children. Problems caused by Hib Hib bacteria can cause several serious infections, including: meningitis \u2013 infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord septicaemia \u2013 blood poisoning pneumonia \u2013 infection of the lungs  pericarditis \u2013 infection of the lining surrounding the heart  epiglottitis \u2013 infection of the epiglottis, the flap that covers the entrance to your windpipe  septic arthritis \u2013 infection of the joints cellulitis \u2013 infection of the skin and underlying tissues  osteomyelitis \u2013 infection of the bones Many children who develop Hib infections become very ill and need treatment with antibiotics in hospital. Meningitis is the most severe illness caused by Hib. Even with treatment, 1 in every 20 children with Hib meningitis will die. Those who survive may have long-term problems, such as hearing loss, seizures and learning disabilities. How Hib is spread Hib bacteria can live in the nose and throat of healthy people, and usually don't cause any symptoms. The bacteria are usually spread in a similar way to cold and flu viruses, through infected droplets of fluid in coughs and sneezes. The bacteria can be spread by healthy people who carry the bacteria, as well as those who are ill with a Hib infection. Inhaling the infected droplets or transferring them into your mouth from a contaminated surface can allow the bacteria to spread further into your body, causing one of the infections mentioned above. Hib vaccination Vaccinating children against Hib has been very effective in cutting rates of Hib infections. From more than 800 confirmed cases a year in England in the early 1990s, the number of Hib infections has now fallen to fewer than 20 cases a year. The Hib vaccine is routinely offered to babies as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.  Babies have three separate doses of Hib vaccine \u2013 at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age \u2013 as part of the combined 5-in-1 vaccination. A booster dose is also offered when a child is one year old as part of the combined Hib\/MenC booster to provide longer-term protection.

This timetable has been worked out to give children the best chance of developing immunity against common, but potentially deadly, diseases. When to start childhood vaccinations Routine childhood vaccinations start when a baby is eight weeks old. This is a good age to start vaccinations, because the natural immunity to illness that newborn babies get from their mother is beginning to wear off. If a vaccine is given before eight weeks of age, the baby\u2019s natural immunity to disease may stop it from working. That's why you should ideally have your child vaccinated at the recommended time. Any delay can leave your baby unprotected against illnesses that are often more common and worse in younger children. Vaccinations for premature babies Babies who are born early can have a greater risk of catching infections than babies born on time. This is because their immune systems are less developed and they don\u2019t receive as much natural immunity from their mothers. It\u2019s especially important that premature babies get their vaccines on time, from eight weeks after birth, no matter how premature they are. It may seem very early to give a vaccination to such a tiny baby, but many scientific studies have shown that it\u2019s a good time to give them vaccines. Postponing vaccination until they're older leaves them vulnerable to diseases. If your baby was born very prematurely (before 26 weeks of pregnancy), they may still be in hospital when their first vaccinations are due. In this case, your baby will receive their first vaccines in hospital. Read this NHS leaflet on vaccinations for premature babies (PDF, 221kb). Booster jabs Some vaccines are given more than once. A gap is left between these vaccine doses to make sure that each one has time to work properly. However, the recommended gap is only a minimum. If the gap is longer \u2013 because you missed an appointment, for example \u2013 you don\u2019t have to start the course again. Vaccination timings The NHS childhood vaccination schedule tells you when each routine vaccination should be given. It normally starts when your baby is eight weeks old and is completed by the time they're 18. Other non-routine vaccines may be needed throughout childhood, such as travel vaccines or vaccines for children with certain medical conditions.

Many deaths could be prevented if first aid is given before emergency services arrive. What to do If someone is injured you should: first check that you and the casualty aren't in any danger, and, if possible, make the situation safe if necessary, dial 999 or 112 for an ambulance when it's safe to do so carry out basic first aid Read more about what to do after an incident. If someone is unconscious and breathing If a person is unconscious but breathing, and has no other injuries that would stop them being moved, place them in the recovery position until help arrives. Keep them under observation to ensure they continue to breathe normally, and don't obstruct their airway. If someone is unconscious and not breathing If a person isn't breathing normally after an incident, call an ambulance and start CPR straight away. Use hands-only CPR if you aren't trained to perform rescue breaths. Read more about CPR, including instructions and a video about hands-only CPR. Common accidents and emergencies Below, in alphabetical order, are some of the most common injuries that need emergency treatment in the UK and information about how to deal with them: anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) bleeding burns and scalds   choking  drowning  electric shock (domestic)  fractures  heart attack  poisoning  shock  stroke Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) is a severe allergic reaction that can occur after an insect sting or after eating certain foods. The adverse reaction can be very fast, occurring within seconds or minutes of coming into contact with the substance the person is allergic to (allergen). During anaphylactic shock, it may be difficult for the person to breathe, as their tongue and throat may swell, obstructing their airway. Call 999 or 112 immediately if you think someone is experiencing anaphylactic shock. Check if the person is carrying any medication. Some people who know they have severe allergies may carry an adrenaline self-injector, which is a type of pre-loaded syringe. You can either help the person administer their medication or, if you're trained to do so, give it to them yourself. After the injection, continue to look after the person until medical help arrives. All casualties who have had an intramuscular or subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of adrenaline must be seen and medically checked by a healthcare professional as soon as possible after the injection has been given. Make sure they're comfortable and can breathe as best they can while waiting for medical help to arrive. If they're conscious, sitting upright is normally the best position for them. Read more about treating anaphylaxis. Bleeding If someone is bleeding heavily, the main aim is to prevent further blood loss and minimise the effects of shock (see below). First, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance as soon as possible. If you have disposable gloves, use them to reduce the risk of any infection being passed on. Check that there's nothing embedded in the wound. If there is, take care not to press down on the object. Instead, press firmly on either side of the object and build up padding around it before bandaging, to avoid putting pressure on the object itself. If nothing is embedded: apply and maintain pressure to the wound with your gloved hand, using a clean pad or dressing if possible; continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops  use a clean dressing to bandage the wound firmly if bleeding continues through the pad, apply pressure to the wound  until the bleeding stops and then apply another pad over the top and bandage it in place; don't remove the original pad or dressing, but continue to check that the bleeding has stopped  If a body part, such as a finger, has been severed, place it in a plastic bag or wrap it in cling film and make sure it goes with the casualty to hospital. Always seek medical help for bleeding unless it's minor. If someone has a nosebleed that hasn't stopped after 20 minutes, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Read more about how to treat minor bleeding from cuts and grazes and how to treat nosebleeds. Haemostatic dressings and tourniquets In certain situations, where bleeding is very severe and from the body\u2019s extremities, such as the head, neck and torso, it may be appropriate to use haemostatic dressings or a tourniquet. Haemostatic dressings contain properties that help the blood to clot (thicken) quicker. A tourniquet is a band that's wrapped tightly around a limb to stop blood loss. Haemostatic dressings and tourniquets should only be used by people who have been trained to apply them. Burns and scalds If someone has a burn or scald: cool the burn as quickly as possible with cool running water for at least 10 minutes, or until the pain is relieved call 999 or seek medical help, if needed while cooling the burn, carefully remove any clothing or jewellery, unless it's attached to the skin if you're cooling a large burnt area, particularly in babies, children and elderly people, be aware that it may cause hypothermia (it may be necessary to stop cooling the burn to avoid hypothermia)  cover the burn loosely with cling film; if cling film isn't available, use a clean, dry dressing or non-fluffy material; don't wrap the burn tightly, because swelling may lead to further injury don't apply creams, lotions or sprays to the burn For chemical burns, wear protective gloves, remove any affected clothing, and rinse the burn with cool running water for at least 20 minutes to wash out the chemical. If possible, determine the cause of the injury. In certain situations where a chemical is regularly handled, a specific chemical antidote may be available to use. Be careful not to contaminate and injure yourself with the chemical, and wear protective clothing if necessary. Call 999 or 112 for immediate medical help. Read more about how to treat burns and scalds. Choking The information below is for choking in adults and children over one year old. Read what to do if a baby under one year old is choking. Mild choking If the airway is only partly blocked, the person will usually be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe. In situations like this, a person will usually be able to clear the blockage themselves. If choking is mild: encourage the person to cough to try to clear the blockage ask them to try to spit out the object if it\u2019s in their mouth don't put your fingers in their mouth to help them because they may accidentally bite you If coughing doesn\u2019t work, start back blows (see below). Severe choking  If choking is severe, the person won\u2019t be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe, and without help they\u2019ll eventually become unconscious. To help an adult or child over one year old: Stand behind the person and slightly to one side. Support their chest with one hand. Lean the person forward so that the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down. Give up to five sharp blows between the person\u2019s shoulder blades with the heel of your hand (the heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist). Check if the blockage has cleared. If not, give up to five abdominal thrusts (see below). Abdominal thrusts shouldn't be used on babies under one year old, pregnant women or obese people. To perform abdominal thrusts on a person who is severely choking and isn\u2019t in one of the above groups: Stand behind the person who is choking. Place your arms around their waist and bend them well forward. Clench one fist and place it just above the person's belly button. Place your other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards. Repeat this up to five times. The aim is to get the obstruction out with each chest thrust, rather than necessarily doing all five. If the obstruction doesn't clear after three cycles of back blows and chest thrusts, dial 999 or 112 to ask for an ambulance, and continue until help arrives. The person choking should always be seen by a healthcare professional afterwards to check for any injuries or small pieces of the obstruction that remain. Drowning If someone is in difficulty in water, don't enter the water to help unless it's absolutely essential. Once the person is on land, if they're not breathing, open the airway and give five initial rescue breaths before starting CPR. If you're alone, perform CPR for one minute before calling for emergency help. Find out how to give CPR, including rescue breaths. If the person is unconscious but still breathing, put them into the recovery position with their head lower than their body and call an ambulance immediately. Continue to observe the casualty to ensure they don't stop breathing or that their airway becomes obstructed. Electric shock (domestic) If someone has had an electric shock, switch off the electrical current at the mains to break the contact between the person and the electrical supply. If you can't reach the mains supply: don't go near or touch the person until you're sure the electrical supply has been switched off   once the power supply has been switched off, and if the person isn't breathing, dial 999 or 112 to for an ambulance Afterwards, seek medical help - unless the electric shock is very minor. Fractures It can be difficult to tell if a person has a broken bone or a joint, as opposed to a simple muscular injury. If you're in any doubt, treat the injury as a broken bone. If the person is unconscious, has difficulty breathing or is bleeding severely, these must be dealt with first, by controlling the bleeding with direct pressure and performing CPR. If the person is conscious, prevent any further pain or damage by keeping the fracture as still as possible until you get them safely to hospital. Assess the injury and decide whether the best way to get them to hospital is by ambulance or car. For example, if the pain isn\u2019t too severe, you could transport them to hospital by car. It's always best to get someone else to drive, so that you can deal with the casualty if they deteriorate \u2013 for example, if they lose consciousness as a result of the pain or start to vomit. However, if: they\u2019re in a lot of pain and in need of strong painkilling medication, don't move them and call an ambulance it's obvious they have a broken leg, don't move them, but keep them in the position you found them in and call an ambulance you suspect they have injured or broken their back, don't move them and call an ambulance Don't give the casualty anything to eat or drink, because they may need an anaesthetic (numbing medication) when they reach hospital. You can read more about specific broken bones in the following pages:  broken ankle broken arm or wrist broken collarbone broken nose broken toe fractured ribs hip fracture Heart attack A heart attack is one of the most common life-threatening heart conditions in the UK. If you think a person is having, or has had, a heart attack, sit them down and make them as comfortable as possible, and call 999 or 112 for an ambulance. Symptoms of a heart attack include: chest pain \u2013 the pain is usually located in the centre or left side of the chest and can feel like a sensation of pressure, tightness or squeezing pain in other parts of the body \u2013 it can feel as if the pain is travelling from the chest down one or both arms, or into the jaw, neck, back or abdomen (tummy)  Sit the person down and make them comfortable. If they're conscious, reassure them and ask them to take a 300mg aspirin tablet to chew slowly (unless you know they shouldn't take aspirin \u2013 for example, if they're under 16 or allergic to it). If the person has any medication for angina, such as a spray or tablets, help them to take it. Monitor their vital signs, such as breathing, until help arrives. If the person deteriorates and becomes unconscious, open their airway, check their breathing and, if necessary, start CPR. Re-alert the emergency services that the casualty is now in cardiac arrest. Poisoning Poisoning is potentially life-threatening. Most cases of poisoning in the UK happen when a person has swallowed a toxic substance, such as bleach, taken an overdose of a prescription medication, or eaten wild plants and fungi. Alcohol poisoning can cause similar symptoms. If you think someone has swallowed a poisonous substance, call 999 or 112 to get immediate medical help and advice. The effects of poisoning depend on the substance swallowed, but can include vomiting, loss of consciousness, pain or a burning sensation. The following advice is important: Find out what's been swallowed, so you can tell the paramedic or doctor. Do not give the person anything to eat or drink unless a healthcare professional advises you to. Do not try to cause vomiting. Stay with the person, because their condition may get worse and they could become unconscious. If the person becomes unconscious while you're waiting for help to arrive, check for breathing and, if necessary, perform CPR. Don't perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if the casualty's mouth or airway is contaminated with the poison. Don't leave them if they're unconscious because they may roll onto their back, which could cause them to vomit. The vomit could then enter their lungs and make them choke. If the casualty is conscious and breathing normally, put them into the recovery position and continue to monitor their conscious state and breathing. Read more about treating someone who's been poisoned and treating alcohol poisoning. Shock In the case of a serious injury or illness, it's important to look out for signs of shock (see below). Shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the circulatory system fails to provide enough oxygenated blood to the body and, as a result, deprives the vital organs of oxygen. This is usually due to severe blood loss, but it can also occur after severe burns, severe vomiting, a heart attack, bacterial infection or a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). The type of shock described here isn't the same as the emotional response of feeling shocked, which can also occur after an accident. Signs of shock include: pale, cold, clammy skin sweating rapid, shallow breathing weakness and dizziness feeling sick and possibly vomiting thirst yawning sighing Seek medical help immediately if you notice that someone has any of the above signs of shock. If they do, you should: dial 999 or 112 as soon as possible and ask for an ambulance treat any obvious injuries lie the person down if their injuries allow you to and, if possible, raise and support their legs use a coat or blanket to keep them warm don't give them anything to eat or drink give them lots of comfort and reassurance monitor the person \u2013 if they stop breathing, start CPR and re-alert the emergency services Stroke The FAST guide is the most important thing to remember when dealing with people who have had a stroke. The earlier they receive treatment, the better. Call for emergency medical help straight away. If you think a person has had a stroke, use the FAST guide: Facial weakness \u2013 is the person unable to smile evenly, or are their eyes or mouth droopy? Arm weakness \u2013 is the person only able to raise one arm? Speech problems \u2013 is the person unable to speak clearly or understand you? Time to call 999 or 112 \u2013 for emergency help if a person has any of these symptoms Read more about the symptoms of a stroke. Getting help in an emergency In the UK, 999 has been the emergency services number for many years. However, you can now also call 112 to get help, which is the single emergency telephone number for the EU. This number will give you access to the emergency services wherever you are in the EU. When you call 999 or 112, you'll be asked what service you need, as well as: your telephone number the address you're calling from  a brief description of what's wrong with the casualty and whether they're bleeding, unconscious or not breathing The call handler may advise you on how to assist the casualty until help arrives.

It's a very serious condition and can be fatal. Subarachnoid haemorrhages account for around 1 in every 20 strokes in the UK. Symptoms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage There are usually no warning signs but a subarachnoid haemorrhage sometimes happens during physical effort or straining \u2013 such as coughing, going to the toilet, lifting something heavy or having sex. The main symptoms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage include: a sudden agonising headache \u2013 which is often described as being similar to a sudden hit on the head, resulting in a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before a stiff neck feeling and being sick sensitivity to light (photophobia) blurred or double vision stroke-like symptoms \u2013 such as slurred speech and weakness on one side of the body loss of consciousness or convulsions (uncontrollable shaking) A subarachnoid haemorrhage is a medical emergency. Dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you, or someone in your care, has these symptoms. How a subarachnoid haemorrhage is treated A person with a suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage needs a computerised tomography (CT) scan in hospital to check for signs of bleeding around the brain. If a diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage is confirmed or strongly suspected, you're likely to be transferred to a specialist neurosciences unit. Medication will usually be given to help prevent short-term complications (see below) and a procedure to repair the source of the bleeding may be carried out. Read more about:  diagnosing a subarachnoid haemorrhage treating a subarachnoid haemorrhage What causes subarachnoid haemorrhages? The majority of subarachnoid haemorrhages are caused by a brain aneurysm bursting. A brain aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel, caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall. It's not known exactly why brain aneurysms develop in some people. However, certain risk factors have been identified, including: smoking high blood pressure excessive alcohol consumption Less common causes of subarachnoid haemorrhages include having abnormally developed blood vessels and inflammation of blood vessels in the brain. Severe head injuries often cause subarachnoid bleeding, but this is a separate problem known as a \"traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage\". Read more about the causes of subarachnoid haemorrhages. Who's affected? Between April 2013 and April 2014, more than 6,000 people were admitted to hospitals in England with a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Subarachnoid haemorrhages can happen at any age but they're most common in people aged between 45 and 70. Slightly more women are affected than men. Subarachnoid haemorrhages are also more common in black people compared to other ethnic groups. This could be because black people are more likely to have high blood pressure. Read more about black health issues. Reducing your risk It's not always possible to prevent a subarachnoid haemorrhage, but there are some things you can do to reduce your risk. The three most effective steps you can take to reduce your chances of having a subarachnoid haemorrhage are: stop smoking \u2013 your GP can refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking Service for help and advice or you can call the NHS Smoking Helpline on 0300 123 1044 moderate your alcohol consumption take steps to prevent high blood pressure \u2013 such as regular exercise, eating a healthy diet and losing weight if you're overweight Possible complications A subarachnoid haemorrhage can cause both short and long-term complications. Serious short-term complications can include further bleeding at the site of any aneurysm and brain damage caused by a reduction in blood supply to the brain. Long-term complications include: epilepsy \u2013 where a person has repeated seizures (fits) problems with certain mental functions, such as memory, planning and concentration changes in mood, such as depression Read more about the complications of a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Outlook Although the outlook for subarachnoid haemorrhage has improved in the last few decades, around half of all cases are fatal, and people who survive can be left with long-term problems. Recovering after a subarachnoid haemorrhage can also be a slow and frustrating process, and it's common to have problems such as: extreme tiredness headaches problems sleeping Read more about recovering from a subarachnoid haemorrhage.

In many cases, haemorrhoids don't cause symptoms, and some people don't even realise they have them. However, when symptoms do occur, they may include: bleeding after passing a stool (the blood is usually bright red) itchy bottom a lump hanging down outside of the anus, which may need to be pushed back in after passing a stool a mucus discharge after passing a stool soreness, redness and swelling around your anus Haemorrhoids aren't usually painful, unless their blood supply slows down or is interrupted. When to seek medical advice See your GP if you have persistent or severe symptoms of haemorrhoids. You should always get any rectal bleeding checked out, so your doctor can rule out more potentially serious causes. The symptoms of haemorrhoids often clear up on their own or with simple treatments that can be bought from a pharmacy without a prescription (see below). However, speak to your GP if your symptoms don't get better or if you experience pain or bleeding. Your GP can often diagnose haemorrhoids using a simple internal examination of your back passage, although they may need to refer you to a colorectal specialist for diagnosis and treatment. Some people with haemorrhoids are reluctant to see their GP. However, there\u2019s no need to be embarrassed, because GPs are very used to diagnosing and treating haemorrhoids. Read more about diagnosing haemorrhoids. What causes haemorrhoids? The exact cause of haemorrhoids is unclear, but they're associated with increased pressure in the blood vessels in and around your anus. This pressure can cause the blood vessels in your back passage to become swollen and inflamed. Many cases are thought to be caused by too much straining on the toilet, due to prolonged constipation \u2013 this is often due to a lack of fibre in a person's diet. Chronic (long-term) diarrhoea can also make you more vulnerable to getting haemorrhoids. Other factors that might increase your risk of developing haemorrhoids include: being overweight or obese age \u2013 as you get older, your body's supporting tissues get weaker, increasing your risk of haemorrhoids being pregnant \u2013 which can place increased pressure on your pelvic blood vessels, causing them to enlarge (read more about piles in pregnancy) having a family history of haemorrhoids regularly lifting heavy objects a persistent cough or repeated vomiting sitting down for long periods of time Preventing and treating haemorrhoids  Haemorrhoid symptoms often settle down after a few days, without needing treatment. Haemorrhoids that occur during pregnancy often get better after giving birth. However, making lifestyle changes to reduce the strain on the blood vessels in and around your anus is often recommended. These can include: gradually increasing the amount of fibre in your diet \u2013 good sources of fibre include fruit, vegetables, wholegrain rice, wholewheat pasta and bread, pulses and beans, seeds, nuts and oats drinking plenty of fluid \u2013 particularly water, but avoiding or cutting down on caffeine and alcohol not delaying going to the toilet \u2013 ignoring the urge to empty your bowels can make your stools harder and drier, which can lead to straining when you do go to the toilet avoiding medication that causes constipation \u2013 such as painkillers that contain codeine losing weight (if you're overweight) exercising regularly \u2013 can help prevent constipation, reduce your blood pressure and help you lose weight These measures can also reduce the risk of haemorrhoids returning, or even developing in the first place. Medication that you apply directly to your back passage (known as topical treatments) or tablets bought from a pharmacy or prescribed by your GP may ease your symptoms and make it easier for you to pass stools. There are various treatment options for more severe haemorrhoids. One of these options is banding, which is a non-surgical procedure where a very tight elastic band is put around the base of the haemorrhoid to cut off its blood supply. The haemorrhoid should fall off after about a week. Surgery carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're unconscious) is sometimes used to remove or shrink large or external haemorrhoids.

It's important to be aware of this risk, and know what to do. Reactions to hair dye are avoidable if you follow some simple safety advice. This page offers advice to anyone who uses permanent or semi-permanent hair dye, especially the darker-coloured dyes.  It explains: why some people are sensitive to hair dye  how to avoid a reaction signs and symptoms of a hair dye reaction  what to do if you have a reaction  Why some people are sensitive to hair dye Some people are prone to a skin reaction called contact dermatitis. This means their skin becomes inflamed (red, dry and irritated) when they come into contact with a particular substance. The substance may either be an irritant, directly damaging the skin, or an allergen, triggering an allergic reaction that affects the skin. Many permanent and some semi-permanent hair dyes contain a chemical called paraphenylenediamine (PPD), which is a known irritant and allergen. This is the culprit of most reactions to hair dye. Is PPD safe? Hair dyes containing PPD are safe to use, providing safety instructions are followed. These products are strictly regulated and there's a maximum limit to the amount of PPD the product can contain. If you ignore the safety instructions that come with the dye, you could put yourself at risk of a serious reaction. You're particularly at risk if you have (or have previously had) a black henna tattoo. These temporary tattoos should be avoided because the paste often contains toxic levels of PPD, which can sensitise you to the chemical. This means your immune system has \"remembered\" the chemical and will launch a defence reaction the next time you're exposed to it. So, you could develop a life-threatening allergic reaction when you next use PPD hair dye.  Learn more about the dangers of black henna tattoos. How to avoid a reaction to hair dye Patch test Always carry out a patch test before using a permanent or semi-permanent hair dye, even if you are using your regular brand. This usually involves dabbing a small amount of the dye solution behind your ear or on your inner elbow and leaving it to dry. Follow the instructions that come with the dye. If you develop any irritation or feel unwell after the patch test, don't use the product. You should be able to return the product to the shop for a full refund. Allergy clinic You could also have a patch test done at an allergy clinic, to see which chemicals (if any) you're sensitive to. You can then check product labels and avoid products containing these chemicals. However, the clinic may not test all hair dye chemicals. Other precautions If you don't develop any reaction from the patch test, you can continue to use the dye, but make sure you: don't leave it on for longer than the recommended time wear gloves when applying the dye rinse your hair thoroughly afterwards carefully follow the instructions included Signs and symptoms of a hair dye reaction Reactions to PPD can range from mild irritation in the scalp to an allergic reaction that can potentially trigger serious symptoms throughout the body. Mild irritation If you're mildly irritated to PPD, you may find that your scalp, neck, forehead, ears and\/or eyelids become irritated and inflamed after using hair dye. The skin exposed to the PPD may become red, swollen, blistered, dry, thickened and cracked. You may feel a burning or stinging sensation. Symptoms will usually appear within 48 hours, although strong irritants may cause your skin to react immediately. Learn more about irritant contact dermatitis. Allergic reaction If you're allergic to PPD, your scalp and face may feel itchy and start to swell. PPD may also trigger symptoms throughout your body, such as itching, a nettle rash, and generally feeling ill. These symptoms may not develop until hours, or even days, later. A severe allergic reaction that develops within minutes is known as anaphylaxis, or \"anaphylactic shock\". Signs of anaphylaxis include: itchy skin or a raised, red skin rash swollen eyes, lips, hands and feet \u2013 the eyelids can swell so much that the eyes close feeling lightheaded or faint swelling of the mouth, throat or tongue, which can cause breathing and swallowing difficulties wheezing tummy pain, nausea and vomiting collapsing and becoming unconscious What to do  Dial 999 for an ambulance if you think anaphylaxis is happening, and give an adrenaline injection if you have one. If you think you're experiencing a reaction to hair dye, but it's not an emergency, follow this advice: Relieving mild symptoms Wash your hair and scalp thoroughly with mild shampoo to remove any excess dye Try gently applying an emollient (moisturising treatment) such as aqueous cream to the affected skin Steroid cream If your skin is very red, sore and inflamed, you may need to try a steroid cream (topical corticosteroid). You can buy mild steroid cream over the counter (speak to your pharmacist for advice) or your GP can prescribe you one. Read more about the treatment of contact dermatitis. Avoiding PPD If you develop a reaction to hair dye, even if it's just a mild one, you should stop using products containing PPD altogether, as there's a risk you could develop a more severe reaction in the future. Try switching to a safer alternative, such as a non-permanent PPD-free hair dye, although it's still possible to develop a reaction to this.

It generally follows a pattern of a receding hairline, followed by thinning of the hair on the crown and temples, leaving a horseshoe shape around the back and sides of the head. Sometimes it can progress to complete baldness, although this is uncommon. Male-pattern baldness is hereditary, which means it runs in families. It's thought to be caused by oversensitive hair follicles, linked to having too much of a certain male hormone. As well as affecting men, it can sometimes affect women (female-pattern baldness). During female-pattern baldness, hair usually only thins on top of the head. It's not clear if female-pattern baldness is hereditary and the causes are less well understood. However, it tends to be more noticeable in women who have been through the menopause (when a woman's periods stop at around age 52), perhaps because they have fewer female hormones. Alopecia areata Alopecia areata causes patches of baldness about the size of a large coin. They usually appear on the scalp but can occur anywhere on the body. It can occur at any age, but mostly affects teenagers and young adults. In most cases of alopecia areata, hair will grow back in a few months. At first, hair may grow back fine and white, but over time it should thicken and regain its normal colour. Some people go on to develop a more severe form of hair loss, such as: alopecia totalis (no scalp hair) alopecia universalis (no hair on the scalp and body) Alopecia areata is caused by a problem with the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness). It's more common among people with other autoimmune conditions, such as an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), diabetes or Down's syndrome. It's also believed some people's genes make them more susceptible to alopecia areata, as one in five people with the condition have a family history of the condition. Alopecia areata can occur at any age, although it's more common in people aged 15-29. It affects one or two people in every 1,000 in the UK. Scarring alopecia  Scarring alopecia, also known as cicatricial alopecia, is usually caused by complications of another condition. In this type of alopecia, the hair follicle (the small hole in your skin that an individual hair grows out of) is completely destroyed. This means your hair won't grow back. Depending on the condition, the skin where the hair has fallen out is likely to be affected in some way. Conditions which can cause scarring alopecia include: scleroderma \u2013 a condition affecting the body's connective (supporting) tissues, resulting in hard, puffy and itchy skin lichen planus \u2013 an itchy rash affecting many areas of the body discoid lupus \u2013 a mild form of lupus affecting the skin, causing scaly marks and hair loss folliculitis decalvans \u2013 a rare form of alopecia that most commonly affects men, causing baldness and scarring of the affected areas frontal fibrosing alopecia \u2013 a type of alopecia that affects post-menopausal women where the hair follicles are damaged, and the hair falls out and is unable to grow back Scarring alopecia occurs in both males and females, but is less common in children than adults. It accounts for about 7% of hair loss cases. Anagen effluvium Anagen effluvium is widespread hair loss that can affect your scalp, face and body. One of the most common causes of this type of hair loss is the cancer treatment chemotherapy. In some cases, other cancer treatments \u2013 including immunotherapy and radiotherapy \u2013 may also cause hair loss. The hair loss is usually noticeable within a few weeks of starting treatment. However, not all chemotherapy drugs cause hair loss and sometimes the hair loss is so small it's hardly noticeable. It may be possible to reduce hair loss from chemotherapy by wearing a special cap that keeps the scalp cool. However, scalp cooling is not always effective and not widely available. In most cases, hair loss in anagen effluvium is temporary. Your hair should start to grow back a few months after chemotherapy has stopped. Telogen effluvium Telogen effluvium is a common type of alopecia where there is widespread thinning of the hair, rather than specific bald patches. Your hair may feel thinner, but you're unlikely to lose it all and your other body hair isn't usually affected. Telogen effluvium can be caused by your body reacting to: hormonal changes, such as those that take place when a woman is pregnant intense emotional stress intense physical stress, such as childbirth a short-term illness, such as a severe infection or an operation a long-term illness, such as cancer or liver disease changes in your diet, such as crash dieting some medications, such as anticoagulants (medicines that reduce the ability of your blood to clot) or beta-blockers (used to treat a number of conditions, such as high blood pressure) In most cases of telogen effluvium, your hair will stop falling out and start to grow back within six months. How is hair loss treated? More common types of hair loss, such as male-pattern baldness, don't need treatment because they're a natural part of ageing and don't pose a risk to your health. However, any type of hair loss can be distressing, so you should see your GP if you're worried about it. Your GP should be able to diagnose your type of hair loss by examining your hair. They can also discuss possible treatments with you so it's advisable to visit your GP before trying a private consultant dermatologist (skin care specialist). If you want treatment for male-pattern baldness for cosmetic reasons, two medications called finasteride and minoxidil can be used. Minoxidil can also be used to treat female-pattern baldness. However, these treatments don't work for everyone and only work for as long as they're continued. They are not available on the NHS and can be expensive. Alopecia areata is usually treated with steroid injections, although it's sometimes possible to use a steroid cream, gel or ointment. A treatment called immunotherapy may also be used. This involves stimulating hair growth by causing an intentional allergic reaction in the affected areas of skin. If you have significant hair loss of any type, you may decide to wear a wig. Wigs are available on the NHS, but you may have to pay unless you qualify for help with charges. There are also some surgical options for hair loss, including a hair transplant and artificial hair implants. Read more about treating hair loss. Emotional issues Hair loss can be difficult to come to terms with. The hair on your head can be a defining part of your identity. If you start to lose your hair, it can feel as if you're losing part of your identity. This can affect your self-confidence and sometimes lead to depression. Speak to your GP if you're finding it difficult to deal with your hair loss. They may suggest counselling. You may also benefit from joining a support group or speaking to other people in the same situation \u2013 for example, through online forums. A number of charities, such as Alopecia UK, have support groups and online forums where you can talk to others who are experiencing hair loss.

This light source heats and destroys hair follicles in the skin, which disrupts hair growth. Common areas to treat are the face, legs, arms, underarms and bikini line. It can be helpful for women with hirsutism (excessive hair growth). Generally, it's most effective on women with pale skin and dark hair, and doesn't work so well on women with dark skin.  Before you go ahead\u2026 Laser hair removal can be expensive, and has its limitations. Cost: In the UK, laser hair removal costs between £40 and £400, depending on the area of skin and number of sessions included. You may be recommended four to six sessions, spaced about four to six weeks apart. Limitations: The results of laser hair removal are not permanent. They usually last from weeks to months, and regular sessions may be needed to achieve and maintain the desired effect. There's no guarantee it will clear all the hair. Safety: Take time to find a reputable practitioner who is properly qualified and practises in a clean, safe and appropriate environment. Ask the practitioner what you should do if something were to go wrong. What it involves You\u2019ll need to shave the area of skin the day before your appointment. On the day, you\u2019ll wear specially designed goggles to protect your eyes during the procedure. Local anaesthetic isn\u2019t necessary. The practitioner usually applies a cool gel or cooling air spray to the area of skin. They then press a hand-held device to your skin and trigger the laser. This may feel like an elastic band snapping at your skin. Each session may take between 15 minutes to over an hour. The number of sessions needed depends on the area to be lasered and the system used.  Afterwards The area may be red with a raised rash for up to 24 hours afterwards. Holding an ice pack to the skin may help (try a pack of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel). Your skin will be more sensitive to the sun after laser hair removal. Avoid sun exposure and tanning beds for at least a week after treatment, and use sunscreen. On rare occasions, laser hair removal can result in: a crust or blister on your skin, which may take up to 10 days to heal  lightening or darkening of the skin for several months afterwards scarring excessive swelling, which may last up to seven days bruising, which may last up to 15 days burns a rare condition called livedo reticularis, where skin becomes mottled a skin reaction called erythema ab igne, caused by prolonged or repeated exposure to the laser or IPL What to do if you have problems If you're not happy with the results or are experiencing problems, take up the matter with your practitioner through the clinic where you were treated. If there are any complications that require medical attention, it is best that you go back to the practitioner who treated you. If this is not possible, you can go to your GP or local accident and emergency (A&E) department.

It is suitable for people with androgenetic alopecia (male- and female-pattern baldness) or scarring resulting from injury or burns. It is not usually appropriate for other types of hair loss, such as alopecia areata. A hair transplant isn't normally available on the NHS, as it is regarded as cosmetic surgery. It is a major decision \u2013 a permanent alteration to your appearance \u2013 so weigh it up carefully and don't rush into anything.

Read on to find out: How much does it cost?  Where do I go?  What does it involve?  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems  More information  How much does it cost? A hair transplant in the UK can cost anywhere between £1,000 and £30,000, depending on the extent of hair loss, the type of procedure you have, and the quality of the clinic and its team. Where do I go? If you're looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform hair transplants.  All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC. The CQC publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. Also, research the surgeon who is going to carry our your hair transplant. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor's fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many transplants they've performed where there have been complications what sort of care would be provided after the operation where the surgeon is based Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? A hair transplant is usually carried out under local anaesthetic and sedation. There are two main ways it can be carried out. Follicular unit transplantation (FUT, or strip method): A strip of hair-bearing skin is removed from the back and sides of the head and divided into individual hair grafts. Each graft contains about two hairs. The grafts are then placed into tiny cuts (incisions) made in the scalp. The wound at the back of the head is closed with stitches. The head does not need to be shaved \u2013 only the area to be removed is trimmed. Follicular unit extraction (FUE): The entire head is usually shaved. A special punch device is used to directly remove individual grafts of hair one by one. The grafts are placed into tiny incisions made in the scalp. Both procedures usually take a full day, but an overnight stay is not required. If a large area is being treated, you may need to have two or more sessions a few months apart. You shouldn't feel pain during a hair transplant. Pain relief will be provided if you experience any discomfort afterwards. The surgeon may give you some lotion or spray to take away and use at home. It's important to follow the instructions you're given when discharged. Recovery You will need to arrange for someone to drive you home if you were given a sedative, as this can take up to 24 hours to wear off. Most patients return to work about three days after their hair transplant procedure. It's usually possible to return to work more quickly following an FUT procedure. The head is not shaved, so your operation may not be noticeable. You should be very careful with your transplanted hair for the first 14 days after your operation. The newly transplanted grafts will not be secure in their new place. After 14 days, you can normally return to your normal hair care routine. Most clinics will ask you to restrict your exercise in the first month to reduce the chances of increased scarring. After a few days: Any bandages can normally be removed. You may be able to wash your hair gently by hand. After a week: Any non-dissolvable stitches can normally be removed. After a few weeks: The transplanted hair will often fall out, and later start to grow back. After six months: New hair will normally start to appear. After 12-18 months: The full results should be seen. Side effects to expect It's common after a hair transplant to have: a tight, achy and swollen scalp for a few days temporary scabbing where the hair was transplanted at least one scar \u2013 although this should fade and is usually only noticeable if your hair is cut very short What could go wrong A hair transplant is generally a safe procedure, but as with any type of operation there's always a small risk of: excessive bleeding infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic or sedation  Your surgeon should be able to treat these problems promptly if they happen. There's also a small risk the transplant won't take and the hair falls out, or an obvious scar develops. The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are and how they would be treated if they occured. If you have male- or female-pattern hair loss, your hair will continue to thin in the areas around the transplant, so it's essential to carefully plan the design of the transplant to make sure the hair remains natural looking as time passes. Occasionally, people find the desired effect wasn't achieved and feel they need another operation. What to do if you have problems Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms. If you have a hair transplant and are not happy with the results, or you think the procedure wasn't carried out properly, you should take up the matter with the surgeon who treated you. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC).

They produce raised red spots, which can sometimes become infected and turn into painful, pus-filled sores. Ingrown hairs can be itchy and embarrassing, but they often go away on their own without doing anything. Anyone can get ingrown hairs, but they tend to be more of a problem in people with coarse or curly hair. This topic covers: What causes ingrown hairs? What to do If there are lots of pus-filled spots Preventing ingrown hairs Other possible skin conditions  What causes ingrown hairs? Ingrown hairs have usually grown out of the skin, curled back round and re-entered the skin. Some curl back into the hair follicle \u2013 small cavities in the skin that hairs grow out of \u2013 without even exiting the skin. An ingrown hair can occur when the hair follicle becomes clogged with dead skin cells. This forces the hair inside it to grow sideways, which is much more likely to happen if the hair is already curly or coarse and it's recently been shaved. Ingrown hairs can be a particular problem in the areas where you shave \u2013 the beard area in men, and the legs, armpits and pubic area in women. In these places, the hair that grows back has a sharper edge and can easily poke back into the skin. Ingrown hairs look like pimples in the skin, and sometimes you can see the hair trapped beneath the skin. The spots can be filled with pus. What to do If possible, you should leave ingrown hairs for a while as they may disappear without you having to do anything.  Don't pick or scratch an ingrown hair as bacteria can enter the small wound created, increasing your risk of infection. It can also cause scarring. You should also avoid squeezing the spots because it can damage the skin and lead to infection. If an ingrown hair is near the surface of your skin, you could use a sterile needle or tweezers to gently tease it out. However, don't dig for the hair if it lies deep below the skin's surface. Men who are prone to getting ingrown hairs around their face may find it best to grow out their beard. Longer hairs aren't as sharp at the ends, so are less likely to become ingrown. If there are lots of pus-filled spots The hair follicles of ingrown hairs can sometimes become infected and inflamed. This is known as folliculitis. The hair follicles will swell into pus-filled spots, although pus doesn't always mean there's an infection. Again, mild cases of folliculitis often clear up without treatment, so try not shaving for a few days and see if it gets better. You could also try dabbing a mild antiseptic, such as tea tree oil, on to the affected area. See your GP if the spots don't improve and are bothering you. If one particular spot is a problem, your GP may be able to release the ingrown hair using a sterile needle. Antibiotics are usually only needed if the skin is severely infected with pustules and abscesses. Preventing ingrown hairs The simplest way to prevent ingrowing hairs is to let your hair grow freely without shaving it. You may want to try this for a brief period if you need relief from particularly bad spots.  If you don't want to stop shaving, the following shaving tips may help: use a sharp, single-bladed razor wet your skin with warm water and use a gel shave in the direction the hairs are growing use as few strokes of the razor as possible rinse the razor after every stroke try not to shave too closely \u2013 leave a bit of stubble if you can, as bacteria can enter the tiny openings of freshly shaved skin Other hair removal methods may be less likely to result in ingrowing hairs. For example, instead of shaving your legs, you may want to try depilatory creams, electrolysis or laser removal. Other possible skin conditions There are many skin conditions that can easily be mistaken for ingrown hairs, including: keratosis pilaris (\"chicken skin\") \u2013 a common, harmless condition where the skin becomes rough and bumpy, as if covered in permanent goose pimples acne  a cyst or abscess eczema  impetigo \u2013 a highly contagious skin infection that mainly affects children  heat rash (prickly heat) pustular psoriasis molluscum contagiosum \u2013 a highly contagious viral infection that affects the skin  See your GP if you're unsure.

It's a problem that mainly affects women. It's relatively common, although some women may find it embarrassing or distressing to live with. It's often a long-term problem, but there are a number of treatments that can help keep it under control. This page covers: Symptoms of hirsutism When to see your GP Treatments for hirsutism Causes of hirsutism Symptoms of hirsutism The excessive hair in hirsutism is usually thick and dark, rather than fine and fair. It develops in areas where men often have hair, such as the: face neck chest tummy lower back buttocks thighs You may also have some additional symptoms, such as oily skin, acne, a deep voice, irregular periods or no periods at all. When to see your GP It's a good idea to see your GP if you have hirsutism. They can look for any underlying cause and advise you about the treatments available. Your GP may: examine the areas of excess hair growth ask about any other symptoms ask about your medical history, such as whether you're taking any medication carry out a blood test to check your hormone levels Depending on what your GP thinks may be causing your symptoms, they may treat you themselves or you may be referred to a specialist. Treatments for hirsutism Treatment for hirsutism usually involves techniques to remove the excess hair and treatment to help slow its growth or stop it coming back. The main treatments are: home hair removal methods \u2013 such as shaving, plucking or waxing specialist hair removal treatments \u2013 such as laser hair removal eflornithine cream \u2013 a prescription cream that can help slow down the growth of facial hair oral contraceptives, including co-cyprindiol tablets \u2013 a type of contraceptive pill available on prescription that can help prevent excess hair growth It may take a few months to notice the effects of treatment, so it's important to persist with it. In many cases, treatment will need to be continued indefinitely. Read more about the treatments for hirsutism. Causes of hirsutism Hirsutism is caused by an excess of male hormones called androgens in your body, or by your body being more sensitive to these hormones. In many cases, it's not clear why this happens. Some women just seem to develop extra hair growth as they get older, particularly after the menopause. In younger women, the most common cause is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition that can cause irregular periods and fluid-filled sacs (cysts) on the ovaries. Less common causes of hirsutism include: Cushing's syndrome \u2013 a hormonal disorder that causes sudden weight gain and bloating around the face and neck congenital adrenal hyperplasia \u2013 an inherited condition affecting the adrenal glands, the glands above the kidneys that produce hormones obesity \u2013 losing weight may help improve the symptoms in these cases acromegaly \u2013 a condition in which the body produces too much growth hormone medicines \u2013 such as anabolic steroids, used by some people to build muscle and improve athletic performance a tumour (growth) \u2013 that increases the production of androgens and usually affects the ovaries or adrenal glands Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 06\/05\/2016 Next review due: 06\/05\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

The condition gets its name from the fine, hair-like strands that develop around the outside of the cancerous cells and are visible under a microscope. It's not known what causes hairy cell leukaemia. Leukaemia Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. All the body's blood cells, including red and white blood cells and platelets, are produced by bone marrow. Bone marrow is a spongy tissue found inside the bones. It also produces special cells called stem cells. In leukaemia, the cancer begins in the stem cells and causes them to produce more white blood cells than are needed. Over time, the build-up of cancerous white blood cells disrupts the normal balance of cells in the blood. This means your body doesn't have enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, or platelets, which help stop bleeding. This can lead to the symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, shortness of breath and feeling faint, as well as increasing the risk of excessive bleeding. Also, as the white blood cells aren't properly developed, they're less effective at fighting bacteria and viruses, making you more vulnerable to infection. Hairy cell leukaemia The symptoms of hairy cell leukaemia develop slowly and are similar to those of other types of leukaemia. They include: weight loss  pale skin weakness, tiredness and breathlessness (due a lack of red blood cells) frequent infections (due to a lack of infection-fighting white blood cells) bleeding or bruising easily pain or swelling in your abdomen (tummy) (see below) The abnormal white blood cells can accumulate in your spleen, causing it to increase in size. The spleen is an organ in the upper left side of your abdomen, behind your stomach and ribs. If your spleen is enlarged, it's likely you'll have a painful lump on the left side of your abdomen. If this is the case, you should visit your GP so the lump can be examined. An enlarged spleen may remove normal blood cells from your bloodstream. This can lead to a further reduction in the number of normal red and white blood cells and platelets in your blood. Diagnosis If your GP suspects leukaemia, they may refer you to a haematologist (a specialist in blood disorders). The haematologist will carry out blood tests to determine how many different types of blood cells there are in your blood sample. This is known as a full blood count (FBC) and will indicate the number of abnormal white blood cells you have. If you have hairy cell leukaemia, it's likely your red blood cell and platelet counts will be low. A bone marrow sample may also be taken which will give the haematologist more detailed information about your condition. An ultrasound scan or a computerised tomography (CT) scan may be needed to examine your spleen. Treatment As hairy cell leukaemia develops slowly, immediate treatment may not be needed. You'll have regular blood tests to monitor your condition. Treatment may be recommended if the number of abnormal white blood cells increases or if you develop symptoms. A number of different treatments are available for hairy cell leukaemia. Chemotherapy is the main treatment and it's usually effective at destroying the cancerous cells. Other treatments are sometimes used in combination with chemotherapy. Rituximab is a type of medication known as a monoclonal antibody. It seeks out a protein found on leukaemia cells and attaches itself to it. The immune system then targets and kills the cells. Interferon is another medicine that can be used to treat hairy cell leukaemia. It can strengthen your immune system and help fight cancer. This type of treatment, known as immunotherapy, may be recommended if you can't have chemotherapy or rituximab, or they're no longer working. Surgery to remove the spleen is rarely used as a treatment for hairy cell leukaemia. However, removal of your spleen may be recommended if: it's enlarged and is causing pain or discomfort it's destroying large numbers of red blood cells or platelets it hasn't shrunk after chemotherapy The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the types of treatment for hairy cell leukaemia. Outlook As with most types of cancer, the outlook for hairy cell leukaemia will depend on how far the condition has advanced at the time of diagnosis and how well it responds to treatment. As hairy cell leukaemia is a rare type of cancer, it's difficult to accurately predict how it will affect individuals in the long-term.  However, according to Cancer Research UK, at least 96 out of 100 people diagnosed with hairy cell leukaemia (96%) will live at least 10 years after being diagnosed. In hairy cell leukaemia the affected blood cells develop hair-like strands on their suface   How common is hairy cell leukaemia? Hairy cell leukaemia is one of the rarest types of leukaemia. In the UK, around 200 people are diagnosed with hairy cell leukaemia each year. The condition most commonly affects people who are 40-60 years of age. It affects men more than women and is very rare in children and teenagers.

Why chemotherapy is used Chemotherapy is used if a cancer has spread or if there's a risk that it will. The main aim of treatment may be: to try to cure cancer completely \u2013 this is known as curative chemotherapy to help make other treatments more effective \u2013 for example, chemotherapy can be combined with radiotherapy (where radiation is used to kill cancerous cells), or it can be used before surgery to reduce the risk of the cancer returning after radiotherapy or surgery  to relieve symptoms \u2013 a cure may not be possible for advanced cancer, but chemotherapy may be used to relieve the symptoms and slow it down; this is known as palliative chemotherapy Less commonly, chemotherapy is used to treat non-cancerous conditions. For example, low doses have been used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. How chemotherapy is used There are many different types of chemotherapy medication, but they all work in much the same way. Depending on the type of cancer you have, you may be treated with one medicine (monotherapy) or with a combination of medicines (combination therapy). There are several ways in which chemotherapy medication can be given, including tablets and injections directly into a vein. The team caring for you will help come up with a treatment plan for your specific circumstances. Read more about how chemotherapy is carried out and who can use chemotherapy. Side effects Even though chemotherapy is often effective at treating cancer or relieving its symptoms, it does cause side effects. The medicines used in chemotherapy can't distinguish between fast-growing cancer cells and other types of fast-growing cells, such as blood cells, skin cells and the cells inside the stomach. This means that most chemotherapy medications have a poisonous effect on the body's cells, causing problems including: feeling tired and weak all the time feeling and being sick  hair loss  Some people only have minimal side effects, but for most people, a course of chemotherapy can be unpleasant and upsetting. Living with and adapting to the side effects of chemotherapy can be challenging. However, it's important to realise that most, if not all, side effects will disappear once the treatment is complete. There is no risk of the side effects of chemotherapy being passed to other people, including children and pregnant women, if they are in close contact with someone having chemotherapy. Read more about the possible side effects of chemotherapy. Targeted therapies In the past, any medication used to treat cancer was regarded as chemotherapy. However, over the last 20 years, new types of medication that work in a different way to chemotherapy have been introduced. These new types of medication are known as targeted therapies. This is because they're designed to target and disrupt one or more of the biological processes that cancerous cells use to grow and reproduce. In contrast, chemotherapy medications are designed to have a poisonous effect on cancerous cells.

About one in four people are thought to have bad breath (halitosis) on a regular basis. What causes bad breath? There are a number of things that can cause bad breath. It's usually the result of poor oral hygiene. If bacteria build up in your mouth, the toxins produced can cause your breath to smell.  Bacteria break down pieces of food in the mouth, and may release an unpleasant-smelling gas. Any food trapped on your teeth \u2013 particularly between them \u2013 is broken down by bacteria, which may cause bad breath. Persistent bad breath can sometimes be a sign of gum disease. Eating strongly flavoured foods, such as onions and garlic, can also cause your breath to smell, as can smoking and drinking alcohol. Occasionally, bad breath can occur after an infection or illness, or as a result of taking certain types of medication. Read more about the causes of bad breath. Treating and preventing bad breath Improving your oral hygiene is usually enough to cure bad breath and stop it happening again. To improve your oral health, make sure you: floss between your teeth daily brush your teeth and gums regularly clean your tongue regularly Read more about treating and preventing bad breath. When to seek medical advice See your dentist, dental hygienist or dental therapist first if you still have bad breath after making changes to improve your dental hygiene. You may also need to visit your GP as there may be a medical cause that needs to be investigated. Don't try to hide the smell of your breath when seeking medical advice as it may make it more difficult to find out what's causing the problem. Do I have bad breath? It's not always easy to tell if you have bad breath. Other people may notice it first, but they could feel uncomfortable telling you. A simple test to find out whether you have bad breath is to lick the inside of your wrist with the back of your tongue and wait a few seconds until the saliva dries. If your wrist smells unpleasant, it's likely your breath does, too.

They're common in people with schizophrenia, and are usually experienced as hearing voices. Hallucinations can be frightening, but there's usually an identifiable cause. For example, they can occur as a result of: taking illegal drugs or alcohol a mental illness, such as schizophrenia or dementia a progressive neurological condition, such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease loss of vision caused by a condition such as macular degeneration \u2013 this is known as Charles Bonnet syndrome See your GP straight away if you're experiencing hallucinations and you're worried about them. Hallucinations can make you feel nervous, paranoid and frightened, so it's important to be with someone you can trust. The following information explains the typical types of hallucinations, including why they occur and what you can do. It covers: hearing voices  drug-induced hallucinations  hallucinations and sleep  hallucinations in children with a fever Charles Bonnet syndrome  hallucinations in older people with delirium  Hallucinations can also occur as a result of extreme tiredness or recent bereavement. However, these and other rarer causes aren't covered here. Hearing voices Hearing voices in the mind is the most common type of hallucination in people with mental health conditions such as schizophrenia. The voices can be critical, complimentary or neutral, and may make potentially harmful commands or engage the person in conversation. They may give a running commentary on the person's actions. Hearing voices is a well-recognised symptom of schizophrenia, dementia or bipolar disorder, but can be unrelated to mental illness. The experience is usually very distressing, but it's not always negative. Some people who hear voices are able to live with them and get used to them, or may consider them a part of their life.  It's not uncommon for recently bereaved people to hear voices, and this may sometimes be the voice of their loved one. Practical advice If you're hearing voices, discuss any concerns you have with your GP. If necessary, they'll refer you to a psychiatrist. This is important in determining whether you have a serious mental illness. There's no shame in seeing a psychiatrist, and it's important to be thoroughly assessed and treated early. If your voices are due to schizophrenia, the earlier your treatment is started, the better the outcome. You may also find the following advice helpful: talk to other voice hearers \u2013 the Hearing Voices Network is a UK-based charity that can give you help and support, and put you in touch with other people in a similar situation to you be open to discussing your voices try to understand where the voices come from, why and what triggers them The Mental Health Foundation has more information and practical advice about how to deal with hearing voices. Drug-induced hallucinations  Illegal drugs and alcohol People can experience hallucinations when they're high on illegal drugs such as amphetamines, cocaine, LSD or ecstasy. They can also occur during withdrawal from alcohol or drugs if you suddenly stop taking them. Drug-induced hallucinations are usually visual, but they may affect other senses. They can include flashes of light or abstract shapes, or they may take the form of an animal or person. More often, visual distortions occur that alter the person's perception of the world around them.  The hallucinations can occur on their own or as a part of drug-induced psychosis. After long-term drug use, they may cause schizophrenia. Some people take cannabis to \"calm themselves\" and relieve their psychotic symptoms, without realising that in the longer term, the cannabis makes the psychosis worse. Heavy alcohol use can also lead to psychotic states, hallucinations and dementia. Find out how to get help for a drug problem. Medication Various prescription medicines can occasionally cause hallucinations. Elderly people may be at particular risk. Hallucinations caused by medication can be dose-related and they usually stop when you stop taking the medicine. However, never stop taking a medication without speaking to your doctor first and, if necessary, after being assessed by a psychiatrist. Speak to your GP about how the medication is affecting you, so you can discuss the possibility of switching to another medicine.  Hallucinations and sleep It's relatively common for people to experience hallucinations just as they're falling asleep (hypnagogic), or as they start to wake up (hypnopompic).  The hallucination may take the form of sounds, or the person may see things that don't exist, such as moving objects, or a formed image, such as a person (the person may think they've seen a ghost). Hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations are particularly common in people with narcolepsy. However, they can also occur in people without narcolepsy or any disorder. They're essentially like dreams, and in themselves are nothing to worry about. Hallucinations in children with a fever  Hallucinations can sometimes occur in children who are ill with a fever. Call your GP if your child is unwell with a body temperature of over 37.5C (99.5F) and you think they're hallucinating. In the meantime, stay calm, keep your child cool and reassure them. Encourage them to drink plenty of fluids and give them paracetamol or ibuprofen (always read the patient information leaflet to find out the correct dose and frequency for your child\u2019s age, and check they're not allergic to medicines you give). The hallucinations should pass after a few minutes. Read more about fever in children. Charles Bonnet syndrome It's estimated that around 60% of people with visual impairment may experience temporary visual hallucinations. This is known as Charles Bonnet syndrome and it tends to affect older people who have started to lose their sight, although it can affect people of any age.  The hallucinations usually last for about 12 to 18 months and can take the form of simple, repeated patterns or complex images of people, objects or landscapes. Some of the most common causes of visual impairment include: age-related macular degeneration (AMD) \u2013 where the central part of the back of the eye (the macula, which plays an important role in central vision) stops working properly cataracts \u2013 when changes in the lens of the eye cause it to become less transparent (clear)  glaucoma \u2013 where fluid builds up inside the eye, damaging the optic nerve (which relays information from the eye to the brain) diabetic retinopathy \u2013 where blood vessels that supply the eye become damaged from a build-up of glucose In the UK, around 100,000 people are thought to be affected by Charles Bonnet syndrome. Hallucinations in older people with delirium Hallucinations can sometimes occur in frail older people who are ill. The hallucinations may start before other signs that the person is unwell. They may be caused by a chest infection or urine infection, for example. Call the GP if your elderly relative suddenly develops hallucinations, particularly if they appear unwell in any other way.

The main sign of a bunion is the big toe pointing towards the other toes on the same foot, which may force the foot bone attached to it (the first metatarsal) to stick outwards. Other symptoms may include: a swollen, bony bump on the outside edge of your foot pain and swelling over your big toe joint that's made worse by pressure from wearing shoes hard, callused and red skin caused by your big toe and second toe overlapping sore skin over the top of the bunion changes to the shape of your foot, making it difficult to find shoes that fit These symptoms can sometimes get worse if the bunion is left untreated, so it's best to see a GP. They'll ask you about your symptoms and examine your foot. In some cases, an X-ray may be recommended to assess the severity of your bunion. Anyone can develop a bunion, but they're more common in women than men. This may be because of the style of footwear that women wear. What causes bunions? The exact cause of bunions is unknown, but they tend to run in families. Wearing badly fitting shoes is thought to make bunions worse. It's also thought that bunions are more likely to occur in people with unusually flexible joints, which is why bunions sometimes occur in children. In some cases, certain health conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout, may also be responsible. Read more about the causes of bunions. Treating bunions There are a number of treatment options for bunions. Non-surgical treatments are usually tried first, including painkillers, orthotics (insoles) and bunion pads. However, these can only help to reduce the symptoms of bunions, such as pain. They don't improve the appearance of your foot. Surgery may be considered if your symptoms are severe and don't respond to non-surgical treatments. The type of surgery will depend on the level of deformity, the severity of your symptoms, your age, and any other associated medical conditions. Read more about treating bunions.  Complications If bunions aren't treated, they can lead to further problems. For example, they can cause arthritis in your big toe and push your second toe out of place. Problems can also develop after bunion surgery. While surgery is usually effective (symptoms are improved in 85% of cases), bunions can sometimes return. In less than 10% of cases, complications occur after bunion surgery. These will depend on the type of surgery you have and can include: stiffness in your toe joints a delay or failure of the bone to heal, or the bone healing in the wrong position pain under the ball of your foot damage to the nerves in your foot prolonged swelling and continued pain the need for further surgery Read more about the complications of bunions. Preventing bunions The best way to reduce your chances of developing bunions is to wear shoes that fit properly. Shoes that are too tight or have high heels can force your toes together. Bunions are rare in populations that don\u2019t wear shoes. Make sure your shoes are the correct size and that there's enough room to move your toes freely. It's best to avoid wearing shoes with high heels or pointy toes.

You won't be able to straighten the end of the finger because the tendon connecting the muscle to the finger bone is stretched or torn. The finger will also be painful and swollen. Sometimes a small fragment of bone breaks off with the tendon. Mallet finger is most often caused by a minor injury, such as catching the finger on clothing or bedding. It's also a common sports injury, particularly in sports where a ball or another object can strike the end of a finger. In some cases, mallet finger can be caused by a cut to the end of the finger on the side of the nail. What should I do? If you think you have mallet finger, go to your nearest minor injuries unit or accident and emergency (A&E) department to have it splinted. You should do this as soon as possible \u2013 the earlier it's treated, the better the outcome. Try to keep your hand raised until the doctor sees you. This helps to reduce any swelling and pain. Take off any rings on the affected finger, as swelling may make it difficult to remove them later or may cut off the blood supply to the finger. You can take an over-the-counter painkiller, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to relieve the pain. Once your finger is splinted, applying an ice pack a few times a day for 10 to 20 minutes may also help reduce pain and swelling. How is it treated? Your finger will be placed in a plastic splint, which keeps it straight, with the end joint slightly bent backwards. You'll still be able to bend the finger at the middle joint. Sometimes a custom splint is made by an occupational therapy team if a standard one doesn't fit well. The splint is taped on, and must be worn day and night for 6 to 12 weeks to allow the two ends of the torn tendon to stay together and heal. It should only be removed for cleaning. It's really important that the end of your finger doesn't bend during the time it's splinted, as this may slow down healing and reduce the effectiveness of the treatment. The middle joint of the finger is left free so you can continue to move it to prevent any stiffness developing. You should only need surgery if the finger bone has broken \u2013 known as a mallet fracture or bony mallet injury \u2013 or in the uncommon situation where the mallet finger fails to heal. How do I keep my finger and splint clean? The splinted finger must be kept clean and dry at all times. If the skin becomes wet inside the splint, it will become very sore. It's important to wash both your finger and the splint at least once a day, following these instructions: Keep your finger flat on the table, cut the strapping, and slide the splint off your finger. Wash and dry your finger and the splint using soap and water. Keep the end joint straight at all times by keeping your finger flat on the table. You may find it easier if someone helps you do this each day, as any movement of the end of the finger will delay the healing of the tendon, and may even cause permanent damage. Slide the splint back over the fingertip, still keeping the finger straight. Replace the strapping \u2013 this should cover the middle of the splint, but should not cover the middle joint of the finger. How long will it take to heal? Your mallet finger should heal within 6 to 12 weeks, after which time you'll be able to use the finger again. You may be advised to continue to only wear the splint at night for up to four more weeks. Sometimes you only need to see a specialist once, as a hand physiotherapist can take over your care. They'll provide you with exercises to perform at home to help prevent stiffness in the finger. Depending on your job, you may require time off work. It's important to avoid any sports involving the hands while your injury is healing. It may take several months to regain full function. Redness, swelling, and tenderness of the skin around the end of the finger are common for three or four months after injury, but usually settle eventually. Fractures involving the joint of the finger also increase the risk of arthritis in the future. You may be left with a small bump on the top of the joint and a slight loss of ability to straighten the joint \u2013 it never really goes completely back to normal. However, the finger should generally function well. Page last reviewed: 18\/03\/2015 Next review due: 18\/03\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's a common injury in athletes and can occur in different severities. The three grades of hamstring injury are: grade 1 \u2013 a mild muscle pull or strain grade 2 \u2013 a partial muscle tear grade 3 \u2013 a complete muscle tear The length of time it takes to recover from a hamstring strain or tear will depend on how severe the injury is. A minor muscle pull or strain (grade 1) may take a few days to heal, whereas it could take weeks or months to recover from a muscle tear (grade 2 or 3). The hamstrings The hamstrings are tendons (strong bands of tissue) at the back of the thighs that attach the large thigh muscle to the bone. The term 'hamstring' also refers to the group of three muscles that run along the back of your thigh, from your hip to just below your knee. The hamstring muscles aren't used much while standing or walking, but they're very active during activities that involve bending the knee, such as running, jumping and climbing. What causes hamstring injuries? A hamstring injury can occur if any of the tendons or muscles are stretched beyond their limit. They often occur during sudden, explosive movements, such as sprinting, lunging or jumping. But they can also occur more gradually, or during slower movements that overstretch your hamstring. Recurring injury is common in athletes and sportsmen, as you're more likely to injure your hamstring if you've injured it before. Regularly doing stretching and strengthening exercises, and warming up before exercise, may help reduce the risk of injuring your hamstring. How do I know if I've injured my hamstring? Mild hamstring strains (grade 1) will usually cause sudden pain and tenderness the back of your thigh. It may be painful to move your leg, but the strength of the muscle shouldn't be affected. Partial hamstring tears (grade 2) are usually more painful and tender. There may also be some swelling and bruising at the back of your thigh and you may have lost some strength in your leg. Severe hamstring tears (grade 3) will usually be very painful, tender, swollen and bruised. There may have been a \"popping\" sensation at the time of the injury and you'll be unable to use the affected leg. When to see your GP Most hamstring injuries can be cared for at home using the techniques outlined below. Consider seeing your GP if you have any concerns about your injury, particularly if you think it's a severe injury, it's not healing, or your symptoms are getting worse. Your GP can also advise you about when you can return to your normal activities and what exercises you should do to aid your recovery in the meantime. They may be able to refer you to a physiotherapist for specialist treatment in some cases. Rest and recovery Recovering from a hamstring injury may take days, weeks or months, depending on how severe the strain or tear is. A completely torn hamstring (grade 3) may take several months to heal and you'll be unable to resume training or play sport during this time. Initial treatment During the first two or three days, you should care for your injury by following the steps below. Rest \u2013 keep your leg as still as you possibly can and avoid physical activity. Your GP may recommend using crutches in more severe cases. Ice \u2013 apply cold packs (a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel will also work) to your hamstring for 15 to 20 minutes every two to three hours during the day. Don't apply ice directly to your skin. Compression \u2013 compress or bandage the thigh to limit any swelling and movement that could cause further damage. You can use a simple elastic bandage or elasticated tubular bandage available from a pharmacy. Elevation \u2013 keep your leg raised and supported on a pillow as much as possible, to help reduce any swelling. Regular painkillers, such as paracetamol or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) cream or gel, may also help relieve the pain. Short-term use of oral NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen tablets, can also help reduce swelling and inflammation. However, these aren't suitable for everyone. Check the leaflet that comes with your medication to see if you can take it. Gentle exercises and stretches Returning to strenuous exercise too quickly could make your injury worse, but avoiding exercise for too long can cause your hamstring muscles to shrink and scar tissue to form around the tear. To avoid this, you should start doing gentle hamstring stretches after a few days, when the pain has started to subside. This should be followed by a programme of gentle exercise, such as walking and cycling, and hamstring strengthening exercises. Your GP can give you further advice and, if necessary, refer you to a physiotherapist for a suitable exercise programme. To avoid injuring yourself again, you should only return to a full level of activity when your hamstring muscles are strong enough. Your physiotherapist or GP will be able to advise you about this. Many people need to avoid sports for at least a few weeks, but the length of time you need off will depend on the severity of your injury.

If the pain persists even after resting your hand and taking painkillers, or if you have other symptoms and are uncertain of the cause, see your GP. In the meantime, you can read this page to learn about the common causes of hand pain. It may give you a better idea of the problem, but you shouldn't use this guide to diagnose yourself \u2013 always leave that to your GP. Common causes of hand pain are: carpal tunnel syndrome arthritis a ganglion  de Quervain's disease trigger finger or thumb tenosynovitis (inflammation of a tendon sheath) a fracture Carpal tunnel syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome is a relatively common condition that causes pain, numbness and a tingling sensation in the hand and fingers. These sensations usually develop gradually and start off being worse during the night. They tend to affect the thumb, index finger, middle finger and half of the ring finger. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the nerve that controls sensation and movement in the hands. It will sometimes get better on its own. Otherwise, wrist splints and corticosteroid injections are often recommended. There is a lack of evidence to support the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. Surgery (carpal tunnel release surgery) is usually only recommended for severe cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, when symptoms last for more than six months or other treatments have not been effective. Read more about carpal tunnel syndrome. Arthritis Arthritis is a common condition that causes pain and inflammation in a joint. Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK. It often affects three main areas of the hand: base of the thumb joints closest to the fingertips middle joints of the fingers The fingers may become stiff, painful and swollen, and bumps may develop on the finger joints. Over time, the pain may decrease and eventually disappear altogether, although the bumps and swelling can still remain. The fingers may bend sideways slightly at the affected joints. Painful cysts may develop on the backs of the fingers. In some cases, a bump may also develop at the base of the thumb, where it joins the wrist. This can be painful, making it difficult to perform manual tasks such as writing, opening jars or turning keys. Osteoarthritis also commonly affects the knees and hips, so is probably the cause if you have pain in other joints as well. Read more about osteoarthritis, including how it is treated. Rheumatoid arthritis The hands and wrists can also be affected by rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system (which usually fights infection) attacks the cells that line your joints by mistake, making them swollen, stiff and painful. The hand pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis is usually a throbbing and aching pain. It is often worse in the mornings and after a period of inactivity. Read more about rheumatoid arthritis, including the symptoms and how it is treated. A ganglion A ganglion is a fluid-filled swelling that develops near a joint or a tendon, ranging in size from a pea to a golf ball. It looks and feels like a smooth, soft lump under the skin. It is made up of a thick, jelly-like fluid, called synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate and cushion them during movement. Ganglions are most common on the wrists (particularly the back of the wrist), hands and fingers. They are generally harmless, but can sometimes be painful, especially if they are next to a nerve. Read more about ganglions. De Quervain's disease De Quervain's disease is a painful condition that affects tendons where they run through a tunnel on the thumb side of the wrist. The sheath surrounding the tendon becomes swollen and thick, and moving your thumb will be very painful. The cause isn't understood. Some sources claim it is a type of tenosynovitis (see below) or tendonitis, but this is not true. De Quervain's disease is not associated with inflammation. Some mild cases get better on their own after a few weeks of rest and avoiding the activity that triggered it. A wrist splint or a corticosteroid injection may help. Severe cases may need to be treated with surgery, which involves widening the tunnel through which the tendon passes. Read more about de Quervain's disease (links to external site). Trigger finger or thumb Trigger finger is a condition that affects the tendons in the hand. When the affected finger or thumb is bent towards the palm, the tendon gets stuck and the finger clicks or locks. The exact cause is not known. The symptoms can include pain, stiffness, clicking and a small lump in the palm at the base of the affected finger or thumb. If you think you may have trigger finger, make an appointment to see your GP, so they can examine your hand and offer advice about treatment.  In some people, trigger finger may get better without treatment. Read more about trigger finger, including how it is treated. Tenosynovitis  Tenosynovitis is pain and inflammation of the sheath that surrounds a tendon. It's a relatively rare cause of hand pain that can affect the wrist or the fingers. The cause is not always known. It may be brought on by a series of small injuries to the tendon, a previous injury or strain, infection, or rheumatoid arthritis. It's important to rest the hand or keep the tendons still, to allow recovery. You might be able to relieve the pain and inflammation by applying heat or cold to the area, and by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen. Injections of corticosteroids (steroid medication) can sometimes help. Tenosynovitis caused by infection will need treating with antibiotics. After the hand has recovered, strengthening exercises using the muscles around the affected tendon will help prevent the injury returning. Your GP or physiotherapist will be able to advise about this. A fracture It is often obvious when you have broken your finger or wrist bone, as your hand will be extremely painful, and there may also be swelling or tenderness around the injured area. If you think you have broken a bone, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Read more about a broken wrist and broken finger.

What are tendons? Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones. When a group of muscles contract (tighten), the attached tendons will pull on certain bones, allowing you to make a wide range of movements. There are two groups of tendons in the hand: extensor tendons \u2013 which run from the forearm, across the back of your hand to your fingers and thumb, allowing you to straighten your fingers and thumb flexor tendons \u2013 which run from your forearm, through your wrist and across the palm of your hand, allowing you to bend your fingers Surgery can often be carried out to repair damage to both these groups of tendons. When hand tendon repair is needed Hand tendon repair is carried out when one or more tendons in your hand rupture or are cut, leading to loss of normal hand movements. If your extensor tendons are damaged, you'll be unable to straighten one or more fingers. If your flexor tendons are damaged, you'll be unable to bend one or more fingers. Tendon damage can also cause pain and inflammation (swelling) in your hand. In some cases, damage to the extensor tendons can be treated without the need for surgery, using a rigid support called a splint that\u2019s worn around the hand. Common causes of tendon injuries include: cuts \u2013 cuts across the back or palm of your hand can result in injury to your tendons  sports injuries \u2013 extensor tendons can rupture when stubbing a finger, such as trying to catch a ball; flexor tendons can occasionally be pulled off the bone when grabbing an opponent's jersey, such as in rugby; and the pulleys holding flexor tendons can rupture during activities that involve lots of strenuous gripping, such as rock climbing bites \u2013 animal and human bites can cause tendon damage, and a person may damage their hand tendon after punching another person in the teeth crushing injuries \u2013 jamming a finger in a door or crushing the hand in a car accident can divide or rupture a tendon  rheumatoid arthritis \u2013 rheumatoid arthritis can cause tendons to become inflamed, which in severe cases can lead to tendons rupturing Tendon repair surgery Tendon repair may involve the surgeon making an incision in your wrist, hand or finger so they can locate the ends of the divided tendon and stitch them together. Extensor tendons are easier to reach, so repairing them is relatively straightforward. Depending on the type of injury, it may be possible to repair extensor tendons in an accident and emergency (A&E) department using a local anaesthetic to numb the affected area. Repairing flexor tendons is more challenging because the flexor tendon system is more complex. Flexor tendon repair usually needs to be carried out under either general anaesthetic or regional anaesthetic (where the whole arm is numbed) in an operating theatre by an experienced plastic or orthopaedic surgeon who specialises in hand surgery. Read more about how hand tendon repair is performed. Recovering from surgery Both types of tendon surgery require a lengthy period of recovery (rehabilitation) because the repaired tendons will be weak until the ends heal together. Depending on the location of the injury, it can take up to three months for the repaired tendon to regain its previous strength. Rehabilitation involves protecting your tendons from overuse using a hand splint. You'll usually need to wear a hand splint for several weeks after surgery. You'll also need to perform hand exercises regularly during your recovery to stop the repaired tendons sticking to nearby tissue, which can prevent you from being able to fully move your hand. When you can return to work will depend on your job. Light activities can often be resumed after 6-8 weeks and heavy activities and sport after 10-12 weeks. Read more about recovering from hand tendon repair. Results After an extensor tendon repair you should have a working finger or thumb, but you may not regain full movement. The outcome is often better when the injury is a clean cut to the tendon, rather than one that involves crushing or damage to the bones and joints. A flexor tendon injury is generally more serious because they're often put under more strain than extensor tendons. After a flexor tendon repair, it's quite common for some fingers to not regain full movement. However, the tendon repair will still give a better result than not having surgery. In some cases, complications develop after surgery, such as infection or the repaired tendon snapping or sticking to nearby tissue. In these circumstances, further treatment may be required.

It's most common in young children \u2013 particularly those under 10 \u2013 but can affect older children and adults as well. Hand, foot and mouth disease can be unpleasant, but it will usually clear up by itself within 7 to 10 days. You can normally look after yourself or your child at home. The infection is not related to foot and mouth disease, which affects cattle, sheep and pigs. This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you or your child has it When to get medical advice How it spreads Prevention Symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease The symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease usually develop between three and five days after being exposed to the infection. The first symptoms may include: a high temperature (fever), usually around 38-39C (100.4-102.2F) a general sense of feeling unwell loss of appetite coughing abdominal (tummy) pain a sore throat and mouth  Mouth ulcers After one or two days, red spots appear on the tongue and inside the mouth. These quickly develop into larger yellow-grey mouth ulcers with red edges. The ulcers can be painful and make eating, drinking and swallowing difficult. They should pass within a week. Spotty rash and blisters Soon after the mouth ulcers appear, you'll probably notice a rash made up of small, raised red spots on the skin. These typically develop on the fingers, the backs or palms of the hand, the soles of the feet, and occasionally on the buttocks and groin. The spots may then turn into small blisters with a grey centre. The spots and blisters can sometimes be itchy or uncomfortable and typically last up to 10 days. What to do if you or your child has hand, foot and mouth disease If you have hand, foot and mouth disease, the best thing to do is to stay at home until you're feeling better. There's no cure for it, so you have to let it run its course. To help ease your or your child's symptoms: drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration \u2013 water or milk are ideal; it may help to give a baby smaller but more frequent bottle or breast milk feeds eat soft foods such as mashed potatoes, yoghurt and soups if eating and swallowing is uncomfortable \u2013 avoid hot, acidic or spicy foods and drinks take over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to ease a sore throat and fever \u2013 aspirin shouldn't be given to children under the age of 16; paracetamol is best if you're pregnant try gargling with warm, salty water to relieve discomfort from mouth ulcers \u2013 it's important not to swallow the mixture, so this isn't recommended for young children alternatively, use mouth gels, rinses or sprays for mouth ulcers \u2013 these are available from pharmacies, but aren't routinely recommended, and some aren't suitable for young children; ask your pharmacist for advice and make sure you read the instructions first You should keep your child away from nursery or school until they're feeling better. Adults with the condition should stay away from work until they're feeling better. See preventing hand, foot and mouth disease below for more information about stopping the infection spreading. When to get medical advice You don't usually need medical attention if you think you or your child has hand, foot and mouth disease. The infection will usually pass in 7 to 10 days, and there isn't much your doctor can do. Antibiotics won't help as hand, foot and mouth disease is caused by a virus. If you're unsure whether you or your child has hand, foot and mouth disease, you can call NHS 111 or your GP for advice. You should also get medical advice if: your child is unable or unwilling to drink any fluids your child has signs of dehydration, such as unresponsiveness, passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or cold hands and feet your child develops fits (seizures), confusion, weakness or a loss of consciousness your child is under three months old and has a temperature of 38C (101F) or above, or is between three and six months old and has a temperature of 39C (102F) or above the skin becomes very painful, red, swollen and hot, or there's a discharge of pus the symptoms are getting worse or haven't improved after 7 to 10 days Get advice from your GP if you're pregnant and you become infected within a few weeks of your due date. Infection in pregnancy is usually nothing to worry about, but there's a small chance it could make your baby ill if you're infected shortly before you give birth. Read more about the risks of hand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy. How hand, foot and mouth disease spreads Someone with hand, foot and mouth disease is most infectious from just before their symptoms start until they're feeling better. The infection can be spread by close person to person contact and contact with contaminated surfaces. The virus is found in: the droplets in the coughs and sneezes of an infected person \u2013 you can become infected if you get these on your hands and then touch your mouth, or if you breathe in the droplets an infected person's poo \u2013 if an infected person doesn't wash their hands properly after going to the toilet, they can contaminate food or surfaces an infected person's saliva or fluid from their blisters \u2013 you can become infected if this gets in your mouth The infection is caused by a number of different viruses, so it's possible to get it more than once. Most people develop immunity to these viruses as they get older. Preventing hand, foot and mouth disease It's not always possible to avoid getting hand, foot and mouth disease, but following the advice below can help stop the infection spreading. Stay off work, school or nursery until you or your child are feeling better \u2013 there's usually no need to wait until the last blister has healed, provided you're otherwise well. Use tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and put used tissues in a bin as soon as possible. Wash your hands with soap and water often \u2013 particularly after going to the toilet, coughing, sneezing or handling nappies, and before preparing food. Avoid sharing cups, utensils, towels and clothes with people who are infected. Disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated \u2013 it's best to use a bleach-based household cleaner. Wash any bedding or clothing that could have become contaminated separately on a hot wash. Read more about how to prevent germs spreading.

Alcohol is a diuretic (meaning it removes fluids from the body), so drinking too much can lead to dehydration. Dehydration is what causes many of the symptoms of a hangover. Alcohol can upset your stomach and give you a bad night's sleep. You may still have some alcohol in your system the next morning.  Cure myth Hangover cures are generally a myth. There are no cures for a hangover. There are tips for avoiding hangovers and for easing the symptoms if you have one. The best way to avoid a hangover is not to drink. If you decide to drink: limit how much you drink in single session drink more slowly drink with food alternate with water or non-alcoholic drinks To avoid a hangover, don't drink more than you know your body can cope with. If you're not sure how much that is, be careful.  To reduce the risk of harming your health if you drink most weeks: men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over three days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week Know your units You can keep track of how many units you're consuming using the One You Drinks Tracker app available from iTunes and Google Play.  A large glass of wine, for instance, contains around three units. In one evening, that can quickly add up to a lot more than you intended to drink. Here are some examples: a can of standard lager, beer or bitter \u2013 1.8 units  a pint of standard lager, beer or bitter \u2013 2.3 units a small glass of wine (125ml) \u2013 1.5 units a large glass of wine (250ml) \u2013 3 units  a measure of spirits (25ml) \u2013 1 unit   Follow these tips to keep hangovers away: Don't drink on an empty stomach. Before you go out, have a meal that includes carbohydrates (such as pasta or rice) or fats. The food will help slow down the body's absorption of alcohol. Don't drink dark-coloured drinks if you've found that you're sensitive to them. They contain natural chemicals called congeners (impurities), which irritate blood vessels and tissue in the brain and can make a hangover worse. Drink water or non-fizzy soft drinks in between each alcoholic drink. Carbonated (fizzy) drinks speed up the absorption of alcohol into your system. Drink a pint or so of water before you go to sleep. Keep a glass of water by the bed to sip if you wake up during the night.  The morning after If you wake up the next morning feeling terrible, you probably didn't follow this advice. Although there are no real cures for hangovers, there are ways to ease the symptoms. Treatment involves rehydrating the body so it can deal with the painful symptoms (though the best time to rehydrate is before going to sleep). Over-the-counter painkillers can help with headaches and muscle cramps. Paracetamol-based remedies are usually preferable, as aspirin may further irritate the stomach and increase nausea and sickness. Sugary foods may help you feel less trembly. In some cases, an antacid may be needed to settle your stomach first. Bouillon soup, a thin vegetable-based broth, is a good source of vitamins and minerals, which can top-up depleted resources. Its main advantage is that it's easy for a fragile stomach to digest. You can replace lost fluids by drinking bland liquids that are easy on the digestive system, such as water, soda water and isotonic drinks (available in most shops). \"Hair of the dog\" (drinking more alcohol) does not help. Drinking in the morning is a risky habit, and you may simply be delaying the appearance of symptoms until the alcohol wears off again. If you've had a heavy drinking session, hangover or not, doctors advise that you wait at least 48 hours before drinking any more alcohol, to give your body tissues time to recover. Sometimes, of course, a hangover makes that advice easier to follow.

Alcohol is a diuretic (meaning it removes fluids from the body), so drinking too much can lead to dehydration. Dehydration is what causes many of the symptoms of a hangover. Alcohol can upset your stomach and give you a bad night's sleep. You may still have some alcohol in your system the next morning.  Cure myth Hangover cures are generally a myth. There are no cures for a hangover. There are tips for avoiding hangovers and for easing the symptoms if you have one. The best way to avoid a hangover is not to drink. If you decide to drink: limit how much you drink in single session drink more slowly drink with food alternate with water or non-alcoholic drinks To avoid a hangover, don't drink more than you know your body can cope with. If you're not sure how much that is, be careful.  To reduce the risk of harming your health if you drink most weeks: men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over three days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week Know your units You can keep track of how many units you're consuming using the One You Drinks Tracker app available from iTunes and Google Play.  A large glass of wine, for instance, contains around three units. In one evening, that can quickly add up to a lot more than you intended to drink. Here are some examples: a can of standard lager, beer or bitter \u2013 1.8 units  a pint of standard lager, beer or bitter \u2013 2.3 units a small glass of wine (125ml) \u2013 1.5 units a large glass of wine (250ml) \u2013 3 units  a measure of spirits (25ml) \u2013 1 unit   Follow these tips to keep hangovers away: Don't drink on an empty stomach. Before you go out, have a meal that includes carbohydrates (such as pasta or rice) or fats. The food will help slow down the body's absorption of alcohol. Don't drink dark-coloured drinks if you've found that you're sensitive to them. They contain natural chemicals called congeners (impurities), which irritate blood vessels and tissue in the brain and can make a hangover worse. Drink water or non-fizzy soft drinks in between each alcoholic drink. Carbonated (fizzy) drinks speed up the absorption of alcohol into your system. Drink a pint or so of water before you go to sleep. Keep a glass of water by the bed to sip if you wake up during the night.  The morning after If you wake up the next morning feeling terrible, you probably didn't follow this advice. Although there are no real cures for hangovers, there are ways to ease the symptoms. Treatment involves rehydrating the body so it can deal with the painful symptoms (though the best time to rehydrate is before going to sleep). Over-the-counter painkillers can help with headaches and muscle cramps. Paracetamol-based remedies are usually preferable, as aspirin may further irritate the stomach and increase nausea and sickness. Sugary foods may help you feel less trembly. In some cases, an antacid may be needed to settle your stomach first. Bouillon soup, a thin vegetable-based broth, is a good source of vitamins and minerals, which can top-up depleted resources. Its main advantage is that it's easy for a fragile stomach to digest. You can replace lost fluids by drinking bland liquids that are easy on the digestive system, such as water, soda water and isotonic drinks (available in most shops). \"Hair of the dog\" (drinking more alcohol) does not help. Drinking in the morning is a risky habit, and you may simply be delaying the appearance of symptoms until the alcohol wears off again. If you've had a heavy drinking session, hangover or not, doctors advise that you wait at least 48 hours before drinking any more alcohol, to give your body tissues time to recover. Sometimes, of course, a hangover makes that advice easier to follow.

The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland found in the neck. It produces hormones that are released into the bloodstream to control the body's growth and metabolism. They affect processes such as heart rate and body temperature, and help convert food into energy to keep the body going. There are several different types of thyroiditis. The common types are: Hashimoto's thyroiditis (the most common) de Quervain's or subacute thyroiditis  post-partum thyroiditis (triggered after giving birth) silent or painless thyroiditis  drug-induced thyroiditis  radiation-induced thyroiditis  acute or infectious thyroiditis  The symptoms and treatment of these conditions are briefly described below.  Hashimoto's thyroiditis  Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition. This means your immune system mistakenly attacks your thyroid gland, causing it to gradually swell and become damaged. As the thyroid gland is slowly destroyed over time, it is unable to produce sufficient amounts of thyroid hormone. The medical term for low levels of thyroid hormone in the blood is hypothyroidism. This leads to symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland, which are very general and can include: fatigue weight gain constipation dry skin depression The swollen thyroid gland may also cause a lump to form in your throat, known as a goitre. It may take months or even years for the condition to be detected, because the disease progresses very slowly. The cause of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is not understood, but it sometimes appears to run in families, suggesting your genes may make you more likely to develop the condition. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is also associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as Addison's disease and type 1 diabetes. It is usually seen in women aged 30 to 50.  Hashimoto's thyroiditis cannot be cured, so the low levels of thyroid hormone are usually permanent. However, the symptoms are often easily treated with the thyroid hormone replacement medication levothyroxine, which is usually taken for life. Surgery is only rarely needed, for instance if your goitre is particularly uncomfortable  or there are suspicions of cancer. Read about treating an underactive thyroid gland and treating goitre. De Quervain's (subacute) thyroiditis  De Quervain's thyroiditis (sometimes called subacute thyroiditis) is a painful swelling of the thyroid gland that is thought to be triggered by a viral infection, such as mumps or the flu.  It's most commonly seen in females aged 20 to 50. De Quervain's thyroiditis usually causes a fever and pain in the neck, jaw or ear. It can also cause your thyroid gland to release too much thyroid hormone into the blood (thyrotoxicosis), leading to symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), including: anxiety insomnia heart palpitations weight loss irritability The palpitations and shakes associated with thyrotoxicosis can be treated with a beta-blocker. The pain caused by de Quervain\u2019s thyroiditis can often be relieved with painkillers such as aspirin, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen. In the cases where these medications are ineffective, corticosteroid medication may be prescribed. De Quervain\u2019s thyroiditis settles down after a few days and is often followed by a spell of hypothyroidism lasting a few weeks or months, before the thyroid gland recovers completely. Very occasionally, the condition may recur or the low levels of thyroid hormones caused by it can be permanent and may require long-term treatment with thyroid hormone replacement medication. Post-partum thyroiditis  Like Hashimoto's thyroiditis, post-partum thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition, but it only happens in women who have recently given birth. In post-partum thyroiditis, your immune system attacks your thyroid gland within around six months of giving birth, causing a temporary rise in thyroid hormone levels (thyrotoxicosis) and symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland. Then, after a few weeks, your thyroid gland becomes depleted of thyroid hormone, leading to low levels of thyroid hormone and symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland. However, not every woman with post-partum thyroiditis will go through both these phases.  If low thyroid hormone levels are causing severe symptoms, you may need to take thyroid hormone replacement until the condition gets better. In most women with the condition, thyroid function returns to normal within 12 months after the baby is born, although the low thyroid hormone levels can sometimes be permanent. Silent (painless) thyroiditis  Silent thyroiditis is very similar to post-partum thyroiditis. It is also an autoimmune condition, but is not related to giving birth and can occur in both men and women. Like postpartum thyroiditis, there may be a phase of high thyroid hormone levels (thyrotoxicosis), causing symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland. This may then be followed by a phase of symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland, before the symptoms eventually go away within around 12 to 18 months. If low thyroid hormone levels are causing severe symptoms, you may need to take thyroid hormone replacement until the condition gets better. In a few cases, the low thyroid levels can be permanent. Drug-induced thyroiditis  Thyroiditis can also be triggered by medications including interferon, amiodarone, lithium and a class of drugs to treat certain cancers (which include sunitinib), if these medicines damage the thyroid gland. There may be symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland or symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland, but these are usually short-lived and may get better after you stop taking the medication causing the condition. However, you should not stop taking any medication that has been prescribed for you without first discussing it with your doctor. Drug-induced thyroiditis can sometimes cause pain in the area around the thyroid gland. This can often be relieved with NSAIDs, although corticosteroid medication may occasionally be needed. Radiation-induced thyroiditis  Radioactive iodine treatment for an overactive thyroid gland or radiotherapy for certain cancers can also damage the thyroid gland, leading to symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland or symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland. The low levels of thyroid hormone after radioactive iodine is usually permanent, and may cause symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland that will need to be managed with lifelong thyroid hormone replacement treatment.  Acute or infectious thyroiditis  Acute or infectious thyroiditis is usually triggered by a bacterial infection. It is rare and is associated with either a weakened immune system or, in children, with a problem in the development of the thyroid. Symptoms may include pain in the throat, feeling generally unwell, swelling of the thyroid gland and sometimes symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland or symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland. These symptoms will usually get better when the infection is treated with antibiotics. In the meantime, thyroid pain can often be managed with NSAIDs. Children will usually require an operation to remove the abnormal part of the thyroid.

Symptoms of hay fever include: sneezing a runny nose itchy eyes You'll experience hay fever symptoms if you have an allergic reaction to pollen. Pollen is a fine powder released by plants as part of their reproductive cycle. It contains proteins that can cause the nose, eyes, throat and sinuses (small air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead) to become swollen, irritated and inflamed. You can have an allergy to: tree pollen, released during spring grass pollen, released during the end of spring and beginning of summer weed pollen, released late autumn Read more about the causes of hay fever. Many people find their symptoms improve as they get older. Around half of people report some improvement in symptoms after several years. Symptoms disappear completely in around 10-20% of people. Hay fever treatment There's currently no cure for hay fever, but most people are able to relieve symptoms with treatment, at least to a certain extent. The most effective way to control hay fever would be to avoid exposure to pollen. However, it's very difficult to avoid pollen, particularly during the summer months when you want to spend more time outdoors. Treatment options for hay fever include antihistamines, which can help to prevent an allergic reaction from occurring and corticosteroids (steroids), which help to reduce inflammation and swelling. Hay fever can often be controlled using over-the-counter medication from your pharmacist. However, if your symptoms are more troublesome it\u2019s worth speaking to your GP, as you may require prescription medication. For severe and persistent hay fever, there's also a type of treatment called immunotherapy. It involves being exposed to small amounts of pollen over time, to build resistance to its allergic effects. However, this can take many months or even years to work. Read more about treating hay fever. Who's affected Hay fever is one of the most common allergic conditions. It's estimated that there are more than 10 million people with hay fever in England. You can get hay fever at any age, although it usually begins in childhood or during the teenage years. It's more common in boys than girls. In adults, men and women are equally affected. You're more likely to develop hay fever if you have a family history of allergies, particularly asthma or eczema. Self-help tips It's sometimes possible to prevent the symptoms of hay fever by taking some basic precautions, such as: wearing wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting in your eyes when you're outdoors taking a shower and changing your clothes after being outdoors to remove the pollen on your body staying indoors when the pollen count is high (over 50 grains per cubic metre of air) applying a small amount of Vaseline (petroleum gel) to the nasal openings to trap pollen grains Read more about preventing hay fever. Complications Even though hay fever doesn't pose a serious threat to health, it can have a negative impact on a person's quality of life. People with very severe hay fever often find that it can disrupt their productivity at school or work. Inflammation of the sinuses (sinusitis) is another common complication of hay fever. Children may also develop a middle ear infection (otitis media) as a result of hay fever. Read more about the complications of hay fever.   Allergic rhinitis Seasonal allergic rhinitis is the medical term for hay fever. Rhinitis means inflammation of the inside of the nose. Some people also experience hay fever-like symptoms when exposed to other allergy-triggering substances, such as dust mites and animal fur. Read more about other types of allergic rhinitis. Pollen count The pollen count is a measurement of the amount of pollen in the air. The higher the count, the more severe symptoms of hay fever can become (depending on the specific type of pollen you're allergic to). The Met Office provides a pollen forecast. If the pollen count is high, you can take preventative measures, such as taking antihistamine medication, before leaving the house.

Hay fever is also known as seasonal allergic rhinitis Hay fever symptoms, including itchy eyes and a running nose, can be particularly distressing for children, who may find the symptoms harder to manage and won't always realise that they can ask for help. According to Pierre Dugué, consultant allergist at Guy's Hospital in London, you should make an appointment with your GP to get a diagnosis if you think your child may have hay fever. \"It's important to know if it's hay fever, as it could be a non-pollen allergy such as dust mite or pet fur,\" says Dugué. Dugué says hay fever has clear seasonal symptoms, which occur at the same time every year. \"The strict diagnosis of hay fever is allergy to grass pollen. But your child could also be allergic to tree pollen, which usually comes at the end of spring, before grass pollen is produced. \"Allergy to tree pollen usually means allergy to birch, hazel or elder trees, which are in the same family.\" Signs of hay fever in children Hay fever often affects children at school, and while it is typically thought of as occurring in summer, the hay fever season in the UK starts much earlier in the year, during the spring. Look out for symptoms from March to October. Sometimes hay fever can be confused with a virus. The way to tell the difference is by how long the symptoms last. If it's a virus, they should only last for a week or two. Viruses rarely last for weeks and weeks. If your child has a constant runny nose and is sneezing every day for part of the year but not in the winter, it's a sign that they may be allergic to something.  Diagnosing your child's hay fever It's important that hay fever is diagnosed so it can be treated and your child can take steps to avoid it. If your child only has symptoms in July and August on a very sunny day, it's almost certainly hay fever. In this case, you don't really need a formal diagnosis. But if your child has symptoms all year round and you're not sure if it's hay fever, go to your GP for a diagnosis. Your child may have perennial allergic rhinitis. Treating your child's hay fever symptoms If your child doesn't like taking tablets, antihistamines are also available as a liquid. Other treatments include steroid nasal sprays. Eye drops can be particularly useful if eye symptoms are one of the main symptoms of allergic rhinitis.  How to give your child eye drops Below is some advice from the charity Allergy UK on how to give your child eye drops. Before you begin, follow directions such as washing hands in advance to avoid adding more irritants and infections. It can be easiest to administer eye drops by lying your child down and gently pulling down their lower lid \u2013 for example, have their head in front of you as they lie on the end of a bed. Older children sometimes like to sit in a chair while the drops are administered as they lean back and look up. When you add one drop gently into the eye, your child will naturally blink as a reflex and may then find the drops initially uncomfortable. When giving eye drops to young children, it can be helpful to have something you can use to distract them once the eye drops have been given, such as letting your child put a star on their chart. It can be helpful to role play with your child using a doll or teddy bear, telling them what is going to happen and letting them do it to their toy themselves after having their own eye drops administered. Remember to praise older children after medication, as it can also be uncomfortable for them. Mentioning to others how well your child is coping while they are present can boost their self-esteem and make them more compliant. Preventing hay fever symptoms in children Pollen is released in the early morning. As the air warms up, the pollen is carried up above our heads. As evening comes and the air cools, pollen comes back down. This means that symptoms are usually worse first thing in the morning and early evening, particularly on days that have been warm and sunny. To reduce your child's exposure to pollens:  Keep windows closed at night so pollen doesn't enter the house. Buy your child a pair of wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen entering their eyes. Smear petroleum jelly (Vaseline) or another pollen blocker around the inside of your child's nose to trap pollen and stop it being inhaled. Wash your child's hair, face and hands when they come back indoors, and change their clothes. Don't let them play in fields or large areas of grassland.  Use air filters to try to reduce pollen that's floating around the house. Keep the car windows shut when driving.

Make an appointment to see your GP if your symptoms don't improve after using antihistamines. You may need treatment with prescription medications, such as nasal steroid medication (corticosteroids). The various treatments for hay fever are outlined below. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons of hay fever treatments, allowing you to compare your treatment options. Antihistamines Antihistamines treat hay fever by blocking the action of the chemical histamine, which the body releases when it thinks it's under attack from an allergen. This stops the symptoms of the allergic reaction. Antihistamines are usually effective at treating itching, sneezing and watery eyes, but they may not help with clearing a blocked nose. They're available in tablet form and also as nasal sprays and eye drops. You can use antihistamines as: an \"as-required\" treatment \u2013 you take them when you first notice you're developing the symptoms of hay fever a preventative treatment \u2013 for example, if you know there's going to be a high pollen count, you can take them before leaving the house in the morning Different antihistamine tablets for hay fever include cetirizine, fexofenadine and loratadine. Azelastine is an effective antihistamine nasal spray and olopatadine is an antihistamine eye drop. Unlike older antihistamines, these newer types shouldn't cause drowsiness, although this can occasionally happen to some people. If you do become drowsy after using antihistamines, you should avoid driving or using heavy tools or machinery. You should also contact your GP or pharmacist, as there may be an alternative antihistamine you can take. Read more about antihistamines. Corticosteroid nasal sprays and drops Corticosteroids (steroids) are used to treat hay fever because they have an anti-inflammatory effect. When pollen triggers your allergic reaction, the inside of your nose becomes inflamed. Corticosteroids can reduce the inflammation and prevent the symptoms of hay fever. Your GP may prescribe corticosteroid nasal sprays or drops instead of antihistamines if: you have persistent hay fever that doesn't respond to antihistamines your main symptom is a blocked nose you're pregnant or breastfeeding Corticosteroid nose drops (containing betamethasone and fluticasone) are more powerful than corticosteroid nose sprays and shouldn't be used for prolonged periods of more than two to four weeks.  Corticosteroids are better than antihistamine tablets at preventing and relieving nasal symptoms, including sneezing and congestion. They can also relieve itchy, watery eyes. They're most effective if you start using them a couple of weeks before your symptoms begin, and work best when used regularly. It's important that you read the instructions that come with your medication, as applying the drops or the spray incorrectly can increase your risk of developing side effects, such as: irritation and dryness of your nose bleeding from your nose unpleasant taste in your mouth itchy skin rash around your nose Corticosteroid tablets If you require rapid short-term relief from severe symptoms \u2013 for example, if you have an exam or driving test coming up \u2013 your GP may prescribe a course of corticosteroid tablets for five to seven days. The use of corticosteroids for longer than 10 days isn't recommended, because the longer you take steroid tablets the more likely it is you'll begin to experience unpleasant side effects, such as: weight gain changes in mood, such as feeling irritable acne  Read more about the different corticosteroid sprays, drops and tablets available. Nasal decongestants Hay fever can cause a blocked nose. A decongestant, in the form of a nasal spray, can relieve this. Decongestants reduce the swelling of the blood vessels in your nose, which opens your nasal passage and makes breathing easier. Your GP can prescribe a nasal decongestant, but there are many available from your pharmacist. Check the ingredients, as some decongestants also contain antihistamine. If they do, they may relieve other symptoms as well. If not, the decongestant will only relieve your blocked nose. Nasal decongestants shouldn't be used for longer than seven days. They may cause dryness and irritation in your nasal passage, and can make the symptoms of congestion worse (this is known as rebound congestion or rhinitis medicamentosa). Read more about nasal decongestants. Eye drops Eye drops are available from your pharmacist to treat the hay fever symptoms that affect your eyes, such as redness, itchiness and watering (allergic conjunctivitis). The drops contain antihistamine, such as azelastine and olopatadine, to reduce the inflammation in your eyes, which will relieve the symptoms. Eye drops containing the active ingredient sodium cromoglicate (a mast cell stabiliser) are the most widely used and have been shown to be extremely safe. Check the patient information leaflet for the correct way to use them. Some may cause side effects, such as a stinging or burning sensation in your eyes.  Immunotherapy If you have persistent hay fever symptoms that aren't relieved by the above treatments, your GP may refer you for immunotherapy treatment. This involves gradually introducing you to small amounts of the allergen (the substance you're allergic to), such as pollen, and monitoring your allergic reaction in a controlled environment. Immunotherapy is only carried out in specialist medical centres, in case a serious allergic reaction, known as anaphylaxis, occurs. The allergen can be given to you as: an injection into your skin \u2013 this is known as systemic injection immunotherapy (SIT) a tablet that dissolves under your tongue \u2013 this is known as sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) After the initial treatment, you'll be monitored for up to an hour. Further doses of SLIT can safely be administered at home after an initial dose has been given under medical supervision. To work in the first year, treatment should be started three months before the pollen season. As you get used to the allergen, the amount used will slowly be increased. You'll gradually start to build up immunity to the allergen, and your allergic reaction to it should get less severe. Three years of treatment is recommended to achieve long-term pollen desensitisation. Immunotherapy can improve your tolerance of the allergen, which can improve your quality of life and have long-term results. However, if you don't see a significant improvement in your symptoms during the first year, then the treatment is unlikely to help and shouldn't be continued.

Around 10,000 new cases are diagnosed in the UK each year. There are more than 30 areas within the head and neck where cancer can develop, including the: mouth (including the lips) voice box (larynx) throat (pharynx)  salivary glands nose and sinuses area at the back of the nose and mouth (nasopharynx) Oesophageal (gullet) cancer, thyroid cancer, brain tumours and eye cancer don't tend to be classified as a head and neck cancer. Mouth cancer Mouth cancer is the most common type of head and neck cancer. It can affect a number of areas in and around the mouth, including the: lips tongue inside of the cheeks floor or roof of the mouth gums Symptoms of mouth cancer can include persistent mouth ulcers and\/or a lump in your mouth, both of which may be painful.  Read more about mouth cancer. Laryngeal cancer Laryngeal cancer develops in the tissue of the larynx (voice box). Symptoms of laryngeal cancer can include: a change in the voice, such as persistent hoarseness difficulty or pain when swallowing noisy breathing shortness of breath a persistent cough a lump or swelling in your neck Read more about laryngeal cancer. Throat cancers Doctors don't tend to use the term \"throat cancer\", as the throat (pharynx) includes many different parts that can be affected by cancer. The main areas that can be affected are the: oropharynx \u2013 the part of the throat at the back of the mouth hypopharynx \u2013 the part of the throat connecting the oropharynx to the gullet and windpipe nasopharynx \u2013 the part of the throat that connects the back of the nose to the back of the mouth (see below) The most common symptoms of cancer in the oropharynx or hypopharynx include a lump in the neck, a persistent sore throat and difficulty swallowing. Macmillan Cancer Support has more information about oropharyngeal cancer. Salivary gland cancer Salivary glands produce saliva, which keeps your mouth moist and helps with swallowing and digestion. There are three main pairs of salivary glands. They are the: parotid glands \u2013 located between your cheeks and your ears sublingual glands \u2013 located under your tongue submandibular glands \u2013 located under each side of your jawbone Salivary gland cancer most commonly affects the parotid glands. The main symptom of salivary gland cancer is a lump or swelling on or near your jaw, or in your mouth or neck, although the vast majority of these lumps are non-cancerous. Other symptoms can include numbness in part of your face and drooping on one side of your face. To read more about salivary gland cancer, visit Cancer Research UK and Macmillan Cancer Support. Nose and sinus cancer Nose and sinus cancer affects the nasal cavity (above the roof of your mouth) and the sinuses (the small, air-filled cavities inside the bones of the nose and within the cheekbones and forehead). The symptoms of nose and sinus cancer are similar to viral or bacterial infections, such as the common cold or sinusitis, and include: a persistent blocked nose, which usually only affects one side nosebleeds a decreased sense of smell mucus running from the nose or down the throat Read more about nose and sinus cancer. Nasopharyngeal cancer Nasopharyngeal cancer affects the part of the throat that connects the back of the nose to the back of the mouth. It's one of the rarest types of head and neck cancer in the UK. Symptoms can include: a lump in the neck, due to the cancer spreading to the lymph nodes (pea-sized lumps of tissue that make up part of the immune system) in the neck a blocked or stuffy nose nosebleeds hearing loss (usually only in one ear) Read more about nasopharyngeal cancer.

The most common causes of head injuries are falls, assaults, and road traffic collisions. Children are more likely to sustain a minor head injury because they're very active. Treating a minor head injury Most people who attend hospital with a minor head injury are allowed to return home shortly afterwards and will make a full recovery within a few days. After attending hospital with a minor head injury, you'll usually be discharged fairly soon and be able to recover at home. Most people will make a full recovery in a few days. For the first 24 hours after the injury, it's important for someone to stay with the injured person to keep an eye out for any new symptoms that develop. It's also important to rest, avoid aggravating the injury with stressful situations, and avoid contact sports until fully recovered. Mild headaches can be treated with paracetamol, but always read the manufacturer's instructions to ensure the correct dosage is taken. Don't give aspirin to children under the age of 16.

This topic focuses on severe head injury. Read about minor head injuries. Symptoms of a severe head injury can include: unconsciousness \u2013 where a person has collapsed and is unresponsive, even for a brief period of time concussion \u2013 a sudden but short-lived loss of mental function that occurs after a blow or other injury to the head; a person with concussion may have a glazed look or appear confused, but won\u2019t necessarily be unconscious  fits or seizures  difficulty speaking or staying awake problems with the senses \u2013 such as hearing loss or double vision repeated episodes of vomiting blood or clear fluid coming from the ears or nose memory loss (amnesia) sudden swelling or bruising around both eyes or behind the ear difficulty with walking or co-ordination Dial 999 immediately to request an ambulance if you're with someone who experiences any of these symptoms after sustaining a head injury.

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is often used to assess head injuries. This is a scale from 3 to 15 that identifies how serious your head injury is, based on your symptoms and whether the brain has been damaged (with 3 being most severe and 15 the least severe). A GCS score of 13 or above would indicate a minor head injury. A score of 9 to 12 would be a moderate head injury. If a person has a severe head injury, they'll have a score of 8 or less. Some people with significant head injuries have a high GCS score initially, but their score decreases when they're reassessed at a later stage. If you have a severe head injury, you\u2019ll be closely monitored and frequently reassessed to check your condition. Read more about how severe head injuries are diagnosed.

Nits are the empty egg cases attached to hair that head lice hatch from. Head lice are a common problem, particularly in school children aged 4-11. They're largely harmless, but can live in the hair for a long time if not treated and can be irritating and frustrating to deal with. This page covers: Spotting head lice Getting rid of head lice and nits How you get head lice Prevention How to spot head lice Head lice can be difficult to spot, even when the head is closely inspected. They're very small whitish or grey-brown insects that range from the size of a pinhead to the size of a sesame seed. The only way to be sure someone has head lice is to find a live louse by combing their hair with a special fine-toothed comb. This is called detection combing. Less reliable signs of head lice include: small white eggs or nits (egg cases) in the hair behind the ears or at back of the neck \u2013 see image above an itchy scalp a rash on the back of the neck feeling as though something is moving in the hair How to get rid of head lice and nits Treatments to get rid of head lice are available to buy from pharmacies, supermarkets and online. You don't usually need to see your GP. The main treatments are: lotions or sprays that kill head lice \u2013 these can be very effective, but some aren't suitable for pregnant or breastfeeding women, or for children under two removing head lice with a specially designed comb \u2013 this is suitable for everyone and relatively inexpensive, but needs to be repeated several times and can take a long time to do thoroughly A pharmacist can advise you about the treatments available if you're not sure which is best for you or your child. Make sure you carefully follow the instructions that come with the treatment you choose. Read more about the treatments for head lice. How you get head lice Head lice are spread by direct head to head contact. They climb from one person's hair to another's. Head lice: can't fly, jump or swim are very unlikely to be spread by objects such as hats, combs and pillows don't have a preference for dirty, clean, short or long hair only affect people and can't be caught from animals Once detached from the hair, head lice will usually die within 12-24 hours. Preventing head lice It's very difficult to prevent head lice. You may want to consider regular detection combing \u2013 for example, on a weekly basis \u2013 if you're concerned about your children or yourself. Lotions and sprays don't prevent head lice and should only be used if a live louse has been found in your or your child's hair. Staying off work or school and washing clothing and bedding on a hot wash is unnecessary, as it's unlikely to help prevent the spread of head lice.

If a treatment doesn't work the first time, you can try it again, try a different treatment, or get advice from your school nurse, health visitor, pharmacist or GP. Lotions and sprays There are several different products that can be applied to the scalp and hair to kill head lice, including: dimeticone 4% lotion or lotion spray \u2013 applied and left for 8 hours (usually overnight) dimeticone 4% spray gel \u2013 applied and left for 15 minutes mineral oil and dimeticone spray \u2013 applied and left for 15 minutes isopropyl myristate and cyclomethicone solution \u2013 applied and left for 5-10 minutes Some treatments need be done twice \u2013 seven days apart \u2013 to make sure any newly-hatched lice are killed. Detection combing should usually be done two or three days after finishing treatment, and again another seven days after that, to check for any live head lice. Always check the pack or leaflet to see if a product is suitable for you, particularly if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, or your child has head lice and is less than two years of age. Your pharmacist can recommend a suitable treatment and advise you how to use it correctly if necessary. Wet combing Wet combing involves removing head lice with a special fine-toothed comb. It's suitable for everyone and is relatively inexpensive. A number of lice removal combs are available to buy. Combs with flat-faced teeth spaced 0.2-0.3mm apart are best for removing head lice, although combs with smaller gaps can be used to remove eggs and nits (egg cases) after treatment. The comb may come with instructions outlining how to use it. A commonly used method is described below. Wash the hair with ordinary shampoo and apply plenty of conditioner. Use an ordinary, wide-toothed comb to straighten and untangle the hair. Once the comb moves freely through the hair without dragging, switch to the louse detection comb. Make sure the teeth of the comb slot into the hair at the roots, with the edge of the teeth lightly touching the scalp. Draw the comb down from the roots to the ends of the hair with every stroke, and check the comb for lice each time \u2013 remove lice by wiping the comb with tissue paper or rinsing it. Work through the hair, section by section, so that the whole head of hair is combed through. Do this at least twice to help ensure you haven't missed any areas, until no more lice are found. Repeat this procedure on days five, nine and 13. Detection combing  should be done on day 17, to check for any live head lice. Treatments not recommended The following treatments aren't recommended because they're unlikely to be effective: products containing permethrin head lice \"repellents\" electric head lice combs tree and plant oil treatments, such as tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, and lavender oil herbal remedies There's also no need to stay off work or school or wash clothing and laundry on a hot wash, as this is unlikely to be useful.

But most aren't serious and are easily treated. In many cases, you can treat your headaches at home with over-the-counter painkillers and lifestyle changes, such as getting more rest and drinking enough fluids. However, it's a good idea to see your GP if your headaches aren't relieved by over-the-counter treatments, or if they're so painful or frequent that they affect your daily activities or are causing you to miss work. This page covers: Tension headaches Migraines Cluster headaches Medication and painkiller headaches Hormone headaches Other causes of headaches Signs of a serious problem Tension headaches Tension headaches are the most common type of headache and are what we think of as normal, \"everyday\" headaches. They feel like a constant ache that affects both sides of the head, as though a tight band is stretched around it. A tension headache normally won't be severe enough to prevent you doing everyday activities. They usually last for 30 minutes to several hours, but can last for several days. The exact cause is unclear, but tension headaches have been linked to things such as stress, poor posture, skipping meals and dehydration. Tension headaches can usually be treated with ordinary painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen. Lifestyle changes, such as getting regular sleep, reducing stress and staying well hydrated, may also help. Read more about tension headaches. Migraines Migraines are less common than tension headaches. They're usually felt as a severe, throbbing pain at the front or side of the head. Some people also have other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and increased sensitivity to light or sound. Migraines tend to be more severe than tension headaches and can stop you carrying out your normal daily activities. They usually last at least a couple of hours, and some people find they need to stay in bed for days at a time. Most people can treat their migraines successfully with over-the-counter medication. But if they're severe, you may need stronger medication that's only available on prescription. This may be able to relieve and prevent your migraines. Read more about migraines. Cluster headaches Cluster headaches are a rare type of headache that occur in clusters for a month or two at a time around the same time of year. They're excruciatingly painful, causing intense pain around one eye, and often occur with other symptoms, such as a watering or red eye and a blocked or runny nose. Pharmacy medications don't ease the symptoms of a cluster headache, but a doctor can prescribe specific treatments to ease the pain and help prevent further attacks. Read more about cluster headaches. Medication and painkiller headaches Some headaches are a side effect of taking a particular medication. Frequent headaches can also be caused by taking too many painkillers. This is known as a painkiller or medication-overuse headache. A medication-overuse headache will usually get better within a few weeks once you stop taking the painkillers that are causing it, although your pain may get worse for a few days before it starts to improve. Read more about painkiller headaches. Hormone headaches Headaches in women are often caused by hormones, and many women notice a link with their periods. The combined contraceptive pill, the menopause and pregnancy are also potential triggers. Reducing your stress levels, having a regular sleeping pattern, and ensuring you don't miss meals may help reduce headaches associated with your menstrual cycle. Read more about hormone headaches. Other causes of headaches Headaches can also have a number of other causes, including: drinking too much alcohol a head injury or concussion a cold or flu temporomandibular disorders \u2013 problems affecting the \"chewing\" muscles and the joints between the lower jaw and the base of the skull sinusitis \u2013 inflammation of the lining of the sinuses; read more about sinus headaches carbon monoxide poisoning sleep apnoea \u2013 a condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing Click on the links above for more information about these conditions. Could it be something serious? In the vast majority of cases, a headache isn't a sign of a serious problem. But, rarely, it can be a symptom of a condition such as a stroke, meningitis, or a brain tumour. A headache is more likely to be serious if: it occurs suddenly and is very severe \u2013 often described as a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before it doesn't go away and gets worse over time it occurs after a severe head injury it's triggered suddenly by coughing, laughing, sneezing, changes in posture, or physical exertion you have symptoms suggesting a problem with your brain or nervous system, including weakness, slurred speech, confusion, memory loss, and drowsiness you have additional symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever), a stiff neck, a rash, jaw pain while chewing, vision problems, a sore scalp, or severe pain and redness in one of your eyes If you're concerned that your headache might be serious, you should seek immediate medical advice. Contact your GP or NHS 111 as soon as possible, or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department.

They're estimated to affect around 1 in 500-1,000 people. Anyone of any age can be affected, but they're more common in men and tend to develop in people over the age of 20. It's not clear exactly what causes cluster headaches, but they've been linked to activity in part of the brain called the hypothalamus. People who smoke seem to be at a higher risk. Some cases also appear to run in families, which suggests there may be a genetic link. For most people, cluster headaches occur in recurrent \"bouts\" over several weeks (typically 4-12 weeks) followed by headache-free periods (remission) that often last for months, or sometimes years. Cluster headache bouts may occur every year over many years and may be lifelong. In general, they become less frequent over time. Treatment is available to control them. Symptoms of a cluster headache Cluster headaches begin suddenly and without warning. The pain is very severe and is often described as a sharp, burning or piercing sensation on one side of the head. The pain is typically felt around the eye, temple and sometimes face, and typically recurs on the same side for each attack. Often people feel restless and agitated during an attack because the pain is so intense, and may react by rocking, pacing or banging their head against the wall. They commonly also have at least one of the following associated symptoms: a red and watering eye  drooping and swelling of one eyelid a smaller pupil in one eye a sweaty face a blocked or runny nostril a red ear These attacks generally last between 15 minutes and three hours, and typically occur between one and eight times a day. Pattern of attacks Cluster headaches usually occur every day, in bouts lasting several weeks or months at a time, before they subside. Remission will often follow, which sometimes lasts months or years before the headaches start again. During a cluster headache bout, the headaches often occur at the same time each day. For example, people often wake up with a headache within a couple of hours of going to sleep. The attacks also seem to recur at similar times of the year, most often in spring and autumn. Some people notice certain triggers for their headaches during a period of attacks, such as: drinking alcohol warm temperatures exercise strong smells, such as perfume, paint or petrol Cluster headache bouts separated by a remission period of one month or more are known as episodic cluster headaches. Those separated by a remission period of less than one month, or present for at least 12 months without remission, are known as chronic cluster headaches. About 10-20% of cluster headache cases are chronic. Seeking medical advice You should see your GP as soon as possible the first time you experience what you think may be a cluster headache. They will ask you about your symptoms and may refer you for tests. In some people a brain scan is needed to exclude other conditions that can have similar symptoms to cluster headaches. Typically, in cluster headaches the brain scan is normal and the diagnosis is made on the basis of your symptoms without the need for tests. If you're diagnosed with cluster headaches, you will usually see a specialist such as a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nerves) to talk about your treatment options. Treating cluster headaches Cluster headaches aren't life threatening, but they can cause significant suffering and severely affect your quality of life, so it's important to see someone who is familiar with the known effective treatments for the condition. The headaches can't be treated with over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol, as these are too slow to take effect. You'll need to have one or more specialist treatments instead. Three main treatments are available to relieve pain when taken soon after a cluster headache starts. These are: sumatriptan injections, which you can give yourself up to twice a day sumatriptan or zolmitriptan nasal spray, which can be used if you would prefer not to have injections oxygen therapy, where you breathe pure oxygen through a mask \u2013 read more about home oxygen treatment These treatments usually relieve the pain of a cluster headache within 15-30 minutes. Preventing cluster headaches Your doctor may also prescribe medication to prevent cluster headaches during a headache bout. This involves starting treatment as soon as the headaches begin and continuing it until the bout is thought to have stopped. The main treatment recommended to prevent cluster headaches is a medication called verapamil, which is taken as a tablet several times a day. You'll need to be monitored by the doctor treating you with a test called an electrocardiogram (ECG) while taking this medication, as it can cause heart problems in some people. Alternative treatments may be considered if verapamil is not effective. These may include corticosteroids, lithium medication and occipital nerve blocks (injections of a local anaesthetic into the back of the head). There is now also a promising new treatment that uses a device to stimulate a nerve in the neck to prevent cluster headaches. This is known as external vagal nerve stimulation. Preventative treatments can vary in effectiveness from person to person. A few different treatments may need to be tried before your attacks are under control. Support groups Living with cluster headaches can be extremely difficult, so you may find it useful to seek further advice and support from organisations such as OUCH (UK).

They are felt as a dull, throbbing pain in the upper face. Many people assume they have a sinus headache, when in fact it's much more likely to be either a migraine or tension-type headache. It's important to see your GP if you have any type of bad headache that you cannot control with over-the-counter medicine, particularly if it lasts a week or more, so you can get a proper diagnosis and treatment. What causes sinus headaches? The sinuses are small air spaces in the skull, found behind the nose, eyes and cheeks. They open out into the nose, allowing mucus to drain and air to circulate normally. When the lining of the nose and upper airways becomes infected \u2013 for example, with a cold \u2013 the infection can spread to the sinuses and cause them to become swollen. The small opening from the sinuses to the nose can become blocked, which leads to a build-up of pressure inside the sinuses. This is known as sinusitis. For some people with sinusitis, the pressure builds up to such an extent that it causes pain, or a sinus headache. You may feel stuffy and congested for a while, but it normally gets better once the cold goes away. Sinusitis and sinus headaches can last much longer. This usually only happens if bacteria infect the trapped mucus, or your sinuses repeatedly swell up because of an allergy. Symptoms of a sinus headache A sinus headache is a constant, throbbing pain felt in the face (around the eyes, cheeks and forehead), usually only on one side. It tends to be at its worst first thing in the morning and may get better by the afternoon. The pain may get worse when you move your head, strain or bend down, and when you experience extreme changes in temperature (such as going from a warm room into freezing air outside). It can also spread to your teeth, upper jaw and other parts of your head. Your face may feel swollen and tender to the touch, and you will also have other symptoms of sinusitis, such as green or yellow mucus discharge from your nose and a high temperature (fever). The symptoms of a sinus headache can be very similar to those of a migraine and tension-type headache, so it can sometimes be hard to tell which you have, but sinus headaches occur with other sinusitis symptoms, such as fever and nasal discharge. Generally, if you have facial pain or a headache, but no other symptoms of sinusitis, you're more likely to have a migraine or tension-type headache. Treating a sinus headache If you have mild symptoms, you may be able to treat them at home by: resting and drinking plenty of fluids taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen using over-the-counter decongestant nasal sprays or drops to help unblock your nose \u2013 although these shouldn't be used for more than a week at a time holding a warm flannel to your affected sinuses for a few minutes, and repeating this several times a day flushing the inside of your nose with a saline nasal spray or solution available from your pharmacist \u2013 this can help to reduce swelling in the sinuses by cleaning out mucus, bacteria and any allergy-causing particles When to see your GP See your GP if your headache doesn't improve after a week, gets worse, or keeps coming back. Your GP may recommend: antibiotics \u2013 if a bacterial infection is thought to be the cause of your symptoms antihistamines \u2013 if an allergy is thought to be the cause of your symptoms corticosteroid sprays or drops to reduce the swelling in your sinuses In some cases, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist, who will carry out some tests to find the underlying cause of your symptoms. If no other treatments help, your ENT specialist may recommend surgery to improve the drainage of your sinuses. Read more about treating sinusitis.

You may also feel the neck muscles tighten and a feeling of pressure behind the eyes. A tension headache normally won't be severe enough to prevent you doing everyday activities. It usually lasts for 30 minutes to several hours, but can last for several days. Who gets tension headaches? Most people are likely to have experienced a tension headache at some point. They can develop at any age, but are more common in teenagers and adults. Women tend to suffer from them more commonly than men. It's estimated that about half the adults in the UK experience tension-type headaches once or twice a month, and about 1 in 3 get them up to 15 times a month. About 2 or 3 in every 100 adults experience tension-type headaches more than 15 times a month for at least three months in a row. This is known as having chronic tension-type headaches. When to seek medical help There's usually no need to see your GP if you only get occasional headaches. However, see your GP if you get headaches several times a week or your headaches are severe. Your GP will ask questions about your headaches, family history, diet and lifestyle to help diagnose the type of headache you have. You should seek immediate medical advice for headaches that: come on suddenly and are unlike anything you've had before are accompanied by a very stiff neck, fever, nausea, vomiting and confusion follow an accident, especially if it involved a blow to your head are accompanied by weakness, numbness, slurred speech or confusion These symptoms suggest there could be a more serious problem, which may require further investigation and emergency treatment. What causes tension headaches? The exact cause of tension-type headaches isn't clear, but certain things have been known to trigger them, including: stress and anxiety squinting poor posture tiredness dehydration missing meals lack of physical activity bright sunlight noise certain smells Tension-type headaches are known as primary headaches, which means they're not caused by an underlying condition. Other primary headaches include cluster headaches and migraines. How are tension headaches treated? Tension-type headaches aren't life-threatening and are usually relieved by painkillers or lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes Relaxation techniques can often help with stress-related headaches. This may include: yoga massage exercise applying a hot flannel to your forehead and neck Read more about relaxation tips to help with stress. Painkillers Painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to help relieve pain. Aspirin may also sometimes be recommended. If you're taking these medications, you should always follow the instructions on the packet. Pregnant women shouldn't take ibuprofen during the third trimester, as it could risk harming the baby, and children under 16 shouldn't be given aspirin. Medication shouldn't be taken for more than a few days at a time and medication containing codeine, such as co-codamol, should be avoided unless recommended by a GP. Painkiller headaches Taking painkillers over a long period (usually 10 days or more) may lead to medication-overuse headaches developing. Your body can get used to the medication and a headache can develop if you stop taking them.  If your GP suspects your headache is caused by the persistent use of medication, they may ask you to stop taking it. However, you shouldn't stop taking your medication without first consulting your GP. Read more about painkiller headaches. Preventing tension headaches If you experience frequent tension-type headaches, you may wish to keep a diary to try to identify what could be triggering them. It may then be possible to alter your diet or lifestyle to prevent them occurring as often. Regular exercise and relaxation are also important measures to help reduce stress and tension that may be causing headaches. Maintaining good posture and ensuring you're well rested and hydrated can also help. Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states that a course of up to 10 sessions of acupuncture over a 5-8 week period may be beneficial in preventing chronic tension-type headaches. In some cases, an antidepressant medication called amitriptyline may be prescribed to help prevent chronic tension-type headaches, although there's limited evidence of its effectiveness. This medication doesn't treat a headache instantly, but must be taken daily for several months until the headaches lessen.

But for some people, health worries become overwhelming and a problem in itself. Hypochondria (health anxiety) is excessive worrying about your health, to the point where it causes great distress and affects your everyday life. Some people with health anxiety have a medical condition, which they worry about excessively. Others have medically unexplained symptoms, such as chest pain or headaches, which they are concerned may be a sign of a serious illness, despite the doctor's reassurance. Others may be permanently anxious about their future health, worrying about things like: \"What if I get cancer or heart disease?\" What causes health anxiety? There are many reasons why someone worries too much about their health. You may be going through a particularly stressful period of your life. There may have been illness or death in your family, or another family member may have worried a lot about your health when you were young. Personality can be a factor. You may be vulnerable to health anxiety because you are a worrier generally. You may find it difficult to handle emotions and conflict, and tend to \"catastrophise\" when faced with problems in your life. Sometimes, health anxiety can be a symptom of a mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety disorder, which needs recognising and treating in its own right (see below). Types of health anxiety People with health anxiety can fall into one of two extremes: Constantly seeking information and reassurance \u2013 for example, obsessively researching illnesses from the internet, booking frequent GP appointments, and having frequent tests that don't find any problems. Avoidant behaviour \u2013 avoiding medical TV programmes, GP appointments and anything else that might trigger the anxiety, and avoiding activities such as exercise that are perceived to make the condition worse. Neither of these behaviours are helpful, and need addressing if you are to break the vicious circle of health anxiety. Health anxiety can be a vicious circle If you constantly check your body for signs of illness, such as a rash or bump, you will eventually find something. It often won't be anything serious \u2013 it could be a natural body change, or you could be misinterpreting signs of anxiety (such as increased heart rate and sweating) as signs of a serious condition. However, the discovery tends to cause great anxiety and make you self-check even more. You may find yourself needing more reassurance from doctors, friends and family. The comfort you get from this reassurance may be short-lived, or you may stop believing it, which only means you need more of it to feel better. Seeking reassurance just keeps the symptoms in your head, and usually makes you feel worse. When physical symptoms are triggered or made worse by worrying, it causes even more anxiety, which just worsens the symptoms. Excessive worrying can also lead to panic attacks or even depression. Have I got health anxiety? If you can answer \"yes\" to most of the following questions, it's likely that you are affected by health anxiety and might benefit from talking to your GP. During the past six months: Have you been preoccupied with having a serious illness because of body symptoms, which has lasted at least six months? Have you felt distressed due to this preoccupation? Have you found that this preoccupation impacts negatively on all areas of life, including family life, social life and work? Have you needed to carry out constant self-examination and self-diagnosis? Have you experienced disbelief over a diagnosis from a doctor, or felt you are unconvinced by your doctor's reassurances that you are fine? Do you constantly need reassurance from doctors, family and friends that you are fine, even if you don't really believe what you are being told? How your GP can help Once your GP has established that you do suffer from health anxiety, and there is no serious underlying physical cause for any symptoms you might have, they should investigate whether you might have a problem, such as depression or anxiety disorder, that may be causing or worsening your symptoms.  If this is the case, you may be referred for psychological therapy and you may benefit from antidepressants (see below). If this is not the case, the aim should still be to help you become less worried about your health. You may find that your GP's advice and self-help resources (see below) are all you need to start feeling better, or you may still benefit from a referral for psychological therapy. Psychological therapy Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for many people with health anxiety. It involves working with a trained CBT therapist to identify the thoughts and emotions you experience and the things you do to cope with them, with the aim of changing unhealthy thoughts and behaviours that maintain health anxiety. CBT looks at how to challenge the way you interpret symptoms, to encourage a more balanced and realistic view. It should help you to: learn what seems to make the symptoms worse develop methods of coping with the symptoms keep yourself more active, even if you still have symptoms However, CBT is not the best treatment for everyone with health anxiety. Some people may benefit more from a different psychological therapy, such as trauma-focused therapy or a psychotherapy that will help a particular psychological condition. Accurate assessment is needed to select the right treatment for you and for your problem, so, if necessary, you may be referred to a mental health specialist for this next step.  Medication Antidepressants may be helpful if you have a mental health condition such as depression. For some people, these may work better than CBT. Your GP can directly prescribe antidepressants or refer you to a mental health specialist for treatment. However, treating your symptoms with medication is not always the answer and the possible benefits of medication always need to be weighed against the potential negative effects. Helping yourself There's lots you can do to help yourself. A good first step would be to read the NHS Health Anxiety leaflet, which can be downloaded from the Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS website. This is just one of many self-help guides available. It provides advice and exercises you can try yourself, such as keeping a diary of your preoccupations and symptoms, and counteracting them with realistic and rational thinking.

The NHS Health Check is based on the best scientific evidence from Britain and around the world and can transform people's lives. It provides a rare opportunity to sit down with a health professional and talk about your health requirements. Afterwards, you will be more confident and know more about your health. You should also receive a wellness plan, tailored specifically to your needs.  \u201CThe NHS Health Check is free and should not be missed,\" says Sir Muir Gray, Chief Knowledge Officer of the NHS. \u201CIt will give you the knowledge you need to take control of your health\u201D. Goes to the heart of things Our bodies have many important systems, but one that is central to all of them is our vascular or circulatory system. At its centre is our heart, pumping blood every second of every day through a 100,000-mile network of veins and arteries, which, if lined up end to end, would circle the equator four times.  It\u2019s not only a system that all others depend on, but one that suffers wear and tear. This can lead to a range of debilitating, sometimes life-threatening, conditions such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of dementia. Together, these conditions are the biggest cause of preventable deaths and disability in the UK. The vascular system is what the NHS Health Check is designed to monitor and protect. It tells you how well your vascular system is performing and predicts how it will hold up in the future. Most importantly, it points out changes you can make to get your vascular system running more efficiently, which will reduce wear and tear. \u201COne of the wonderful things about the vascular system is that there are many things we as individuals can do to improve its functioning,\u201D says Sir Muir. \u201CThis test is not just giving you important results. It\u2019s giving you results you can act on.\u201D   Find out more about the vascular system and diseases. Find out more about the NHS Health Check tests. If you're over 30, take the online heart age test now to see how healthy your heart is. Learn your vital stats The NHS Health Check gives you an overall score that you can keep track of and improve over time. Some think of this as their \u201Cheart age\u201D. This single figure is calculated from up to 20 other snippets of information about you, but there are three important statistics that you should know and, from time to time, monitor. These are your: blood pressure BMI (body mass index) cholesterol count  \u201CI liked coming away from the NHS Health Check with facts about my health,\u201D says Peter, a 50-year-old from London. \u201CI roughly knew my BMI, but I had no idea about my blood pressure or cholesterol. My cholesterol was high, but I changed my diet and now it\u2019s normal again.\u201D   Find out what to expect on the day of your NHS Health Check. Find out more about interpreting your results. Read how Bala, 67, changed his lifestyle and brought his cholesterol level down after his NHS Health Check. Get an action plan As important as the NHS Health Check is, the action plan for health improvement that comes with it is the real game changer. Some people end up with a NHS Health Check score that is better than normal and no changes will be necessary. But for most of us, some change will be recommended. For example, you may be advised to be more physically active or cut down on the amount of fat, salt or sugar in your diet. If your NHS Health Check suggests you are at higher risk, you might also be offered medicines to control your blood pressure or lower your cholesterol, along with help to take action with losing weight or stopping smoking. Tailored support If there are changes you need to make, you will be offered a tailored plan and support for meeting your goals. This will vary depending on where you live, and there are some excellent resources available. For example, in Buckinghamshire, one NHS Health Check attendee lost four stone after being referred to a specialist weight loss programme.  Meanwhile, in Richmond, London, people having NHS Health Checks have embarked on a range of lifestyle services, depending on their needs, including alcohol and stop smoking services, and a diabetes prevention programme. John Goodall, Public Health Wiltshire, says: \"The NHS Health Check is much more than a check-up. \"It gives you a plan of action to improve your health over time, with someone who is well placed to advise and encourage you to make healthy changes.\" If you live in Wiltshire and you're found to be at higher risk, you could also benefit from the council's Active Health programme and other health services. Your GP or health care professional can refer you to specially trained exercise professionals based at local leisure centres, who will devise an individual programme for you. John Goodall, from Public Health Wiltshire, says: \u201CThe NHS Health Check is much more than just a check-up. It gives you a plan of action to improve your health over time, by providing you with a one-to-one interaction with someone who is well placed to advise and encourage you to make healthy changes.\"  \"If you're already leading a healthy life and are at low risk, that's marvellous. In Wiltshire, everyone attending an NHS Health Check should receive individual advice and support, whatever their risk. They\u2019ll also get a lifestyle leaflet, which includes an array of local activity programmes they can join.\" Get more advice on taking action to improve your NHS Health Check results.

There's little joy in living to the age of 100 or more if we have to spend many years being treated for serious conditions that can affect our quality of life and stop us doing the things that make us happy. By getting an NHS Health Check, knowing your results and making changes that will help you lead a healthy life, you can look forward to: More time with family and friends By attending your NHS Health Check and making healthy changes, you're more likely to live longer and have more time with your friends and family. This includes having more time to watch any children and grandchildren grow up. Living independently for longer By keeping healthy, you can live independently in your own home for longer. This means you'll be less likely to need extra social care and support from other people, including members of your family. If you have to spend many years in a state of ill-health, your quality of life will be affected. Improved emotional wellbeing Being unwell over a long period of time can significantly reduce our chances of being able to do the things that make us happy, like seeing other people, playing sports and taking part in activities, such as volunteering or having hobbies. Keeping healthy is good for our emotional as well as physical wellbeing. Staying in work for longer Good health improves your chances of finding and staying in work, and being in work is generally beneficial for our health, as well as benefiting our self-esteem and our wallets. On the other hand, being unwell can affect our ability to find and stay in work, which can lead to money worries and emotional stress.

When should I introduce my baby to solid foods? Media last reviewed: 28\/01\/2015 Next review due: 28\/01\/2017 When to start introducing solid foods Introducing your baby to solid foods \u2013 sometimes called weaning or complementary feeding \u2013 should start when your baby is around six months old. It's a really important step in their development, and it can be great fun to explore new flavours and textures together. To begin with, how much your baby takes is less important than getting them used to the idea of eating. They will still be getting most of their nutrition from breast milk or infant formula.  Babies don't need three meals a day to start with, so you can begin by offering foods at a time that suits you both. Gradually, you'll be able to increase the amount and variety of food your baby eats, until they can eventually eat the same as the rest of the family, in smaller portions. Why it pays to wait until they're ready Research shows babies can get all the nutrients they need from breast milk or infant formula until they are around six months old. Waiting till then gives their digestive system time to develop fully so it can cope with solid foods. This includes solid foods made into purées and cereals added to milk. If you are breastfeeding, having breast milk alone up to the age of six months will protect your baby against infections. Breast milk will carry on protecting them from infections for as long as you carry on feeding. Whether your baby has breast milk or infant formula, waiting until they are ready for food will save a lot of time, too. They'll quickly be able to feed themselves and with less mess, as they will be able to swallow properly. Three signs your baby is ready for their first food Every baby is an individual, but there are three clear signs that, together, show your baby is ready for solid foods alongside breast milk or formula. It's very rare for these signs to appear together before your baby is six months old. 1. They can stay in a sitting position and hold their head steady. 2. They can co-ordinate their eyes, hands and mouth so they can look at the food, pick it up and put it in their mouth, all by themselves. 3. They can swallow food. Babies who are not ready will push their food back out with their tongue, so they get more round their face than they do in their mouths. Some signs that can be mistaken for a baby being ready for solid foods: chewing fists waking in the night when they have previously slept through wanting extra milk feeds These are normal behaviours and not necessarily a sign of hunger or being ready to start solid food. Starting solid foods won't make them any more likely to sleep through the night. Extra feeds are usually enough until they're ready for other food. Getting started with solid foods Always stay with your baby when they are eating in case they start to choke. Find out how to help a choking child. Let your baby enjoy touching and holding the food. Allow your baby to feed themselves, using their fingers, as soon as they show an interest. Don't force your baby to eat \u2013 wait until the next time if they're not interested this time. If you're using a spoon, wait for your baby to open their mouth before you offer the food. Your baby may like to hold a spoon, too. Start by offering just a few pieces or teaspoons of food, once a day. Cool hot food and test it before giving it to your baby. Don't add salt, sugar or stock cubes to your baby's food or cooking water. See what other foods to avoid giving your baby. What foods to give your baby as they grow Feeding your baby from 0-6 months Your baby only needs breast milk or first infant formula. \"Follow-on\" formula isn't suitable for babies under six months, and you don't need to introduce it after six months either. Check with your health visitor or GP first if you want to introduce solid foods before six months. Babies and food allergies While variety in your baby's diet is really important, there is a chance they may be allergic to certain foods. That's why it's important to introduce cows' milk, eggs, wheat, gluten, nuts, peanuts, peanut products, seeds, fish and shellfish one at a time and not before six months. There is no evidence that waiting until your child is older will prevent them developing a food allergy. Once your baby is ready for solids, give them these foods in very small amounts and watch carefully for any symptoms of an allergic reaction. If your baby already has a known allergy, such as a diagnosed food allergy or eczema, or you have a family history of food allergies, eczema, asthma or hay fever, you may need to be particularly careful when introducing peanuts and peanut products. Talk to your GP or health visitor first. Remember, peanuts, like all nuts, should be crushed or ground. See more about food allergies in babies and toddlers. Baby food from 6 months First foods Your baby's first foods can include mashed or soft cooked fruit and vegetables like parsnip, potato, yam, sweet potato, carrot, apple or pear, all cooled before eating. Soft fruits like peach or melon, or baby rice or baby cereal mixed with your baby's usual milk, are good as well. Keep feeding your baby breast milk or infant formula, too, but don't give them whole cows' milk as a drink until they are one year old. Finger foods Finger food is food that is cut up into pieces big enough for your baby to hold in their fist with a bit sticking out. Pieces about the size of your own finger work well. Your baby learns to chew this way. Try grabbable bits of soft, ripe banana or avocado. Next foods  Once your baby is used to the foods above, they can have soft cooked meat such as chicken, mashed fish (check very carefully for any bones), pasta, noodles, toast, pieces of chapatti, lentils, rice and mashed hard-boiled eggs. They can also have full-fat dairy products such as yoghurt, fromage frais or custard. Choose products with no added sugar or less sugar. Whole cows' milk can be used in cooking or mixed with food from six months. Cups Introduce a cup from around six months and offer sips of water with meals. Using an open cup or a free-flow cup without a valve will help your baby learn to sip and is better for their teeth. See more about cups for babies and toddlers. Vitamins The Department of Health recommends that all under-fives are given vitamin supplements containing vitamins A, C and D every day.  Babies who are having more than 500ml (about a pint) of infant formula a day shouldn't be given vitamin supplements because formula is already fortified with nutrients. Read more about vitamins for babies and toddlers. Feeding your baby from 8-9 months Your baby will gradually move towards eating three meals a day. It will be a mixture of soft finger foods, and mashed or chopped foods. Your baby's diet should consist of a variety of the following: fruit and vegetables; bread, rice, pasta, potatoes and other starchy foods; meat, fish, eggs, beans and other non-dairy sources of protein; and milk and dairy products. See advice on portion size (PDF, 3.6Mb) from First Steps Nutrition. Your baby's food from 12 months Your baby will now be eating three meals a day, chopped if necessary, plus breast milk or whole cows' milk and healthier snacks like fruit, vegetable sticks, toast and rice cakes. They can now drink whole cows' milk. Choose full-fat dairy products as children under two need the extra fat and vitamins found in them. From two years old, if they are a good eater and growing well, they can have semi-skimmed milk. From five years old, 1% fat and skimmed milk is OK. You can give your baby: three to four servings a day of starchy food such as potatoes, bread and rice three to four servings a day of fruit and vegetables two servings a day of meat, fish, eggs, dhal or other pulses (beans and lentils) Read more about what to feed young children. What milk, when? For around the first six months you should feed your baby only breast milk or infant formula. Infant formula made from cows' or goats' milk is the only suitable alternative to breast milk in the first 12 months of your baby's life. Only use soya-based infant formula if your GP has advised you to. Follow-on milks are available for babies over six months, but there is no need to change over to these. Cows' milk can be mixed with food from six months and whole cows' milk can be given as a drink from one year. Semi-skimmed milk can be introduced once your child is two years old, as long as they're a good eater and they have a varied diet. Skimmed and 1% milk aren't suitable for children under five, as they don't contain enough calories. Infant formula, follow-on formula or growing-up milks are not needed once your baby is 12 months old. Goats' and sheep's milk are not suitable as a drink for babies under one year. You can give your child unsweetened calcium-fortified milk alternatives, such as soya, almond and oat drinks, as part of a healthy, balanced diet from the age of one. Toddlers and young children under the age of five should not be given rice drinks because of the levels of arsenic they contain. If your child has an allergy or intolerance to milk, talk to your health visitor or GP. They can advise you on suitable milk alternatives. See more about drinks for babies and toddlers.

Eating healthily during pregnancy will help your baby to develop and grow. You can read through this article, or go directly to the sections you want by clicking these links: Fruit and vegetables Starchy foods (carbohydrates) Protein Dairy Foods that are high in sugar or fat Healthy snacks Preparing food safely Healthy Start vouchers You don't need to go on a special diet, but it's important to eat a variety of different foods every day to get the right balance of nutrients that you and your baby need.  It's best to get vitamins and minerals from the foods you eat, but when you're pregnant you need to take some supplements as well, to make sure you get everything you need. Read more about vitamins and supplements in pregnancy.  There are also certain foods that should be avoided in pregnancy. You will probably find that you are hungrier than usual, but you don't need to \"eat for two\" \u2013 even if you are expecting twins or triplets. Have a healthy breakfast every day, because this can help you to avoid snacking on foods that are high in fat and sugar. Eating healthily often means just changing the amounts of different foods you eat so that your diet is varied, rather than cutting out all your favourites. You can use the Eatwell Guide to get the balance of your diet right. The eatwell plate shows you how much to eat from each food group. You will need to be careful with your diet if you develop gestational diabetes \u2013 your doctor or midwife will advise you. Fruit and vegetables in pregnancy Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables because these provide vitamins and minerals, as well as fibre, which helps digestion and can help prevent constipation. Eat at least five portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day \u2013 these can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced. Always wash fresh fruit and vegetables carefully. Find out what counts as a portion of fruit or vegetables. Starchy foods (carbohydrates) in pregnancy Starchy foods are an important source of energy, vitamins and fibre, and are satisfying without containing too many calories. They include bread, potatoes, breakfast cereals, rice, pasta, noodles, maize, millet, oats, sweet potatoes, yams and cornmeal. These foods should make up just over a third of the food you eat. Choose wholegrain instead of processed (white) varieties, or potatoes with their skins on, when you can as they contain more fibre. Protein in pregnancy Eat some protein foods every day. Sources of protein include: beans  pulses  fish  eggs meat (but avoid liver)  poultry  nuts Choose lean meat, remove the skin from poultry, and try not to add extra fat or oil when cooking meat. Read more about eating meat in a healthy way. Make sure eggs, poultry, burgers, sausages and whole cuts of meat such as lamb, beef and pork are cooked all the way through. Check that there is no pink meat, and that juices have no pink or red in them. Try to eat two portions of fish a week, one of which should be oily fish such as salmon, sardines or mackerel. Find out about the health benefits of fish and shellfish. There are some types of fish you should avoid in pregnancy. For more information, see Foods to avoid in pregnancy.  Dairy in pregnancy Dairy foods such as milk, cheese, fromage frais and yoghurt are important in pregnancy, because they contain calcium and other nutrients that your baby needs. Choose low-fat varieties wherever possible, such as semi-skimmed or skimmed milk, low-fat lower-sugar yoghurt and reduced-fat hard cheese. Aim for two to three portions a day. If you prefer dairy alternatives, such as soya drinks and yoghurts, go for unsweetened, calcium-fortified versions. For more information, read about the nutritional benefits of milk and dairy foods. There are some cheeses you should avoid in pregnancy. To find out which ones, see Foods to avoid in pregnancy. Foods that are high in fat, sugar or both These include: all spreading fats (such as butter) oils salad dressings cream chocolate crisps biscuits pastries ice cream cake puddings fizzy drinks If you're having foods and drinks that are high in fat and sugar, have these less often and in small amounts.  Sugary foods and drinks are often high in calories which can contribute to weight gain. Having sugary foods and drinks can also lead to tooth decay.  Fat is very high in calories, so eating too many fatty foods or eating them too often can make you put on weight. Having too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases the chance of developing heart disease. Try to cut down on saturated fat, and have small amounts of foods rich in unsaturated fat instead. Find out about saturated and unsaturated fat. Healthy snacks in pregnancy If you get hungry between meals, try not to eat snacks that are high in fat and\/or sugar, such as sweets, biscuits, crisps or chocolate. Instead, choose something healthier, such as: sandwiches or pitta bread filled with grated cheese, lean ham, mashed tuna, salmon, or sardines, with salad salad vegetables, such as carrot, celery or cucumber low-fat lower-sugar plain yoghurt or fromage frais with fruit hummus with wholemeal pitta bread or vegetable sticks ready-to-eat apricots, figs or prunes vegetable and bean soups unsweetened breakfast cereals, or porridge, with milk milky drinks fresh fruit baked beans on toast or a baked potato Here are some more ideas for healthy food swaps. Preparing food safely Wash fruit, vegetables and salads to remove all traces of soil, which may contain toxoplasma, a parasite that can cause toxoplasmosis \u2013 which can harm your unborn baby. Wash all surfaces and utensils, and your hands, after preparing raw meat \u2013 this will help to avoid toxoplasmosis.   Make sure that raw foods are stored separately from ready-to-eat foods, otherwise there's a risk of contamination. This is to avoid other types of food poisoning from meat (such as salmonella, campylobacter and E.coli). Use a separate chopping board for raw meats. Heat ready meals until they're steaming hot all the way through \u2013 this is especially important for meals containing poultry. You also need to make sure that some foods, such as eggs, poultry, burgers, sausages and whole cuts of meat like lamb, beef and pork are cooked very thoroughly. For tips, read Foods to avoid in pregnancy. Healthy Start vouchers for pregnant women The Healthy Start scheme provides vouchers to pregnant women and families who qualify.

Action on Hearing Loss estimates that there are more than 10 million (about 1 in 6) people in the UK with some degree of hearing impairment or deafness.

General signs of hearing loss can include: difficulty hearing other people clearly and misunderstanding what they say asking people to repeat themselves listening to music or watching television with the volume turned up higher than other people require Read more about the symptoms of hearing loss. When to see your GP See your GP if you're having problems with your hearing, or your child is showing signs of hearing difficulty. If you lose your hearing suddenly, in one or both ears, you must see your GP as soon as possible. Your GP can check for any problems and may refer you to an audiologist (hearing specialist) or an ENT surgeon for further tests. You can also visit the Action on Hearing Loss website for an online hearing test. Read more about diagnosing hearing loss. Why it happens Hearing loss is the result of sound signals not reaching the brain. There are two main types of hearing loss, depending on where the problem lies: sensorineural hearing loss \u2013 caused by damage to the sensitive hair cells inside the inner ear or damage to the auditory nerve; this occurs naturally with age or as a result of injury conductive hearing loss \u2013 when sounds are unable to pass from your outer ear to your inner ear, often because of a blockage such as earwax, glue ear or a build-up of fluid from an ear infection, or because of a perforated ear drum or disorder of the hearing bones It's also possible to have both these types of hearing loss. This is known as mixed hearing loss. Some people are born with hearing loss, but most cases develop as you get older.  Read more about causes of hearing loss. Preventing hearing loss It isn't always possible to prevent hearing loss if you have an underlying condition that causes you to lose your hearing. However, there are several things you can do to reduce the risk of hearing loss from long-term exposure to loud noise. This includes not having music or the television on at a loud volume at home and using ear protection at loud music events or in noisy work environments. You should also see your GP if you have signs of an ear infection, such as flu-like symptoms, severe earache, discharge or hearing loss. Read more about preventing hearing loss. Treating hearing loss The way hearing loss is treated depends on the cause and how severe it is. In cases of sensorineural hearing loss, there are several options that may help to improve a person\u2019s ability to hear and communicate. These include: digital hearing aids \u2013 which are available through the NHS bone anchored implants \u2013 suitable for people who are unable to use hearing aids and for some levels of sensorineural hearing loss middle ear implants \u2013 suitable for some people who are unable to use hearing aids cochlear implants \u2013 for people who find hearing aids aren't powerful enough lip reading and\/or sign language \u2013 such as British Sign Language (BSL) Conductive hearing loss is sometimes temporary and can be treated with medication or minor surgery, if necessary. However, more major surgery may be required to fix the ear drum or hearing bones. If conventional hearing aids don't work, there are also some implantable devices for this type of hearing loss, such as a Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHAs). Read more about treating hearing loss. How hearing works Sound waves enter your ear and cause your eardrum to vibrate. These vibrations are passed to the three small bones (ossicles) inside your middle ear. The ossicles amplify the vibrations and pass them on to your inner ear where tiny hair cells inside the cochlea (the coiled, spiral tube inside the inner ear) move in response to the vibrations and send a signal through a nerve called the auditory nerve to the brain.

Why are hearing tests needed? Hearing tests are carried out for two main reasons: as a routine part of a baby\u2019s or young child\u2019s developmental checks to check the hearing of someone who is experiencing hearing problems or has hearing loss It's important hearing tests are carried out so the right support and treatment can be provided. Hearing tests are carried out at regular intervals during childhood, starting with the Newborn Hearing Screening Programme (NHSP) within a few weeks of birth. Your child's hearing may also be checked during a general health review when they are a few years old and before they start school for the first time. If you're worried about any hearing problems, you can ask your GP for a hearing test. Read more about when hearing tests are needed. What happens during a hearing test? Although your GP or practice nurse can examine your ears, you will usually be referred to a specialist for a hearing test. A number of different tests are used to check how well the ears are functioning and their ability to detect different levels of sound. Common hearing tests include: automated otoacoustic emissions (AOAE) tests \u2013 a computer attached to an earpiece plays clicking noises and measures the response from the ear automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) tests \u2013 sensors are placed on the head and neck to check the response of the nerves to sound played through headphones pure tone audiometry tests \u2013 sounds of different volumes and frequencies are played, usually through headphones, and a button is pressed when they are heard bone conduction tests \u2013 a vibrating noise generator sensor is placed behind the ear and presses on the bone to test how well the hearing nerve is working Generally, different tests are used for adults and children but they are all completely painless. The results of some of these tests are recorded on a graph called an audiogram, so that the type of hearing loss can be identified. Read more about: how hearing tests are carried out hearing tests for children  Hearing problems The ear is made up of three main areas: the outer ear \u2013 sound enters the outer ear and passes down the ear canal to the eardrum (a thin membrane), which vibrates the middle ear \u2013 this air-filled cavity contains three tiny bones that pick up and carry the vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear the inner ear \u2013 this contains the vestibular system (the balance organ) and the cochlea (the hearing organ), which is a coiled fluid-filled tube that turns the vibrations into electrical signals that are fed along the auditory nerve to the brain A problem in any of these areas will require a hearing test to determine the type of hearing loss you have. Conductive hearing loss Your hearing may be affected if sounds don't reach the inner ear efficiently. This is known as conductive hearing loss. Conductive hearing loss can be caused by problems such as: a blockage in your ear canal, such as a build-up of earwax a blockage in the middle ear \u2013 for example, glue ear an infection of your outer ear (otitis externa) or middle ear (otitis media) a hole or tear in the eardrum (perforated eardrum) otosclerosis, which is an abnormal growth of bone in the middle ear disruption of your hearing bones caused by injury or disease Conductive hearing loss caused by these problems is often temporary and reversible. Sensori-neural hearing loss If sounds reach the inner ear but are still not heard, the fault lies in the inner ear or (rarely) in the hearing nerve. This is called sensori-neural hearing loss. Sensori-neural hearing loss may occur for a number of reasons, most commonly as a result of age-related change. This sort of hearing loss is nearly always permanent.

This means parents can get the support and advice they need right from the start. One to two babies in every 1,000 are born with permanent hearing loss in one or both ears. This increases to about 1 in every 100 babies who have spent more than 48 hours in intensive care. Most of these babies are born into families with no history of permanent hearing loss. Permanent hearing loss can significantly affect a baby's development. Finding out early can give these babies a better chance of developing language, speech, and communication skills. It will also help babies make the most of relationships with their family or carers from an early age. When is the newborn hearing test done? If you give birth in hospital, you may be offered a newborn hearing test for your baby before you are discharged. In some areas it will be done by a health professional, healthcare assistant or health visitor within the first few weeks. You will be contacted by your local newborn hearing screening service to arrange a suitable time and venue. Ideally, the test is done in the first four to five weeks, but it can be done at up to three months of age. If you are not offered a screening test, ask your health visitor, local audiology department or GP to arrange an appointment, or contact your local newborn hearing screening service. How is the newborn hearing test done? The test is called the automated otoacoustic emission (AOAE) test. It takes just a few minutes. A small soft-tipped earpiece is placed in your baby's ear and gentle clicking sounds are played. When an ear receives sound, the inner part (called the cochlea) responds. This can be picked up by the screening equipment. It's not always possible to get clear responses from the first test. This happens with a lot of babies, and does not always mean your baby has a permanent hearing loss. It could mean: your baby was unsettled when the test was done there was background noise your baby has fluid or a temporary blockage in their ear In these cases your baby will be offered a second test. This may be the same as the first test, or another type called the automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) test. The AABR test involves placing three small sensors on your baby's head and neck. Soft headphones are placed over your baby's ears and gentle clicking sounds are played. This test takes between 5 and 15 minutes. These tests will not harm your baby in any way. Does my baby have to have the newborn hearing test? It's highly recommended, but you don't have to accept it. If you decide not to have the screening test, you will be given checklists to help you check on your baby's hearing as they grow older. If you have any concerns, you should speak to your health visitor or GP. When will we get the results? You will be given your baby's hearing test results as soon as the test is done. If your baby has a clear response in both ears, they are unlikely to have permanent hearing loss. However, the newborn hearing test doesn't pick up all types of permanent hearing loss. Children can also develop permanent hearing loss later on, so it's important to check your child's hearing as they grow up. The checklist in your baby's personal child health record (red book) tells you how to do this. You can also download two checklists: one that tells you what sounds your baby should make, and another that tells you what sort of sounds your baby should react to. If you have any concerns about your child's hearing, tell your health visitor or GP. What does it mean if my baby is referred to a hearing specialist? If the screening test results do not show a clear response from one or both of your baby's ears, an appointment will be made with a hearing specialist at an audiology clinic. Even if this happens, it doesn't necessarily mean your baby has a permanent hearing loss. A hearing specialist should see you within four weeks of your baby's hearing test. It's very important that you attend the appointment in case your baby does have permanent hearing loss. The appointment will usually take about one to two hours. This includes time to settle your baby. If possible, feed your baby shortly before the hearing test. Make sure you have the things you may need to keep them comfortable and happy. The tests will not hurt or be uncomfortable for your baby, and you will be able to stay with your baby while the tests are done. You may want to take your partner or a friend or relative with you to the appointment. The tests look similar to those used for your baby's screening tests, but give more detailed information about your baby's hearing. Your audiologist will usually be able to explain the results at the end of the appointment. They will explain what the results mean for your baby's hearing and whether any further tests are necessary. What does it mean if my baby has permanent hearing loss? Types and levels of permanent hearing loss vary. Each baby's hearing loss will be different. There is a range of support and information available, including leaflets on the different types of hearing loss: Your baby has a hearing loss Your baby has hearing loss in one ear Your baby has a mild hearing loss You can also contact the National Deaf Children's Society (NDCS) freephone helpline on 0808 800 8880 (voice and text).

Although serious hearing problems during childhood are rare, early testing ensures that any problems are picked up and managed as early as possible. This page covers: Why hearing tests are important When will my child's hearing be checked? Newborn hearing screening Hearing tests for older babies and children Causes of hearing problems in babies and children Spotting signs of a hearing problem Why hearing tests are important Hearing tests carried out soon after birth can help identify most babies with significant hearing loss, and testing later in childhood can pick up any problems that have been missed or have been slowly getting worse. Without routine hearing tests, there's a chance that a hearing problem could go undiagnosed for many months or even years. It's important to identify hearing problems as early as possible because they can affect your child's speech and language development, social skills and education. Treatment is more effective if any problems are detected and managed accordingly early on. An early diagnosis will also help ensure you and your child have access to any special support services you may need. When will my child's hearing be checked? Your child's hearing may be checked: Within a few weeks of birth \u2013 this is known as newborn hearing screening and it's often carried out before you leave hospital after giving birth. This is routine for all children and even those having a home birth will be invited to come to hospital to have this. At around eight months to one year old \u2013 a follow-up to the newborn hearing screen may be required at this time for some children. From eight months to two and a half years of age \u2013 you may be asked whether you have any concerns about your child's hearing as part of a review of your child's health and development, and hearing tests can be arranged if necessary. At around four or five years old \u2013 most children will have a hearing test when they start school, this may be conducted at school or an audiology department depending upon where you live. Your child's hearing can also be checked at any other time if you have any concerns. Speak to your GP or health visitor if you're worried about your child's hearing (see spotting hearing problems below). Newborn hearing screening Newborn babies can be screened for any potential hearing problems using two quick and painless tests. The tests are normally conducted on the ward before you leave hospital. They are the: automated otoacoustic emissions (AOAE) test \u2013 a soft earpiece is placed in your baby's ear and quiet clicking sounds are played through it; the earpiece picks up the response from the inner ear and a computer analyses the results automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) test \u2013 three small sensors are placed on your baby's head and neck, and soft headphones are used to play quiet clicking sounds; the sensors detect how your baby's brain and hearing nerves respond to the sound and a computer analyses the results Many babies will only need to have the AOAE test, but if it's not possible to get a clear result, or there is a possibility they have a problem with their hearing, they may need to have an AABR test as well. It's common for babies to have a second screening hearing test. This doesn't necessarily mean they have a hearing problem. It may be offered because your baby was unsettled during the first test, or they may just have a temporary blockage in their ear. If the results are inconclusive or concerns are raised during the screening process, a referral will be made for a more detailed assessment with your local audiology service. Read more about newborn hearing screening. Hearing tests for older babies and children A number of different hearing tests may be used to check for hearing problems in older babies and young children. These are usually undertaken at an audiology department. Some of the main tests carried out are described below. Visual reinforcement audiometry Visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) is usually used to test hearing in children from approximately seven months of age up to two-and-a-half years old. During the test, your child will sit on your lap or a chair while sounds are presented. Your baby will be taught to link the sound to a visual reward such as a toy or computer screen lighting up. Once your child is able to associate the sound and the visual reward the volume and pitch of the sound will be varied to determine the quietest sounds your child is able to hear. Play audiometry Young children between two and five years old may have a play audiometry test. During the test, sounds will be played through headphones or speakers and your child will be asked to perform a simple task when they hear the sound. This may vary from putting a ball in a bucket to completing a puzzle. As with VRA, the volume and pitch of the sound will be varied to determine the quietest sounds your child is able to hear. Pure tone audiometry Older children may have a test called pure tone audiometry. This is the test often used to screen a child's hearing before they start school, when it is sometimes referred to as the \"sweep test\". It's similar to a hearing test an adult might have. During pure tone audiometry, a machine generates sounds at different volumes and frequencies. The sounds are played through headphones and your child is asked to respond when they hear them by pressing a button. By changing the level of the sound, the tester can work out the quietest sounds your child can hear. Bone conduction test In addition to using speakers or headphones, most of the tests above can also be carried out using a small vibrating device placed behind the ear. This device passes sound directly to the inner ear through the bones in the head, which can help identify which part of the ear isn't working properly if your child is having hearing problems. Speech perception test Speech perception tests assess your child's ability to recognise words. This can be performed in a variety of ways depending on your child's age and ability. Some may be performed using voice and others may involve playing speech through headphones or a speaker. The child may need to identify words they hear by pointing at a toy, picture, or repeating what they hear. Tympanometry Tympanometry is a test to assess how flexible the eardrum is. For good hearing, your eardrum needs to be flexible to allow sound to pass through it. If the eardrum is too rigid \u2013 for example, because there is fluid behind it (glue ear) \u2013 sounds will bounce back off the eardrum instead of passing through it. During the test, a soft rubber tube will be placed at the entrance of your child's ear. Air is gently blown down the tube and a sound is played through a small speaker inside it. The tube then measures the sound that's bounced back from the ear. Causes of hearing problems in babies and children There are a number of reasons why a child may have a hearing problem, including temporary hearing loss from a common illness such as a cold. Some possible causes of hearing loss that may be detected during routine tests include: glue ear \u2013 a build-up of fluid in the middle ear, which is common in young children infections that develop in the womb or at birth, such as rubella or cytomegalovirus, which can cause progressive hearing loss inherited conditions, such as otosclerosis, which stop the ears or nerves from working properly damage to the cochlear or auditory nerves (which transmit hearing signals to the brain); this could be caused by a severe head injury, exposure to loud noise or head surgery, for example being starved of oxygen at birth (birth asphyxia) illnesses such as meningitis and encephalitis (which both involve swelling in the brain) Spotting signs of a hearing problem Although your child will be offered routine hearing tests as they grow up, it's still important for you to look out for signs of any problems and seek advice if you have any concerns. For babies, the checklist in your baby's personal child health record (red book) can be used to help you check your child's hearing as they grow up. You can also download two checklists produced by the NHS Newborn Hearing Screening Programme: one that tells you what sounds your baby should make (PDF, 28kb) and one that tells you what sort of sounds your baby should react to (PDF, 28kb). In older children, signs of a possible hearing problem can include: inattentiveness or poor concentration not responding when their name is called talking loudly and listening to the television at a high volume difficulty pinpointing where a sound is coming from mispronouncing words a change in their progress at school Speak to your GP or health visitor if you're concerned about your child's hearing. Your child can have a hearing test at any age. Page last reviewed: 29\/06\/2015 Next review due: 29\/06\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

These are to make sure they stay healthy and are developing normally. The reviews will usually be done by your health visitor or a member of the health visiting team. The team works closely with your GP and the staff at your local children's centre. Reviews may be done in your home or at the GP surgery, well baby clinic, or children's centre. Appointments can be arranged so both you and your partner are there. The reviews are an opportunity for you both to ask questions and discuss any concerns you may have. The personal child health record (red book) Shortly before or after your baby is born, you'll be given a personal child health record (PCHR). This usually has a red cover and is often called the \"red book\". It's a handy way for you to keep track of your child's health and progress, and can be shared with their health professionals. It's a good idea to take your baby's red book with you every time you visit the baby clinic, GP, or hospital. Your baby's health professionals will use it to record your child's weight and height, vaccinations, and other important health information. Find out more about your baby's vaccinations. You can also add information to the red book yourself. You may want to record any illnesses or accidents your baby has, and details of any medicines they take. You'll find it helpful to keep the developmental milestones section of the red book up-to-date and fill in the relevant questionnaires before each routine review. An electronic version of the red book is available in some areas. Find out more about the eRedbook. What happens at your baby's reviews During your baby's reviews, your health visitor will discuss your baby's progress and ask if you have any concerns. If your baby was born prematurely, their developmental age will be calculated from your original due date, not from the actual date they were born, until they are two years old. Your baby will be weighed regularly, but health professionals will want to avoid weighing them too often. This is because babies' weight gain can vary from week to week. Leaving a few weeks between weigh-ins gives a clearer idea of their progress. See how often your baby will be weighed. When your baby will have their reviews Your baby will usually have reviews at the ages outlined below. If you have any concerns at other times, contact your health visitor or GP, or go to your local baby clinic. Shortly after birth Your baby will be weighed at birth and again during their first week. They will also have a thorough physical examination within 72 hours of being born. A medical professional will usually check your baby's eyes, heart, hips, and \u2013 for baby boys \u2013 testes. Read more about the newborn physical examination. At five to eight days, but ideally at five days, your baby will have a blood spot (heel prick) test, which screens for a number of rare diseases, including cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. This is usually done by the midwife. See more about the blood spot (heel prick) test. Your baby will have a hearing test soon after birth. If you have your baby in hospital, this may be done before you leave. Otherwise, it will be done some time in the first few weeks at the hearing centre in your local hospital. See what the newborn hearing test involves. Your midwife and health visitor will also support you with breastfeeding, caring for your new baby, and adjusting to life as new parents. One to two weeks Your health visitor will carry out a new baby review with you and your partner within 10 to 14 days of the birth. They'll work with you on becoming parents and how to keep your baby safe and healthy. You and your partner will also be offered support with breastfeeding if you need it. Six to eight weeks Your baby will be invited for a thorough physical examination. This is usually done by your GP. Your baby's eyes, heart, hips, and \u2013 for boys \u2013 testicles will be checked. They will also have their weight, length, and head circumference measured. Your GP or health visitor will also discuss your baby's vaccinations with you. In the first year these are offered from 8, 12, and 16 weeks. The health visitor will also talk to you about your emotional wellbeing since the birth of your baby. See more information about the NHS vaccination schedule. Nine months to one year During this time, your baby should be offered another review looking at several areas, including language and learning, safety, diet, and behaviour. This is usually done by the health visitor or a member of the health visiting team, and is an opportunity for you and your partner to discuss any concerns you may have. You may be asked to fill in a short questionnaire to help your health visitor understand how your baby is developing. One to three years At one year of age your baby will have their next set of routine vaccinations. Between the ages of two and six, including school years 1 and 2, they will also be offered annual flu vaccinations, which are given as a nasal spray. At two to two-and-a-half years they will have another health and development review. This is usually done by a nursery nurse or the health visitor, and may happen at your home, baby clinic, the children's centre, or your child's nursery if they're attending one. They'll encourage you to talk about your child's progress and will help you with any concerns. You may be asked to fill in a short questionnaire about your baby's development. It's best if both you and your partner are there. If your child attends an early years setting, such as a nursery or childminder, the review may be linked to your child's early years progress check at age two. The review will cover: general development, including movement, speech, social skills and behaviour, and hearing and vision growth, healthy eating, and keeping active managing behaviour and encouraging good sleeping habits tooth brushing and going to the dentist  keeping your child safe vaccinations Three years onwards Your child will have another vaccination \u2013 sometimes called the preschool booster \u2013 at the age of three years, four months. They will also have annual flu vaccinations up to the age of six. Once your child reaches school age, the school nursing team and school staff will help support their health and development. They will work with you to make sure your child is offered the right vaccinations and health reviews. The school nursing team can also give you advice and support on all aspects of your child's health and wellbeing, including emotional and social issues.

The term \"congenital\" means the condition is present at birth. Congenital heart disease is one of the most common types of birth defect, affecting up to 9 in every 1,000 babies born in the UK. Why it happens In most cases, no obvious cause of congenital heart disease is identified. However, some things are known to increase the risk of the condition, including: Down's syndrome \u2013 a genetic disorder that affects a baby's normal physical development and causes learning difficulties the mother having certain infections, such as rubella, during pregnancy the mother having poorly controlled type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes other chromosome defects, where genes may be altered from normal and can be inherited  Read more about the causes of congenital heart disease and preventing congenital heart disease. Many cases of congenital heart disease are diagnosed before a baby is born during an ultrasound scan in pregnancy. However, it's not always possible to detect congenital heart defects in this way. Signs and symptoms Congenital heart disease can have a number of symptoms, including: rapid heartbeat rapid breathing excessive sweating extreme tiredness and fatigue a blue tinge to the skin (cyanosis) tiredness and rapid breathing when a baby is feeding  These problems are sometimes noticeable soon after birth, although mild defects may not cause any problems until later in life. Read more about the symptoms of congenital heart disease and diagnosing congenital heart disease. Types of congenital heart disease There are many types of congenital heart disease and they sometimes occur in combination. Some of the more common defects include: septal defects \u2013 where there's a hole between two of the heart's chambers (commonly referred to as a \"hole in the heart\") coarctation of the aorta \u2013 where the main large artery of the body, called the aorta, is narrower than normal pulmonary valve stenosis \u2013 where the pulmonary valve, which controls the flow of blood out of the lower right chamber of the heart to the lungs, is narrower than normal transposition of the great arteries \u2013 where the pulmonary and aortic valves and the arteries they're connected to have swapped positions Read more about the types of congenital heart disease. Treating congenital heart disease Treatment for congenital heart disease usually depends on the defect you or your child has. Mild defects, such as holes in the heart, often don't need to be treated, as they may improve on their own and may not cause any further problems. Surgery or interventional procedures are usually required if the defect is significant and causing problems. Modern surgical techniques can often restore most or all of the heart's normal function, and nowadays about 80% of children with congenital heart disease will survive into adulthood. However, people with congenital heart disease often need treatment throughout their life and therefore require specialist review during childhood and adulthood. This is because people with complex heart problems can develop further problems with their heart rhythm or valves over time. Most surgery and interventional procedures aren't considered to be a cure. The affected person's ability to exercise may be limited, which can progress over time and may lead to the need for further surgery or intervention. Some people with more complex congenital heart disease may not have a normal life span. It's important that a person with heart disease and their parents or carers discuss these issues with their specialist medical team. Read more about treating congenital heart disease and the complications of congenital heart disease. Information about your child If your child has congenital heart disease, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. The heart The heart is divided into four main sections called chambers. These are known as the: left atrium (collects blood returning from the lungs) left ventricle (the main pumping chamber for the body) right atrium (collects blood returning from the body's veins) right ventricle (pumps bloods to the lungs)  There are also four valves controlling how the blood flows through the heart and around the body. These are known as the: mitral valve (separating the left atrium from the left ventricle) aortic valve (separating the left ventricle from the main artery, the aorta) tricuspid valve (separating the right atrium from the right ventricle) pulmonary valve (separating the right ventricle from the pulmonary artery to the lung) Congenital heart disease can occur if any of these chambers or valves doesn't develop properly while a baby is in the womb.

It usually happens because the arteries supplying the heart become hardened and narrowed. The pain and discomfort of angina feels like a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest that can sometimes spread to the left arm, neck, jaw or back. The pain is usually triggered by physical activity or stress and typically only lasts for a few minutes. This is often referred to as an angina attack. Read more about the symptoms of angina. When to seek medical help Dial 999 to request an ambulance if you experience chest pain and you haven't previously been diagnosed with a heart problem. If you have an angina attack and you've previously been diagnosed with the condition, take the medication prescribed for you (glyceryl trinitrate). A second dose can be taken after five minutes if the first dose doesn't have any effect. If there's no improvement five minutes after the second dose, call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Types of angina The two main types of angina are stable angina and unstable angina. stable angina \u2013 where angina attacks are brought on by an obvious trigger (such as exercise) and improve with medication and rest unstable angina \u2013 where angina attacks are more unpredictable, occurring with no obvious trigger and continuing despite resting Stable angina isn't life-threatening on its own. However, it's a serious warning sign that you're at increased risk of developing a life-threatening heart attack or stroke. Some people develop unstable angina after previously having stable angina, while others experience unstable angina with no history of having angina before. Unstable angina should be regarded as a medical emergency, because it's a sign that the function of your heart has suddenly and rapidly deteriorated, increasing your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. Read more about diagnosing angina. Why angina happens Most cases of angina are caused by atherosclerosis, which is the hardening and narrowing of arteries as a result of a build-up of fatty substances known as plaques. This can restrict the blood supply to the heart and trigger the symptoms of angina. Advanced age, smoking, obesity and eating a diet high in saturated fats all increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis. Read more about the causes of angina. Treating angina Treatment for angina aims to relieve the symptoms during an angina attack, reduce the number of angina attacks that a person has, and reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke happening. A number of medications can be used to try to achieve this. Some of these are only taken when needed, while others are taken every day. Surgery to widen or bypass the narrowed arteries may be recommended if the symptoms don't respond to medication. Read more about treating angina. Complications A major concern for people with angina is that their atherosclerosis will continue to get worse. This can lead to the blood supply to their heart becoming blocked, which could trigger a heart attack. Similarly, a blockage of the blood supply to the brain could trigger a stroke. Each year it's estimated that 1 in every 100 people with stable angina will have a fatal heart attack or stroke, and as many as 1 in 40 people will have a non-fatal heart attack or stroke. You can considerably reduce your risk of developing these complications by making lifestyle changes. For example, if you're obese and you smoke, you can significantly reduce your risk by stopping smoking and maintaining a healthy weight. Read more about the complications of angina and preventing angina. Who's affected by angina Angina is a common condition among older adults. In England, it's estimated that 1 in every 12 men and 1 in every 30 women between 55 and 64 years of age have angina.

The term 'angioplasty' means using a balloon to stretch open a narrowed or blocked artery. However, most modern angioplasty procedures also involve inserting a short wire-mesh tube, called a stent, into the artery during the procedure. The stent is left in place permanently to allow blood to flow more freely. Coronary angioplasty is sometimes known as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The combination of coronary angioplasty with stenting is usually referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). When a coronary angioplasty is used Like all organs in the body, the heart needs a constant supply of blood. This is supplied by the coronary arteries. In older people, these arteries can become narrowed and hardened (known as atherosclerosis), which can cause coronary heart disease. If the flow of blood to the heart becomes restricted, it can lead to chest pain known as angina, which is usually triggered by physical activity or stress. While angina can often be treated with medication, a coronary angioplasty may be required to restore the blood supply to the heart in severe cases where medication is ineffective. Coronary angioplasties are also often used as an emergency treatment after a heart attack. What are the benefits of a coronary angioplasty? In most cases, the blood flow through the coronary arteries improves after an angioplasty. Many people find their symptoms get significantly better and they\u2019re able to do more than they could before the procedure. If you've had a heart attack, an angioplasty can increase your chances of surviving more than clot-busting medication (thrombolysis). The procedure can also reduce your chances of having another heart attack in the future. How a coronary angioplasty is performed A coronary angioplasty is performed using local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake while the procedure is carried out. A thin flexible tube called a catheter will be inserted into one of your arteries through an incision in your groin, wrist or arm. This is guided to the affected coronary artery using an X-ray video. When the catheter is in place, a thin wire is guided down the length of the affected coronary artery, delivering a small balloon to the affected section of artery. This is then inflated to widen the artery, squashing fatty deposits against the artery wall so blood can flow through it more freely when the deflated balloon is removed. If a stent is being used, this will be around the balloon before it's inserted. The stent will expand when the balloon is inflated and remains in place when the balloon is deflated and removed. A coronary angioplasty usually takes between 30 minutes and two hours. If you're being treated for angina, you'll normally be able to go home later the same day or the day after you have the procedure. You'll need to avoid heavy lifting, strenuous activities and driving for at least a week. If you've been admitted to hospital following a heart attack, you may need to stay in hospital for several days after the angioplasty procedure before going home. Read more about:  what happens during a coronary angioplasty  recovering from a coronary angioplasty How safe is a coronary angioplasty? A coronary angioplasty is one of the most common types of treatment for the heart. Around 75,000 procedures are performed in England each year. Coronary angioplasties are most commonly performed in people aged 65 or older, as they're more likely to have heart disease. As the procedure doesn't involve making major incisions in the body, it's usually carried out safely in most people. Doctors refer to this as a minimally invasive form of treatment. The risk of serious complications from a coronary angioplasty is generally small, but this depends on factors such as: your age your general health whether you've had a heart attack Serious problems that can occur as a result of the procedure include excessive bleeding, a heart attack and a stroke. Read more about the possible complications of a coronary angioplasty. Are there any alternatives? If many coronary arteries have become blocked and narrowed, or the structure of your arteries is abnormal, a coronary artery bypass graft may be considered. This is a type of invasive surgery where sections of healthy blood vessel are taken from other parts of the body and attached to the coronary arteries. Blood is diverted through these vessels, so it bypasses the narrowed or clogged parts of the arteries.

It's responsible for more than 73,000 deaths in the UK each year. About 1 in 6 men and 1 in 10 women die from CHD. In the UK, there are an estimated 2.3 million people living with CHD and around 2 million people affected by angina (the most common symptom of coronary heart disease).  CHD generally affects more men than women, although from the age of 50 the chances of developing the condition are similar for both sexes. As well as angina (chest pain), the main symptoms of CHD are heart attacks and heart failure. However, not everyone has the same symptoms and some people may not have any before CHD is diagnosed. CHD is sometimes called ischaemic heart disease. Read more about the symptoms of coronary heart disease. The heart The heart is a muscle about the size of your fist. It pumps blood around your body and beats approximately 70 times a minute. After the blood leaves the right side of the heart, it goes to your lungs where it picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood returns to your heart and is then pumped to the body's organs through a network of arteries. The blood returns to your heart through veins before being pumped back to your lungs again. This process is called circulation. The heart gets its own supply of blood from a network of blood vessels on the heart's surface called coronary arteries. What causes coronary heart disease? Coronary heart disease is the term that describes what happens when your heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries. Over time, the walls of your arteries can become furred up with fatty deposits. This process is known as atherosclerosis and the fatty deposits are called atheroma. Atherosclerosis can be caused by lifestyle factors and other conditions, such as: smoking high cholesterol high blood pressure (hypertension) diabetes Read more about the causes of coronary heart disease. Diagnosing coronary heart disease If your doctor feels you're at risk of CHD, they may carry out a risk assessment. This involves asking about your medical and family history, your lifestyle and taking a blood test. Further tests may be needed to confirm a diagnosis of CHD, including: an MRI scan a CT scan coronary angiography Read more about diagnosing coronary heart disease. Treating coronary heart disease Coronary heart disease can't be cured but treatment can help manage the symptoms and reduce the chances of problems such as heart attacks. Treatment can include lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and stopping smoking, as well as medication and surgery. Read more about treating coronary heart disease. Recovery If you have problems, such as a heart attack or heart surgery, it's possible to eventually resume a normal life. Advice and support is available to help you deal with aspects of your life that may have been affected by CHD. Read more about recovering from the effects of coronary heart disease. Prevention You can reduce your risk of getting CHD by making some simple lifestyle changes. These include: eating a healthy, balanced diet  being physically active giving up smoking controlling blood cholesterol and sugar levels Keeping your heart healthy will also have other health benefits, such as helping reduce your risk of stroke and dementia.

Lack of blood to the heart can seriously damage the heart muscle. A heart attack is known medically as a myocardial infarction or MI. Symptoms can include: chest pain \u2013 the chest can feel like it is being pressed or squeezed by a heavy object, and pain can radiate from the chest to the jaw, neck, arms and back shortness of breath feeling weak and\/or lightheaded overwhelming feeling of anxiety It is important to stress that not everyone experiences severe chest pain; the pain can often be mild and mistaken for indigestion. It is the combination of symptoms that is important in determining whether a person is having a heart attack, and not the severity of chest pain. Read more about the symptoms of a heart attack. Treating heart attacks A heart attack is a medical emergency. Dial 999 and ask for an ambulance if you think you or someone you know is having a heart attack. If the casualty is not allergic to aspirin and it\u2019s easily available, give them a tablet (ideally 300mg) to slowly chew and then swallow while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. The aspirin will help to thin the blood and reduce the risk of a heart attack. Treatment for a heart attack will depend on how serious it is. Two main treatments are: using medication to dissolve blood clots surgery to help restore blood to the heart Read more about treating heart attacks. What causes a heart attack? Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart attacks. CHD is a condition in which coronary arteries (the major blood vessels that supply blood to the heart) get clogged up with deposits of cholesterol. These deposits are called plaques. Before a heart attack, one of the plaques ruptures (bursts), causing a blood clot to develop at the site of the rupture. The clot may then block the supply of blood running through the coronary artery, triggering a heart attack. Your risk of developing CHD is increased by: smoking a high-fat diet diabetes high cholesterol high blood pressure being overweight or obese Read more about the causes of heart attacks. Recovery The time it takes to recover from a heart attack will depend on the amount of damage to the heart muscle. Some people are well enough to return to work after two weeks. Other people may take several months to recover. The recovery process aims to: reduce your risk of another heart attack through a combination of lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, and medications, such as statins (which help lower blood cholesterol levels) gradually restore your physical fitness so you can resume normal activities (known as cardiac rehabilitation) Most people can return to work after having a heart attack, but how quickly will depend on your health, the state of your heart and the type of work you do. Read more about recovering from a heart attack. Who is affected Heart attacks are one of the most common reasons why a person requires emergency medical treatment. Men are more likely to have a heart attack than women. The British Heart Foundation estimates that around 50,000 men and 32,000 women have a heart attack each year in England. Most heart attacks occur in people aged over 45. Complications Complications of heart attacks can be serious and possibly life-threatening. These include: arrhythmia \u2013 this is an abnormal heartbeat, where the heart begins beating faster and faster, then stops beating (cardiac arrest) cardiogenic shock \u2013 where the heart's muscles are severely damaged and can no longer contract properly to supply enough blood to maintain many body functions heart rupture \u2013 where the heart\u2019s muscles, walls or valves split apart (rupture) These complications can occur quickly after a heart attack and are a leading cause of death. Many people will die suddenly from a complication of a heart attack before reaching hospital. Read more about the complications of a heart attack. Outlook The outlook for people who have had a heart attack can be highly variable, depending on: their age \u2013 the older you are, the more likely you are to experience serious complications the severity of the heart attack \u2013 specifically, how much of the heart's muscle has been damaged during the attack how long it took before a person received treatment \u2013 the longer the delay, the worse the outlook tends to be In general, around one third of people who have a heart attack die as a result. These deaths often occur before a person reaches hospital or, alternatively, within the first 28 days after the heart attack. If a person survives for 28 days after having a heart attack, their outlook improves dramatically and most people will go on to live for many years.

It's a type of arrhythmia, which is a medical term used to describe problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. There are three levels of heart block (see below), and usually only the most serious type causes symptoms. This type of heart block is known as a complete, or third-degree, heart block.  Symptoms of heart block can include: shortness of breath  palpitations (irregular heartbeat) fainting How the heart beats When the heart beats normally, the heart muscle contracts (pulls inwards) ready to pump blood around the body. The contractions are triggered by electrical pulses generated by a group of specialised cells in the heart known as the sinoatrial node (SA node). The SA node, also known as the pacemaker, generates electrical pulses at regular intervals. The pulse is sent to another group of cells, called the atrioventricular node (AV node), which relays the pulse to the two lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles). A heart block occurs if the transmission of the pulse between the SA node, the AV node and the ventricles is interrupted. If you have a heart block, your heart won't stop beating altogether \u2013 other \u2018back-up\u2019 systems will take over. But it can cause an abnormally slow heartbeat (bradycardia), which deprives the body\u2019s organs and tissue of oxygen. Types of heart block There are three main types of heart block: first-degree heart block second-degree heart block third-degree heart block First-degree heart block In first-degree heart block, there's a split-second delay in the time it takes electrical pulses to move through the AV node. First-degree heart block rarely causes any noticeable symptoms. Second-degree heart block In second-degree heart block there's a series of increasing delays in the time it takes the AV node to send the pulse to the ventricle. This will eventually lead to a heartbeat being skipped. There are two sub-types of second-degree heart block that are known as: Mobitz type 1 \u2013 this is the less serious type. It occasionally causes mild dizziness and doesn't usually require treatment. It's also known as Wenckeback second-degree AV block. Mobitz type 2 \u2013 this is the more serious type. It can cause light-headedness, dizziness and fainting and usually requires treatment. Third-degree heart block In third-degree or complete heart block there's no transmission of electrical pulses between the atria and the ventricles through the AV node. A third-degree heart block causes a wide range of symptoms, some of which are life-threatening. This type of heart block can be a medical emergency, although in many cases it's mild and doesn't require treatment. All types of heart block can increase your risk of developing other types of arrythmia, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and abnormally fast heart rate). What causes heart block? Some people are born with heart block, either because of a congenital heart defect or a genetic condition. This is known as a congenital heart block. More commonly, heart block occurs later in life. It can be caused by: other heart conditions, such as a heart attack certain infections, such as diptheria certain medicines having open heart surgery Heart block that occurs later in life and is caused by factors such as these is known as acquired heart block. Read more about the causes of heart block. Diagnosing heart block Unless you're experiencing symptoms, heart block is often diagnosed during routine tests for other conditions. Babies are sometimes diagnosed with heart block during pregnancy. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is the main test that's used to diagnose heart block. It measures the electrical activity of your heart. During an ECG, small electrodes are placed on your chest and connected by wires to a monitor. The electrodes record a trace of your heart's rhythm and measure the strength and frequency of the elctrical signals. An ECG can be carried out at rest or while you're exercising, and provides a useful overall assessment of how well your heart is working. The results of an ECG can also sometimes indicate the type of heart block you have. Read more about diagnosing heart block. Treating heart block Heart block doesn't always need to be treated, unless the symptoms are serious. However, acquired heart block usually needs treatment. Transcutaneous pacing (TCP) is a temporary method of pacing the heart. Pads are applied to your chest and electrical pulses are passed through them to stabilise your heartbeat and restore your heart rate to normal. Once your heartbeat has been stabilised, a permanent pacemaker may be recommended. Pacemakers are small battery-operated devices that are inserted under the skin of your chest. It sends frequent electrical pulses to keep your heart beating regularly. Treatment for heart block usually works well if it's given when required. Deaths caused by heart block are rare. Read more about how heart block is treated. In heart block the electrical pulses that control the heartbeat are disrupted  Risk groups If a pregnant woman has an autoimmune condition, such as lupus, her unborn baby may develop congenital heart block. Congenital heart defects can also cause heart block. However, congenital third degree heart block is rare, occurring in one in every 20,000 births. Acquired heart block can affect people of all ages, but older people are more at risk because the risk factors are more common with age. For example, your risk of developing heart block is increased if you have a history of heart disease, heart attacks or heart failure. Elite athletes are at increased risk of developing first-degree heart block. This is because their hearts are often enlarged which can cause mild disruption to the heart's electrical signals. Taking certain medications, such as beta-blockers for treating high blood pressure, can also sometimes cause heart block.

It diverts blood around narrowed or clogged parts of the major arteries to improve blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart.  Around 20,000 coronary artery bypass grafts are carried out in England every year. Most of these are carried out in men, and around 80% are used to treat people who are at least 60 years of age. Why they're carried out Like all organs in the body, the heart needs a constant supply of blood. This is supplied by two large blood vessels called the left and right coronary arteries. Over time, these arteries can become narrowed and hardened by the build-up of fatty deposits called plaques. This process is known as atherosclerosis. People with atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries are said to have coronary heart disease. Your chances of developing coronary heart increase with age. You're also much more likely to be affected if: you smoke you're overweight or obese you have a high-fat diet Coronary heart disease can cause angina, which is chest pain that occurs when the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart becomes restricted. While many cases of angina can be treated with medication, severe angina may require a coronary artery bypass graft to improve the blood supply to the heart. Another risk associated with coronary heart disease is the possibility of one of the plaques in the coronary artery rupturing (splitting), creating a blood clot. If the blood clot blocks the blood supply to the heart, it can trigger a heart attack. Therefore, a coronary artery bypass graft may also be recommended to reduce your chances of having a heart attack. The procedure A coronary artery bypass graft involves taking a blood vessel from another part of the body \u2013 usually the chest, leg or arm \u2013 and attaching it to the coronary artery above and below the narrowed area or blockage. This new blood vessel is known as a graft. The number of grafts needed will depend on how severe your coronary heart disease is and how many of the coronary blood vessels are narrowed. A coronary artery bypass graft is carried out under general anaesthetic, which means you'll be unconscious during the operation. It usually takes between three and six hours. Read more about preparing for a coronary artery bypass graft and how a coronary artery bypass graft is performed. Recovery Most people will need to stay in hospital for at least seven days after having a coronary artery bypass graft. Recovering takes time and everyone recovers at slightly different speeds. Generally, you should be able to sit in a chair after one day, walk after three days and walk up and down stairs after five or six days. When you go home, you'll need to take things easy for a few weeks. You should be able to return to most of your normal activities after about six weeks, including working, driving, and having sex \u2013 most people make a full recovery within 12 weeks. Read more about recovering from a coronary artery bypass graft. Risks of surgery As with all types of surgery, a coronary artery bypass graft carries a risk of complications. These are usually relatively minor and treatable, such as an irregular heartbeat or a wound infection, but there's also a risk of serious complications such as a stroke or heart attack. Overall, more than 95% of people who have a coronary artery bypass graft will live for at least one year, and around 90% will live at least five years. Read more about the risks of a coronary artery bypass graft. After surgery After having a coronary artery bypass graft, most people will experience a significant improvement in symptoms such as breathlessness and chest pain, and their heart attack risk will be lowered. However, it's important to be aware that a coronary artery bypass graft isn't a cure for coronary heart disease. If you don't make lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, your grafted arteries will also eventually become hardened and narrowed. In some cases, a coronary artery bypass graft may need to be repeated or you may need a procedure to widen your arteries using a small balloon and a tube called a stent (coronary angioplasty). Read more about healthy living after a coronary artery bypass graft. Alternatives A coronary angioplasty is the main alternative to a coronary artery bypass graft. It's a less invasive operation where a long, flexible hollow plastic tube called a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in your arm or groin. A balloon attached to the catheter is then inflated to widen the artery and a small metal tube called a stent is often used to help keep the artery open. It usually takes less time to recover from a coronary angioplasty than from a coronary artery bypass graft, but there's a higher chance that the procedure will need to be repeated. Also, a coronary angioplasty may not be recommended if multiple coronary arteries have become blocked and narrowed or the structure of the blood vessels near your heart is abnormal. Read more about the alternatives to a coronary artery bypass graft. How long will I have to wait for surgery? The length of time you'll have to wait to have coronary artery bypass graft will vary from area to area. Your GP or cardiac surgeon should be able to tell you what the waiting lists are like in your area or at the hospital you've chosen. Ideally, you should be treated within three months of the decision to operate.

It usually occurs because the heart has become too weak or stiff. It's sometimes called \"congestive\" heart failure, although this name isn't widely used nowadays. Heart failure doesn't mean your heart has stopped working \u2013 it just needs some support to help it work better. It can occur at any age, but is most common in older people. Heart failure is a long-term condition that tends to get gradually worse over time. It can't usually be cured, but the symptoms can often be controlled for many years. This page covers: Symptoms When to get medical advice Causes Treatment Outlook Symptoms of heart failure The main symptoms of heart failure are: breathlessness after activity or at rest feeling tired most of the time and finding exercise exhausting swollen ankles and legs Some people also experience other symptoms, such as a persistent cough, a fast heart rate, and dizziness. Symptoms can develop quickly (acute heart failure) or gradually over weeks or months (chronic heart failure). Read more about the symptoms of heart failure. When to get medical advice See your GP if you experience persistent or gradually worsening symptoms of heart failure. Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible if you have sudden or very severe symptoms. A number of tests can be used to help check how well your heart is working, including blood tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an echocardiogram. Read more about how heart failure is diagnosed. Causes of heart failure Heart failure is often the result of a number of problems affecting the heart at the same time. Conditions that can lead to heart failure include: coronary heart disease \u2013 where the arteries that supply blood to the heart become clogged up with fatty substances (atherosclerosis), which may cause angina or a heart attack high blood pressure \u2013 this can put extra strain on the heart, which over time can lead to heart failure cardiomyopathy \u2013 conditions affecting the heart muscle heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) \u2013 such as atrial fibrillation damage or other problems with the heart valves congenital heart disease \u2013 birth defects that affect the normal workings of the heart Sometimes anaemia, excessive alcohol consumption, an overactive thyroid, or high pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) can also lead to heart failure. Treatments for heart failure Treatment for heart failure usually aims to control the symptoms for as long as possible and slow down the progression of the condition. Common treatments include: lifestyle changes \u2013 including eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly and stopping smoking medication \u2013 a range of medicines can help; many people need to take two or three different types devices implanted in your chest \u2013 these can help control your heart rhythm surgery \u2013 such as a bypass operation or a heart transplant Treatment will usually be needed for life. A cure may be possible when heart failure has a treatable cause. For example, if your heart valves are damaged, replacing or repairing them may cure the condition. Read more about how heart failure is treated and living with heart failure. Outlook for heart failure Heart failure is a serious long-term condition that will usually continue to get slowly worse over time. It can severely limit the activities you're able to do and is often eventually fatal. But it's very difficult to predict how the condition will progress on an individual basis. It's very unpredictable \u2013 many people remain stable for many years, while in some cases it may get worse quickly. Overall, around half of people with heart failure live at least five years after their diagnosis.

Your heart may feel like it's pounding, fluttering or beating irregularly, often for just a few seconds or minutes. You may also feel these sensations in your throat or neck. Palpitations may seem alarming, but in most cases they're harmless and are not a sign of a problem with your heart. Sometimes you may feel an extra or missed beat. These are known as 'ectopic beats', and are also usually nothing to worry about. However, palpitations accompanied by other symptoms, such as dizziness or tightness in your chest, can sometimes be a sign of a heart problem (see below). You should visit your GP if you have palpitations along with other symptoms or if you're concerned. What causes heart palpitations? Lifestyle triggers Palpitations may be triggered by a surge of adrenaline, a hormone your body releases after you have overexerted yourself or when you feel nervous, anxious or excited. Eating rich, spicy foods, drinking excessive amounts of caffeine or alcohol, smoking, and using recreational drugs can all bring on palpitations. If you think lifestyle factors are causing your palpitations, try to reduce your stress levels by using relaxation techniques and moderating the level of exercise you do. You should also reduce your intake of coffee or energy drinks and avoid using recreational drugs. Panic attacks If you have regular palpitations and also have feelings of anxiety, stress and panic, you may be experiencing panic attacks. A panic attack can cause an overwhelming sense of anxiety, fear and apprehension, accompanied by nausea, sweating, trembling and palpitations. Panic attacks can be frightening and intense, but aren't usually dangerous. Read more about panic attacks. Medication Less commonly, palpitations can be a side effect of some types of medicine, such as asthma inhalers or tablets for a thyroid problem. Speak to your GP if you think medication may be responsible for your palpitations. Don't stop taking a prescribed treatment without first consulting your GP. Periods, pregnancy and the menopause Palpitations can sometimes be the result of hormonal changes during a woman's periods, during pregnancy, or around the time of the menopause. However, these are usually only temporary and not a cause for concern. Medical conditions The following conditions can make the heart beat faster, stronger or irregularly, and can be a cause of heart palpitations: an overactive thyroid a low blood sugar level anaemia some types of low blood pressure  a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above  dehydration (not enough fluid in the body) a heart problem (see below) When you may have a heart problem If you start to experience palpitations more often, or if they get worse or occur with other symptoms such as dizziness or tightness in your chest, see your GP. You may have a heart rhythm problem (arrhythmia), such as atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). There are also other, less common, heart rhythm conditions that may be the cause of your palpitations. These can be determined by appropriate tests. When your GP or hospital discovers the exact problem with your heart, ask them to explain it to you. Seeing your GP Your GP will often carry out an electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess your heart rate and rhythm. This may immediately confirm whether there's a problem and whether treatment is needed. However, the results of an ECG will often be completely normal if you're not having palpitations at the time of the test. Further tests may be needed, which may be carried out by your GP or local hospital. Atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common heart rhythm problems and is a major cause of stroke (a serious medical condition that can cause permanent disability). In the UK, atrial fibrillation affects up to 800,000 people, and is most common in those over 55 years of age. It causes a fast, irregular pulse, which can cause a persistent heart flutter. You may also feel dizzy, short of breath and very tired. Atrial fibrillation is not usually life threatening, but can be uncomfortable and often needs treating. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a similar heart rhythm problem to atrial fibrillation. It also causes episodes of an abnormally fast heart rate, but the heart rate is often steady and not irregular. Episodes of SVT are usually harmless and tend to settle down on their own without the need for treatment. However, you should seek medical advice if you have prolonged episodes of SVT.

It may be recommended when a person's life is at risk because their heart no longer works effectively. This page covers: Why they're carried out What happens Recovery Risks Outlook Why heart transplants are carried out A heart transplant may be considered if you have severe heart failure and medical treatments aren't helping. Conditions that may eventually require a heart transplant include: coronary heart disease \u2013 a build-up of fatty substances in the arteries supplying the heart, which block or interrupt blood flow to the heart cardiomyopathy \u2013 where the walls of the heart have become stretched, thickened or stiff congenital heart disease \u2013 birth defects that affect the normal workings of the heart If your doctor thinks you might benefit from a heart transplant, you'll need to have an in-depth assessment to check whether you're healthy enough to have one before being placed on a waiting list. Read more about who can have a heart transplant and being on the heart transplant waiting list. What happens during a heart transplant A heart transplant needs to be carried out as soon as possible after a donor heart becomes available. The procedure is performed under general anaesthetic (where you're asleep). While it's carried out, a heart-lung bypass machine will be used to keep your blood circulating with oxygen-rich blood. A cut is made in the middle of the chest. Your own heart is then removed, and the donor heart is connected to the main arteries and veins. The new heart should then begin beating normally. Read more about how a heart transplant is performed. Recovering from a heart transplant You'll usually need to stay in hospital for around two or three weeks after a heart transplant. Most people are able to start returning to many of their normal activities within a few months. Your transplant team can give you advice about how long you may need to avoid certain activities during your recovery. You'll need to have regular check-ups with your transplant team after the transplant. You'll also need to take medications called immunosuppressants for the rest of your life. Without these medicines, your body may recognise your new heart as foreign and attack it (known as rejection). Read more about recovering from a heart transplant. Risks of a heart transplant A heart transplant is a complex and risky procedure. Possible complications include: the immune system recognising the transplanted heart as foreign and attacking it (rejection) the donated heart fails to work properly (graft failure) narrowing of the arteries supplying the heart (cardiac allograft vasculopathy) side effects from the immunosuppressant medication, such as an increased vulnerability to infections, weight gain and kidney problems Many of these problems are treatable, although sometimes another heart transplant may need to be carried out if possible. Read more about the risks associated with a heart transplant. Outlook for heart transplants Most people can eventually return to their normal activities after a heart transplant and experience a significant improvement in their symptoms for many years. However, it's a major operation and some of the complications can be life threatening. Overall: 80-90 in every 100 people will live at least a year 70-75 in every 100 people will live at least five years 50 in every 100 people will live at least 10 years Some people have survived for more than 25 years after a heart transplant.

On average, only six heart-lung transplants are performed in the UK each year. This is because there are very few suitable donor organs available and priority is generally given to people who only need a heart transplant. When is a heart-lung transplant needed? A heart-lung transplant is the only treatment available for people who have combined heart and lung failure when all other treatment options have failed. The conditions that most often require a heart-lung transplant are: congenital heart disease \u2013 birth defects of the heart that impact the lungs pulmonary hypertension \u2013 where high blood pressure develops inside the blood vessels of the lungs, which can damage both the lungs and the heart Occasionally, a heart-lung transplant may be used to treat cystic fibrosis, a condition where the lungs and digestive system become clogged up with sticky mucus. Who can have one? The total number of available donor hearts and lungs is very small and the transplant operation places a major strain on the body. This means a heart-lung transplant will only be recommended after very careful consideration and an in-depth assessment of your physical and mental health. A person is usually only considered to be a suitable candidate for a transplant if they are in relatively good health and have no other serious medical problems. For example, a heart-lung transplant may not be recommended if you are elderly, have cancer, misuse alcohol or drugs, smoke, are obese, or have a long-term mental health condition. Specific criteria for people requiring a heart-lung transplant are currently being developed. For now, recommendations are made after consultation with a panel of transplant experts and members of your transplant team. The heart-lung transplant process If it's thought you might benefit from a heart-lung transplant, you'll be asked to have an assessment in hospital to check whether you are a suitable candidate for the procedure. This will involve a number of tests, which may include blood tests, urine tests, blood pressure tests, lung and heart function tests, X-rays and scans. If a heart-lung transplant is recommended after your assessment, you'll go on the transplant list to wait until suitable donor organs become available. The length of time spent on the waiting list can vary, but it can be several months or even years. When a set of donor heart and lungs becomes available, you'll be admitted to hospital for the operation, which usually takes several hours to complete. Most people need to stay in hospital for around three weeks after the procedure. Read more about what happens before and during a heart-lung transplant and recovering from a heart-lung transplant. What are the risks? A heart-lung transplant is a major procedure that carries a high risk of complications, some of which can be fatal. This is why the procedure is usually only carried out when all other treatment options have been exhausted and it's thought the potential benefits will outweigh the risks. The main risk after a heart-lung transplant is your immune system recognising the donated organs as not belonging to you and attacking them, which can stop the organs working properly. This can often be avoided by taking medication to suppress your immune system. However, these medications themselves can cause side effects, such as high blood pressure and increased vulnerability to infections. Read more about the risks of having a heart-lung transplant. Results The outcomes of heart-lung transplants have improved significantly since the operation was first carried out in the early 1980s, mainly because of the introduction of immunosuppressant medication. In the UK, around 85% of people who have a heart-lung transplant are still alive after one year. For those who survive to one year, the outlook is generally quite good, with most people surviving for at least 10 years and some people potentially living for 25 years or more. However, it's important to realise that survival rates are a guide and cannot predict outcomes for each person. There are many factors that could influence your own predicted survival, such as your age. Your transplant team will be able to provide you with more detailed information. Help and support Finding out that you need to have a transplant, waiting for suitable donor organs to become available, and actually having the transplant can be emotionally demanding for both you and your family. Most transplant teams are able to offer counselling for this. Alternatively, your GP may be able to refer you to a counsellor and provide you with information and advice about joining a support group in your area. There are a number of support groups, charities and other organisations that offer support and advice. These include: British Heart Foundation \u2013 a charity for people affected by heart disease British Lung Foundation \u2013 a charity for people affected by lung disease  Children's Heart Foundation \u2013 a charity for people affected by congenital heart disease   Little Hearts Matter \u2013 a charity that supports children with serious heart defects NHS Organ Donor Register Because of the limited availability of suitable organs, there is a need for members of the public to join the NHS Organ Donor Register. You can join the Organ Donor Register by completing a simple online form or calling the NHS Donor Line on 0300 123 23 23.

During each heartbeat, the smaller upper chambers of the heart (atria) contract to push blood into the larger lower chambers (ventricles). The mitral valve opens to allow this passage of blood from the left atrium, and closes when the left ventricle is full of blood, to prevent backflow. When the valve closes, its two leaflets (flaps) normally seal the valve shut. Tendons attached to these flaps keep them taut and prevent them collapsing through to the other side. Problems affecting the mitral valve Problems with the mitral valve can make the heart less efficient at pumping blood around the body. Severe problems can lead to heart failure (where the heart can no longer pump enough blood around the body) if the valve is not surgically repaired or replaced. Common mitral valve problems are: mitral regurgitation (also called 'mitral incompetence') \u2013 where there is a backflow of blood through the valve, often as a result of a problem called mitral valve prolapse (where the valve collapses) mitral stenosis \u2013 where the valve doesn't open as wide as it should, restricting blood flow These conditions can occur alone or in combination. They are covered in more detail below. Mitral regurgitation Mitral regurgitation means there is a backflow of blood from the left ventricle to the left atrium when the heart contracts during a heartbeat. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, tiredness, dizziness and chest pain, and it can lead to atrial fibrillation (a condition that causes an irregular and often abnormally fast heart rate), pulmonary hypertension (high pressure inside the vessels carrying blood from the heart to the lungs) and heart failure. Mitral regurgitation can happen when the mitral valve flaps fail to seal shut, either because of problems with the flaps (such as a mitral valve prolapse \u2013 see below) or due to widening of the mitral annulus, which is the ring of muscle surrounding the valve. These problems are more common in older people and are often the result of changes to the heart with age. For example, the mitral valve may become weaker due to 'wear and tear' or damage caused by persistent high blood pressure. Occasionally, mitral regurgitation can occur as a result of rheumatic heart disease (a complication of rheumatic fever), cardiomyopathy (a disease of the heart muscle), endocarditis (infection of the inner lining of the heart), or congenital heart disease (birth defects affecting the normal workings of the heart). If regurgitation is only mild, you may just be monitored at regular intervals with echocardiography (an scan of the heart) to check your heart function. If you have moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, you'll probably need surgery to repair or replace the valve (see below). You may also need medications called nitrates or diuretics to reduce symptoms such as shortness of breath, and medication to treat atrial fibrillation. If you have severe mitral regurgitation and you are not suitable for surgery, or you are still having problems after surgery, you may be offered medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers to help manage the condition. Mitral valve prolapse Mitral valve prolapse means that one or more of the mitral flaps are floppy and don't close tightly, often leading to backflow of blood (mitral regurgitation \u2013 see above). Most people with a mitral valve prolapse will not have symptoms, unless the problem causes severe mitral regurgitation, and it is usually discovered by chance during echocardiography (an ultrasound scan of the heart) carried out for a different reason. Occasionally, however, mitral valve prolapse can cause problems such as arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat) and palpitations (sudden, noticeable heartbeats). Mitral valve prolapse can be caused by problems with the connective tissues (chords) that join the mitral valve to the heart muscles or, more rarely, by damage to the heart muscles themselves as the result of a heart attack. Some people with the condition are born with it and it's more common in people with connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome. If mitral valve prolapse isn't causing any symptoms and you are at low risk of developing severe mitral regurgitation, you won't need surgical treatment. Mild symptoms can sometimes be controlled with lifestyle changes, such as giving up cigarettes, caffeine and alcohol, because these can cause your heart to become overstimulated.  Surgical repair or replacement of the valve (see below) may be recommended if you have: severe mitral regurgitation causing symptoms no symptoms but an enlarged lower heart chamber severe mitral regurgitation with atrial fibrillation or pulmonary hypertension Mitral valve stenosis Mitral valve stenosis occurs when the mitral valve doesn't open as wide as it should, restricting the flow of blood through the heart. As a result, less blood can get to the body and the upper heart chamber swells as pressure builds up. Blood and fluid can also collect in the lungs, making it hard for you to breathe. The most common cause of mitral valve stenosis in adults is rheumatic fever, which can occur five to 10 years before the heart valve problems began. Rheumatic fever causes the valve to become inflamed (swollen), and over time the flaps of the inflamed valve stick together and become scarred, rigid and thickened. Rarer causes of mitral valve stenosis include calcium deposits forming around the valve, radiation treatment to the chest and some medications. Mitral valve stenosis may not cause any symptoms, but common warning signs include shortness of breath and an abnormally fast heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation). If you don't have any symptoms, your heart function may just be monitored at regular intervals with echocardiography (an ultrasound scan of the heart). Some people will be offered medications called nitrates or diuretics to reduce the build-up of fluid in the lungs, medication to treat atrial fibrillation and medication to prevent blood clots. If you have symptoms, you're at risk of heart failure if you do not have an operation either to open up the valve (percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty) or have it replaced. See below for more information about these procedures. Left untreated, moderate to severe mitral stenosis can lead to heart failure. Surgery for mitral valve problems  If you have a severe case of mitral regurgitation, mitral valve prolapse or mitral valve stenosis, you will usually need to have a heart valve operation. Most heart valve operations are performed under general anaesthetic (where you are asleep). They usually involve making a cut down the middle of the breastbone, although some surgeons are increasingly carrying out these operations using small incisions between the ribs (a 'minimal access' approach).  Sometimes it's possible to perform the surgery using a 'percutaneous' method, which involves feeding a catheter (thin, flexible tube) into a large vein in your neck or groin and guiding this through to your heart. People tend to recover more quickly from this procedure, but the results are often less predictable. The most common mitral valve procedures are: mitral valve repair surgery mitral valve replacement surgery percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty These procedures are briefly explained below, but your surgeon or heart specialist will explain any operation in detail to you, including the risks and benefits. It is also possible to carry out procedures similar to mitral valve repair using percutaneous techniques, but these are not covered in any detail here because they not widely used and there are still some uncertainties about them. For more information, you can read: NICE guidelines on percutaneous mitral valve repair for mitral regurgitation  NICE guidelines on percutaneous mitral valve annuloplasty  Mitral valve repair surgery  Repairing the mitral valve flaps is the main surgical treatment for mitral regurgitation.  The operation is carried out under general anaesthetic and your surgeon will usually gain access to your heart through an incision made along your chest. Some surgeons may also perform this type of operation using laparoscopic (\u2018keyhole\u2019) techniques, and the advantages of this approach are still being evaluated. The two flaps of the mitral valve are then partially clipped or sewn together to reduce the amount of blood leaking backwards by keeping the flaps close together during each heart contraction. This operation is generally successful, with only a small chance of major complications. Mitral valve replacement surgery Mitral valve replacement is usually only considered if you're unable to have the valve repaired. You will need it if your valve is furred up with calcium deposits or if the leaflets of your valve do not move. During surgery, your mitral valve is replaced with either a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve, which is made from animal tissue. This is major open heart surgery performed under general anaesthetic and usually involves making an incision along your chest. You'll be put on a heart-lung bypass machine during the operation, which takes over the function of your heart and lungs while the procedure is carried out. You will  usually need to take medication to prevent blood clots for a long period after this operation. This operation is generally successful, with a small chance of major complications, although the risk of serious and life-threatening problems is generally higher than with mitral valve repair surgery. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty Balloon valvuloplasty, also known as percutaneous mitral commissurotomy, is a non-surgical treatment option for mitral valve stenosis. It's usually performed by a cardiologist (heart specialist) using just a local anaesthetic (where you remain awake but your skin is numbed). A catheter is inserted through your skin via a large vein in your groin or neck and passed through to your heart. The tip of the catheter, which has a balloon attached, is positioned directly inside the narrowed valve. The balloon is inflated and deflated several times to widen the valve opening, before the balloon is deflated and removed. This procedure is most commonly used in young patients who do not have too much calcium deposited on their valve, pregnant women, and patients who are at an increased risk of developing complications from a mitral valve replacement (see above).

It usually occurs as a result of the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus becoming weakened. Read more about the causes of GORD. GORD causes symptoms such as heartburn and an unpleasant taste in the back of the mouth. It may just be an occasional nuisance for some people, but for others it can be a severe, lifelong problem. GORD can often be controlled with self-help measures and medication. Occasionally, surgery to correct the problem may be needed. This topic focuses on GORD in adults. There are separate topics on reflux in babies and heartburn in pregnancy. This page covers: Symptoms of GORD What to do if you have GORD When to see your GP Treatments for GORD Complications of GORD Symptoms of GORD Symptoms of GORD can include: heartburn (an uncomfortable burning sensation in the chest that often occurs after eating) acid reflux (where stomach acid comes back up into your mouth and causes an unpleasant, sour taste) oesophagitis (a sore, inflamed oesophagus) bad breath bloating and belching feeling or being sick pain when swallowing and\/or difficulty swallowing Read more about the symptoms of GORD.

They're available over the counter from pharmacies and are often used to treat the symptoms of heartburn and indigestion. How antacids work Antacids counteract (neutralise) the acid in your stomach that's used to aid digestion. This helps reduce the symptoms of heartburn and relieves pain. Some antacids also coat the surface of the oesophagus (gullet) with a protective barrier against stomach acid, or produce a gel on the stomach\u2019s surface which helps stop acid leaking into the oesophagus and causing acid reflux. Different types of antacids Antacids are available in liquid form or as chewable tablets. They're sold under various brand names but contain common ingredients, including: aluminium hydroxide magnesium carbonate magnesium trisilicate Extra ingredients are sometimes added to help treat other problems, such as simeticone to relieve flatulence (wind), and alginates to prevent acid flowing into your oesophagus. Who can't take antacids? Antacids aren't suitable for everyone. For example, many antacids aren't recommended for children under the age of 12 and people with certain health conditions, such as kidney disease. Antacids can also interfere with other medications, so you may not be able to take them while you're being treated for another condition. Antacids are generally considered safe to take during pregnancy, but you should discuss it with your GP or pharmacist beforehand. Read more about who can't take antacid medicines. Possible side effects of antacids Like all medicines, antacids can have side effects. Common side effects include: diarrhoea constipation flatulence stomach cramps feeling sick or vomiting If you have diarrhoea or constipation after taking antacids it may be possible to switch to an alternative medicine. Speak to your GP or pharmacist for advice. Any side effects you experience while taking antacids should pass once you stop taking the medication. Visit your GP if they continue. Missed or extra doses When taking antacid medicines, follow the instructions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine or the advice of your GP or pharmacist. If you miss a dose, it won't usually be necessary to alter your next dose. It's likely that you can carry on taking your normal dose. However, for specific advice about what to do, refer to the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. Taking extra doses could cause several unpleasant side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation. Contact your GP or pharmacist immediately if you think that you've taken more antacids than you should have. Alternatively, you can call NHS 111 for advice.

The symptoms usually come on after eating food. Heartburn is a strong, burning pain in the chest caused by stomach acid passing from your stomach into your oesophagus (the tube that leads from your mouth to your stomach).  You can help ease the discomfort of indigestion and heartburn by making changes to your diet and lifestyle, and there are treatments that are safe to take in pregnancy. Talk to your midwife, GP or pharmacist. You can also find out more by reading this page or clicking on the links to go directly to the relevant information. Symptoms of indigestion Causes of indigestion in pregnancy Treatment for indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy Self-help tips for indigestion and heartburn Symptoms of indigestion in pregnancy Symptoms of indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy are the same as for anyone else with the condition. The main symptom is pain or a feeling of discomfort in your chest or stomach. This usually happens soon after eating or drinking, but there can sometimes be a delay between eating a meal and developing indigestion. You may experience indigestion at any point during your pregnancy, although your symptoms may be more frequent and severe during later pregnancy, from 27 weeks onwards. As well as pain, indigestion may cause: heartburn, a burning sensation caused by acid passing from the stomach into the oesophagus feeling uncomfortable or heavy belching (burping) regurgitation (food coming back up from the stomach) bloating nausea (feeling sick) vomiting (being sick) Causes of indigestion in pregnancy The symptoms of indigestion (dyspepsia), including heartburn, are caused by stomach acid coming into contact with the sensitive protective lining (mucosa) of your digestive system. The stomach acid breaks down the mucosa, which causes irritation and leads to the symptoms of indigestion. When you're pregnant, you are more likely to have indigestion due to:  hormonal changes that your body is going through your growing womb (uterus) pressing on your stomach the relaxing of the lower oesophageal sphincter (ring of muscle) that acts like a gate between your stomach and your oesophagus, allowing stomach acid to leak back up You may be more likely to get indigestion in pregnancy if: you had indigestion before you were pregnant you have been pregnant before you are in the latter stages of pregnancy Your GP or midwife will usually be able to diagnose indigestion or heartburn from your symptoms and by asking you some questions. For example, they might ask:  how the symptoms are affecting your day-to-day life what your usual eating habits are if you have tried any treatments already if you experienced indigestion or any other stomach conditions before you were pregnant Your GP or midwife may also examine your chest and stomach. They may press gently on different areas of your chest and stomach to see whether this is painful. Treatments for indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy In some cases, changes to your diet and lifestyle may be enough to control indigestion, particularly if the symptoms are mild. If you have severe indigestion, or if changes to your diet and lifestyle don't work, your GP or midwife may suggest using medication to help ease your symptoms. Several indigestion medicines are safe to use during pregnancy. However, check with your GP, midwife or pharmacist before taking anything they have not recommended. The types of medicines that may be prescribed for indigestion and heartburn during pregnancy are: Antacids Antacids are a type of medicine that can provide immediate relief from indigestion. They work by neutralising the acid in your stomach (making it less acidic) so that it no longer irritates the protective lining (mucosa) of your digestive system. Alginates Some antacids are combined with another type of medicine known as an alginate. This helps relieve indigestion caused by acid reflux. Acid reflux occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your oesophagus and irritates its protective lining. Alginates work by forming a foam barrier that floats on the surface of your stomach contents. This keeps stomach acid in your stomach and away from your oesophagus. In most cases, antacids and alginates can effectively control the symptoms of indigestion during pregnancy. Choice and dosage A number of antacids are available over-the-counter from your pharmacist without a prescription. Ask your pharmacist for advice about which ones are suitable for you. You may only need to take antacids and alginates when you start to experience symptoms. In other cases, your GP may recommend that you take these medicines before your symptoms are expected, such as: before a meal before bed It is safe to use antacids and alginates while you are pregnant as long as you do not take more than the recommended dose. Follow the instructions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine to ensure that you take it correctly. Side effects from antacids are rare, but can include: diarrhoea  constipation  Iron supplements If you are prescribed an antacid medicine and you are also taking iron supplements, do not take them at the same time. Antacids can prevent iron from being properly absorbed by your body. Take your antacid at least two hours before or after your iron supplement. Acid-suppressing medicines If antacids and alginates do not improve your symptoms of indigestion, your GP may prescribe a different medicine that suppresses the acid in your stomach. There are two acid-suppressing medicines that are safe to use during pregnancy: ranitidine omeprazole As with antacids and alginates, follow the dosage instructions on the patient information leaflet or packet. Ranitidine Ranitidine is usually prescribed as tablets to be taken twice a day. Follow the dosage instructions, as your medicine may not work if you only take it when you have symptoms. Ranitidine rarely causes any side effects. Omeprazole Omeprazole is usually prescribed as a tablet to take once a day. After five days, your symptoms should have improved. If not, your dose may need to be increased. In some cases, omeprazole may cause side effects such as: headaches diarrhoea nausea vomiting Self-help tips for indigestion in pregnancy You may not need medicine to control your symptoms. Your GP or midwife may suggest some of the following changes to your diet and lifestyle. In many cases, these changes can be enough to ease your symptoms. Stop smoking to banish indigestion Smoking when you're pregnant can cause indigestion and seriously affect your health, as well as the health of your unborn baby. Smoking increases the risk of:  your baby being born prematurely (before week 37 of your pregnancy) your baby being born with a low birth weight cot death, or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) When you smoke, the chemicals you inhale can contribute to your indigestion. These chemicals can cause the ring of muscle at the lower end of your oesophagus to relax. This allows stomach acid to leak back up into your oesophagus more easily (known as acid reflux). If you smoke, quitting is the best thing that you can do for your own and your baby's health. You can speak to your GP or midwife for more information, or you can call the NHS Smokefree Helpline, which offers support and encouragement to help you quit smoking. You can call them on 0300 123 1044 or go to the NHS Smokefree website. Here are 8 steps to take to help you stop smoking right away. Avoid alcohol to ease indigestion Drinking alcohol can contribute to the symptoms of indigestion. During pregnancy, it can also put your unborn baby at risk of developing serious birth defects. Find out more about alcohol and pregnancy. The Department of Health recommends that all pregnant women avoid drinking alcohol completely during pregnancy. It advises that if you do choose to drink while you're pregnant, to minimise risks to your baby you should not drink more than 1-2 units of alcohol once or twice a week, and should not get drunk. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant should avoid drinking alcohol in the first three months of pregnancy because there may be an increased risk of miscarriage. One UK unit is 10ml (or eight grams) of pure alcohol. This is equal to:  half a pint of beer, lager or cider at 3.5% alcohol by volume (ABV: you can find this on the label) a single measure (25ml) of spirit, such as whisky, gin, rum or vodka, at 40% ABV  half a standard (175ml) glass of wine at 11.5% ABV You can find out how many units there are in different types and brands of drinks with the Drinkaware unit calculator. If you have difficulty cutting down what you drink, talk to your midwife, doctor or pharmacist. Confidential help and support is available from local counselling services (look in the telephone directory or contact Drinkline on 0300 123 1110). Eat healthily to avoid indigestion You are more likely to get indigestion if you are very full, so regularly eating large amounts of food may make your symptoms worse. If you are pregnant, it can be tempting to eat more than you would normally, but this may not be good for you or your baby. You don't need to \"eat for two\". During pregnancy you do not need to go on a special diet, but it is important to eat a variety of different foods every day to get the right balance of nutrients that you and your baby need. Find out more about eating a healthy diet in pregnancy and foods to avoid. Change your eating habits In some cases, you may be able to control your indigestion by making changes to the way you eat. For example:  it may help to eat smaller meals more frequently, rather than larger meals three times a day avoid eating within three hours of going to bed at night sit up straight when you eat because this will take the pressure off your stomach Drinking a glass of milk may relieve heartburn (the burning sensation from stomach acid leaking up into your oesophagus). You may want to keep a glass of milk beside your bed in case you wake up with heartburn in the night. Avoid indigestion triggers You may find that your indigestion is made worse by certain triggers, such as:  drinking fruit juice eating chocolate bending over Make a note of any particular food, drink or activity that seems to make your indigestion worse and avoid them if possible. This may mean: eating less rich, spicy and fatty foods cutting down on drinks that contain caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola (find out more about caffeine and pregnancy) Prop your head up When you go to bed, use a couple of pillows to prop your head and shoulders up, or raise the head of your bed by a few inches by putting something underneath the mattress. The slight slope should help prevent stomach acid from moving up into your oesophagus while you sleep.  Prescription medicines Speak to your GP if you are taking medication for another condition, such as antidepressants or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and you think it may be contributing to your indigestion. Your GP may be able to prescribe an alternative medicine. Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are advised to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care.

They usually happen during a heatwave or in a hot climate, but can also occur when you're doing very strenuous physical exercise. Heat exhaustion is where you become very hot and start to lose water or salt from your body, which leads to the symptoms listed below and generally feeling unwell. Heatstroke is where the body is no longer able to cool itself and a person's body temperature becomes dangerously high (sunstroke is when this is caused by prolonged exposure to direct sunlight). Heatstroke is less common, but more serious. It can put a strain on the brain, heart, lungs, liver and kidneys, and can be life-threatening. If heat exhaustion isn't spotted and treated early on, there's a risk it could lead to heatstroke. Signs and symptoms Heat exhaustion or heatstroke can develop quickly over a few minutes, or gradually over several hours or days.  Signs of heat exhaustion can include: tiredness and weakness feeling faint or dizzy a decrease in blood pressure a headache muscle cramps feeling and being sick heavy sweating intense thirst a fast pulse urinating less often and having much darker urine than usual  If left untreated, more severe symptoms of heatstroke can develop, including confusion, disorientation, seizures (fits) and a loss of consciousness. What to do If you notice that someone has signs of heat exhaustion, you should: get them to lie down in a cool place \u2013 such as a room with air conditioning or somewhere in the shade remove any unnecessary clothing to expose as much of their skin as possible cool their skin \u2013 use whatever you have available, such as a cool, wet sponge or flannel, cold packs around the neck and armpits, or wrap them in a cool, wet sheet fan their skin while it's moist \u2013 this will help the water to evaporate, which will help their skin cool down get them to drink fluids \u2013 this should ideally be water, fruit juice or a rehydration drink, such as a sports drink Stay with the person until they're feeling better. Most people should start to recover within 30 minutes. If the person is unconscious, you should follow the steps above and place the person in the recovery position until help arrives (see below). If they have a seizure, move nearby objects out of the way to prevent injury. When to get medical help Severe heat exhaustion or heatstroke requires hospital treatment. You should call 999 for an ambulance if: the person doesn't respond to the above treatment within 30 minutes the person has severe symptoms, such as a loss of consciousness, confusion or seizures Continue with the treatment outlined above until the ambulance arrives.  If the person is feeling better after using the above measures, but you have any concerns about them, contact your GP or NHS 111 for advice. Who's most at risk? Anyone can develop heat exhaustion or heatstroke during a heatwave or while doing heavy exercise in hot weather. However, some people are at a higher risk. These include: elderly people babies and young children people with a long-term health condition, such as diabetes or a heart or lung condition people who are already ill and dehydrated (for example, from gastroenteritis) people doing strenuous exercise for long periods, such as military soldiers, athletes, hikers and manual workers You're more likely to experience problems if you're dehydrated, there's little breeze or ventilation, or you're wearing tight, restrictive clothing. Certain medications can also increase your risk of developing heat exhaustion or heatstroke, including diuretics, antihistamines, beta-blockers, antipsychotics and recreational drugs, such as amphetamines and ecstasy. How to prevent heat exhaustion and heatstroke Heat exhaustion and heatstroke can often be prevented by taking sensible precautions when it's very hot. During the summer, check for heatwave warnings, so you're aware when there's a potential danger. The government uses a system called Heat-Health Watch to warn people about the chances of a heatwave. This is a system of four different warning levels based on the expected temperature. Public Health England (PHE) has also published a Heatwave plan for England (PDF, 1.19Mb), which suggests following the advice below during a heatwave to help prevent heat-related illnesses. Stay out of the heat Keep out of the sun between 11am and 3pm. If you have to go out in the heat, walk in the shade, apply sunscreen and wear a hat and light scarf. Avoid extreme physical exertion. Wear light, loose-fitting cotton clothes. If you're travelling to a hot country, be particularly careful for at least the first few days, until you get used to the temperature. Cool yourself down Have plenty of cold drinks, and avoid excess alcohol, caffeine and hot drinks. Eat cold foods, particularly salads and fruit with a high water content. Take a cool shower or bath. Sprinkle water over your skin or clothing, or keep a damp cloth on the back of your neck. If you\u2019re not urinating frequently or your urine is dark, it's a sign that you're becoming dehydrated and need to drink more. Keep your environment cool Keep windows and curtains that are exposed to the sun closed during the day, but open windows at night when the temperature has dropped. If possible, move into a cooler room, especially for sleeping. Electric fans may provide some relief. Turn off non-essential lights and electrical equipment, as they generate heat. Keep indoor plants and bowls of water in the house, as these can cool the air. In the longer term, it can help to have your loft and cavity walls insulated, as this will keep the heat in when it's cold and keep it out when it's hot. Using light-coloured, reflective external paint on your house may also be useful. Look out for others Keep an eye on isolated, elderly, ill or very young people and make sure they are able to keep cool. Ensure that babies, children or elderly people are not left alone in stationary cars. Check on elderly or sick neighbours, family or friends every day during a heatwave. Be alert and call a doctor or social services if someone is unwell or further help is needed. Read about how to prepare for a heatwave.

Prickly heat can develop anywhere on the body, but it usually appears on your face, neck, back, chest or thighs a few days after exposure to hot temperatures. The rash is made up of tiny spots or bumps that are surrounded by an area of red skin. The spots sometimes look like tiny blisters and can cause: mild swelling itching a stinging or intense prickling sensation Causes of prickly heat Prickly heat usually develops when a person sweats more than usual, such as during hot or humid weather. However, it's also possible to get prickly heat in the winter. The condition is caused when the body's sweat glands become blocked. Excessive sweating can result in sweat becoming trapped beneath your skin. The trapped sweat causes skin irritation and the characteristic heat rash. The symptoms of prickly heat are usually worse in areas that are covered by clothing. This is because clothing can make you sweat and sometimes causes friction (rubbing). Who gets prickly heat? Although anyone can get prickly heat, you're more at risk of developing it if you're in a hot climate where you sweat more than usual. The following also increase your risk: illness and immobility \u2013 long periods of time spent in bed can make you sweat more, particularly if you have warm bedding wearing too much clothing, particularly in the winter sitting too close to a fire or heater being overweight or obese \u2013 which is more likely to lead to excessive sweating Babies and children are also more at risk of getting prickly heat, because their sweat glands aren't fully developed. Treating prickly heat Prickly heat isn't a serious condition and rarely requires any specific treatment. The rash usually disappears after a few days. However, there are several things you can do to ease your symptoms: Avoid excessive heat and humidity \u2013 if you need to go outside, spend time in the shade or take a small fan with you. Further exposure to the heat will cause you to sweat more and may make your rash worse. Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration, especially in hot weather. Wear loose cotton clothing \u2013 avoid wearing synthetic fibres, such as polyester and nylon, which trap heat easier than natural fibres. Keep your skin cool \u2013 a cool bath or shower will cool you down, soothe your skin and help prevent further sweating. Staying in an air-conditioned room for a few hours a day will also provide considerable relief. You can also use a cold compress, but don't leave it on the skin for longer than 20 minutes. Use calamine lotion \u2013 this is available at most pharmacies and will help soothe sore and irritated skin. Try hydrocortisone cream \u2013 low-strength hydrocortisone cream is also available from pharmacies and is effective at treating very itchy and irritated areas of skin. However, avoid using it on your face and always follow the instructions. Antihistamine tablets may help control itching \u2013 but consult your GP first as they're not always suitable Read more about staying safe in the sun. Babies and rashes If your baby has a rash and appears to be unwell, you should visit your GP or contact NHS 111. Prickly heat is common in babies and doesn't cause any serious harm. However, if you're concerned, your GP will be able to confirm the cause of your baby's rash and give appropriate treatment. Read more about skin rashes in babies.

Menorrhagia can occur by itself or in combination with other symptoms, such as menstrual pain (dysmenorrhoea). Heavy bleeding does not necessarily mean there is anything seriously wrong, but it can affect a woman physically, emotionally and socially, and can cause disruption to everyday life. See your GP if you are worried about heavy bleeding during or between your periods. How much is heavy bleeding? It is difficult to define exactly what a heavy period is because the amount of blood lost during a period can vary considerably between women. The average amount of blood lost during a period is 30-40 millilitres (ml), with 9 out of 10 women losing less than 80ml. Heavy menstrual bleeding is considered to be 60-80ml or more in each cycle. However, it is rarely necessary to measure blood loss. Most women have a good idea about how much bleeding is normal for them during their period and can tell when this amount increases or decreases. A good indication that your blood loss is excessive is if: you feel you are using an unusually high number of tampons or pads you experience flooding (heavy bleeding) through to your clothes or bedding you need to use tampons and towels together What causes heavy periods? In most cases, no underlying cause of heavy periods is identified. However, some conditions and treatments have been linked to menorrhagia, including: uterine fibroids intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs)  anticoagulant medication polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Read more about the causes of heavy periods. Diagnosing heavy periods Your GP should be able to diagnose heavy periods from your symptoms alone. The cause of the problem may sometimes need to be investigated further. This will usually involve having a pelvic examination. A blood test may also sometimes be recommended to check for anaemia (iron deficiency). If a cause is still not found, then you may have an ultrasound scan. Read more about diagnosing heavy periods. Treating heavy periods  In some cases, heavy periods do not need to be treated, as they can be a natural variation and may not disrupt your lifestyle. If treatment is necessary, medication is most commonly used first. However, it may take a while to find the medication most suitable for you, as their effectiveness is different for everyone and some also act as contraceptives. If medication doesn't work, surgery may also be an option. Read more about treating heavy periods.

A period is part of a woman's menstrual cycle. The menstrual cycle is the time from the first day of a woman's period to the day before her next period. A period is a bleed from the womb (uterus) that is released through the vagina. It happens approximately every 28 days, although anywhere between 24 and 35 days is common. Periods can begin when girls are between 8 and 16 years old, but usually start around the age of 12. They continue every month until the menopause (when a woman's periods stop), which usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55.

Heel pain usually builds up gradually and gets worse over time. The pain is often severe and occurs when you place weight on your heel. In most cases, only one heel is affected, although estimates suggest that around a third of people have pain in both heels. The pain is usually worse first thing in the morning, or when you first take a step after a period of inactivity. Walking usually improves the pain, but it often gets worse again after walking or standing for a long time. Some people may limp or develop an abnormal walking style as they try to avoid placing weight on the affected heel. What causes heel pain? Most cases of heel pain are caused when a band of tissue in the foot, known as the plantar fascia, becomes damaged and thickens. Plantar fasciitis is the medical term for the thickening of the plantar fascia. The plantar fascia The plantar fascia is a tough and flexible band of tissue that runs under the sole of the foot. It connects the heel bone with the bones of the foot, and acts as a kind of shock absorber to the foot. Sudden damage, or damage that occurs over many months or years, can cause tiny tears (microtears) to develop inside the tissue of the plantar fascia. This can cause the plantar fascia to thicken, resulting in heel pain. The surrounding tissue and the heel bone can also sometimes become inflamed. Read more about the causes of heel pain. When to see your GP See your GP or a podiatrist (foot problems specialist) if you\u2019ve had persistent heel pain for a number of weeks and it hasn't cleared up. They should be able to diagnose the cause of your heel pain by asking about your symptoms and medical history and examining your heel and foot. Further tests will only usually be needed if you have additional symptoms that suggest the cause of your heel pain isn't inflammation, such as: numbness or a tingling sensation in your foot, which could be a sign of nerve damage in your feet and legs (peripheral neuropathy) your foot feels hot and you have a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F) or above, which could be a sign of a bone infection your heel is stiff and swollen, which could be a sign of arthritis Possible further tests that may be recommended include blood tests, X-rays, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or an ultrasound scan. Who gets heel pain? Heel pain is a common foot condition. An estimated one in 10 people will have at least one episode of heel pain at some point in their life. People who run or jog regularly, and older adults who are 40-60 years of age, are the two main groups affected by heel pain. Treating heel pain There are a number of treatments that can help relieve heel pain and speed up your recovery. These include: resting your heel \u2013 avoiding walking long distances and standing for long periods regular stretching \u2013 stretching your calf muscles and plantar fascia pain relief \u2013 using an icepack on the affected heel and taking painkillers, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) wearing well fitted shoes that support and cushion your feet \u2013 running shoes are particularly useful using supportive devices \u2013 such as orthoses (rigid supports that are put inside the shoe) or strapping Around four out of five cases of heel pain resolve within a year. However, having heel pain for this length of time can often be frustrating and painful. In about one in 20 cases, the above treatments aren't enough and surgery may be needed to release the plantar fascia.  Read more about treating heel pain. Preventing heel pain Being overweight can place excess pressure and strain on your feet, particularly on your heels. Losing weight and maintaining a healthy weight by combining regular exercise with a healthy, balanced diet can be beneficial for your feet. Wearing appropriate footwear is also important. Ideally, you should wear shoes with a low to moderate heel that supports and cushions your arches and heels. Avoid wearing shoes without heels. Read more about preventing heel pain.

Newborn blood spot screening involves taking a blood sample to find out if your baby has one of nine rare but serious health conditions. Most babies screened won't have any of these conditions but, for the few who do, the benefits of screening are enormous. Early treatment can improve their health and prevent severe disability, and even death. What does the blood spot test involve? When your baby is five days old, a health professional will prick their heel using a special device and collect four drops of blood on a special card. You can minimise any distress to your baby by cuddling and feeding them, and making sure they are warm and comfortable. Occasionally, the sample may need to be taken when your baby is six, seven or eight days old. Sometimes a second blood spot sample is needed. The reason for this will be explained to you. It doesn't necessarily mean there is something wrong with your baby. The test doesn't carry any known risks for your baby. Which conditions is the blood spot test for? The blood spot test screens for the following nine rare but serious conditions. If you, your partner, or a family member already has one of these conditions (or a family history of it), please tell your health professional straight away. Sickle cell disease About 1 in 2,000 babies born in the UK has sickle cell disease. This is a serious inherited blood disease. Sickle cell disease affects haemoglobin, the iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body. Babies who have this condition will need specialist care throughout their lives. People with sickle cell disease can have attacks of severe pain and get serious, life-threatening infections. They are usually anaemic because their blood cells have difficulty carrying oxygen. The blood spot screening test means that babies with sickle cell disease can receive early treatment to help them live healthier lives. This may include vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent serious illnesses. Pregnant women are also routinely tested for sickle cell disease early in pregnancy. Read more about sickle cell disease, or download leaflets for parents whose child has sickle cell disease. Cystic fibrosis About 1 in 2,500 babies born in the UK has cystic fibrosis. This inherited condition affects the digestion and lungs. Babies with cystic fibrosis may not gain weight well and frequently have chest infections. Babies with the condition can be treated early with a high-energy diet, medicines, and physiotherapy. Although children with cystic fibrosis may still become very ill, early treatment can help them live longer, healthier lives. Read more about cystic fibrosis, or download a leaflet for parents whose baby has suspected cystic fibrosis. Congenital hypothyroidism About 1 in 3,000 babies born in the UK has congenital hypothyroidism. Babies with congenital hypothyroidism do not have enough of the hormone thyroxine. Without thyroxine, babies do not grow properly and can develop learning disabilities. Babies who have the condition can be treated early with thyroxine tablets, and this allows them to develop normally. See more information about congenital hypothyroidism (CHT). Inherited metabolic diseases It is important to let your health professional know if you have a family history of a metabolic disease (a disease that affects your metabolism). Babies are screened for six inherited metabolic diseases. These are: phenylketonuria (PKU) medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)  isovaleric acidaemia (IVA)  glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1)  homocystinuria (pyridoxine unresponsive) (HCU)  About 1 in 10,000 babies born in the UK has PKU or MCADD. The other conditions are rarer, occurring in 1 in 100,000 to 150,000 babies. Without treatment, babies with inherited metabolic diseases can become suddenly and seriously ill. The diseases all have different symptoms. Depending on which one affects your baby, the condition may be life threatening or cause severe developmental problems. They can all be treated with a carefully managed diet and, in some cases, medicines as well. What are amino acids? Our bodies break down protein foods like meat and fish into amino acids (the building blocks of protein). Any amino acids that aren't needed are usually broken down and removed from the body. Babies with the inherited metabolic diseases that are screened for are unable to break down one or more amino acids. When levels of these amino acids get very high, they are harmful. Does my baby have to have the blood spot test? It's not compulsory, but it's recommended because it could save your baby's life.  You can choose to have screening for sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis or congenital hypothyroidism individually but you can only choose to have screening for all six inherited metabolic diseases or none at all. If you don't want your baby to be screened for any of these conditions, discuss it with your midwife. You should be given information about the blood spot test and the diseases it screens for in advance so you can make an informed decision for your baby. If you change your mind, babies can be screened up to the age of 12 months for all the conditions except cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis can only be screened for up to eight weeks of age. If you have any concerns about the tests, speak to your midwife, health visitor, or GP. When will we get the results? You should receive the results either by letter or from a health professional by the time your baby is six to eight weeks old. The results should be recorded in your baby's personal child health record (red book). It's important to keep this safe and take it with you to all your baby's appointments. If you have not received your baby's results, speak to your health visitor or GP. You will be contacted sooner if your baby screens positive. This means they're more likely to have one of the conditions tested for. If your baby is thought to have congenital hypothyroidism (CHT) or an inherited metabolic disease, you will be contacted the day the result is available, or the next working day, and given an appointment to see a specialist. If your baby is thought to have cystic fibrosis, you will be contacted before they are four weeks old. If your baby is thought to have sickle cell disease, you will be contacted before they are six weeks old. Screening for cystic fibrosis finds some babies who may be genetic carriers of the condition. These babies may need further testing. Screening for sickle cell disease also finds babies who are carriers of this or other red blood cell diseases. Carriers are healthy, although they can experience problems in situations where their bodies aren't getting much oxygen \u2013 for example, if they are having an anaesthetic. Parents of babies who are found to be carriers should be told by the time they are six to eight weeks old. Read more about what being a carrier means. What do the results mean? Most babies will have a normal result, which means it's unlikely that they have any of the conditions. A small number of babies will screen positive for one of the conditions. This doesn't mean they have the condition, but they are more likely to have it. They will be referred to a specialist for further tests. It's important to know that screening is not 100% certain. A baby with a negative screening result may later turn out to have the disease screened for. This is known as a false negative. Babies with a positive result sometimes turn out not to have the disease \u2013 what's known as a false positive. Occasionally, other medical conditions are picked up by blood spot test screening. For example, babies with beta thalassaemia major (a serious blood disease) will usually be detected. These babies will also need to be referred for early treatment. If your baby's blood spot test is positive The NHS screening programme has produced leaflets for parents who have been told their baby may have one of the conditions screened for. The leaflets provide information about the condition, further tests your baby may be offered, and what treatment is needed. They also answer parents' questions, including where to find support. See FAQs on blood spot screening. Find out what happens to your baby's blood spot card. The Screening Tests for You and Your Baby leaflet contains information about the blood spot screening test and the conditions it screens for. It is available in other languages.

It typically results in a rash and joint and tummy pain. HSP can affect people of any age, but the majority of cases occur in children under 10. The medical term for inflammation of the blood vessels is vasculitis. Blood vessels throughout the body become irritated and swollen, which can cause problems such as bleeding into the skin (resulting in a rash) and occasionally problems affecting the kidneys and bowel. HSP is not usually serious and most cases get better within a few weeks. Signs and symptoms The main symptoms of HSP are: a skin rash (purpura) that looks like small bruises or reddish-purple spots, usually on the buttocks, around the elbows and on the legs, and sometimes also on the face and upper body pain in the joints such as the knees and ankles, which can also become swollen, tender and warm tummy pain, which can develop suddenly before the rash appears HSP can also cause some other symptoms, including passing blood in your urine or stools, vomiting and diarrhoea. The condition is often associated with a previous infection (see below), so you or your child may initially have symptoms of an infection as well, such as a high temperature (fever) and feeling generally unwell. Possible complications HSP will usually get better on its own without causing any further problems, but occasionally it can lead to potentially serious complications. The main complications associated with HSP are problems affecting the kidneys, which may not occur until several weeks or months after the other symptoms have passed. This can cause: blood in your urine protein in your urine \u2013 you won't be able to see this yourself, but it can sometimes cause your urine to become \"frothy\" high blood pressure (hypertension) swelling (oedema), particularly around the eyes and ankles These symptoms eventually get better in most people, but in a small proportion the kidneys can stop working properly (kidney failure). HSP can also sometimes cause other problems, such as swelling and pain in the testicles (orchitis) or an abnormal folding in the gut (intussusception) that can lead to a blockage in your bowel. What causes HSP? HSP is caused by a problem with your immune system, possibly as a result of a previous infection. It has been known to occur after a bacterial or viral infection of the throat, airways or lungs (respiratory tract infection). HSP cannot be spread from person to person and doesn't usually run in families. Diagnosing HSP Your GP may suspect HSP based on your symptoms and medical history. To confirm a diagnosis, you may need to be referred to a hospital doctor for the following tests: blood tests \u2013 to see how well the kidneys are working, or to look for recent signs of infection urine dipstick test \u2013 this is used to detect traces of blood or protein in the urine, as these are signs of a problem with the kidneys blood pressure tests \u2013 high blood pressure can also be a sign that the kidneys are affected skin biopsy \u2013 a very small sample of skin is sent to the laboratory to be examined under a microscope (this is only usually done if the doctor is not certain whether it is HSP) If kidney problems are suspected, an ultrasound scan of your tummy and kidneys may also be carried out and you may have a kidney biopsy. This is where a small sample of kidney cells are removed using a needle that is inserted into your lower back. Treating HSP HSP is not usually serious. Most people can be treated at home with only occasional appointments to monitor the condition, although in severe cases admission to hospital may be necessary. The rash, joint pain and tummy pain will usually get better over days or weeks without any treatment. Anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen may help relieve joint pain if needed, but you should check with your doctor before using these as they shouldn't be taken by people with kidney or bowel problems. Paracetamol may be a suitable alternative and resting can also help. A steroid medication such as prednisolone can sometimes help severe tummy pain. Follow-up Due to the risk of kidney problems, you or your child's urine and blood pressure will need to be tested regularly during and after treatment. This may be done during trips to your GP or visits from a community nurse, although you may sometimes be asked to check your child's urine yourself and seek further advice if the results suggest there is a problem.  The exact timing of these tests can vary, but they will usually start off being daily (if testing is done at home) or weekly at first and become less frequent over time. If no problems develop, monitoring can usually stop after around six months. If any problems are detected, you or your child will be referred to a specialist for further tests and any necessary treatment. Testing your or your child's urine If you are asked to check your or your child's urine, you will be given containers to use and a special dipstick that detects small amounts of blood or protein in urine. Your doctor or a nurse will tell you how to use these and how often a urine sample should be tested. You'll need to collect a urine sample first thing in the morning, as this gives the most accurate reading. Your doctor or nurse will talk to you about what the results of the test mean and what you should do if they suggest there is a problem. When to seek medical advice Regardless of your dipstick results, you should contact your GP, nurse or hospital if you or your child: pass red, rusty or blood-coloured urine pass stools with blood in them develop very painful and swollen joints develop severe tummy pain have swollen or painful testicles Outlook HSP usually gets better on its own within about four to six weeks and doesn't generally cause any lasting problems. However, the condition can sometimes be severe and long-lasting \u2013 particularly in adults \u2013 and some people will get it more than once. Kidney problems usually pass without any complications or need for treatment, but in rare cases kidney failure or permanent kidney damage can develop. This is why it's important to check for any early signs of a problem with regular urine tests, as instructed by your doctor.

It's usually the result of a viral infection or liver damage caused by drinking alcohol. There are several different types of hepatitis, most of which are outlined below. Some types will pass without any serious problems, while others can be long-lasting (chronic) and cause scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), loss of liver function and, in some cases, liver cancer. This page covers: Symptoms of hepatitis Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Hepatitis D Hepatitis E Alcoholic hepatitis Autoimmune hepatitis Symptoms of hepatitis Short-term (acute) hepatitis often has no noticeable symptoms, so you may not realise you have it. If symptoms do develop, they can include: muscle and joint pain a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above feeling and being sick feeling unusually tired all the time a general sense of feeling unwell loss of appetite abdominal (tummy) pain dark urine pale, grey-coloured poo itchy skin yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) See your GP if you have any persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by hepatitis. Long-term (chronic) hepatitis also may not have any obvious symptoms until the liver stops working properly (liver failure) and may only be picked up during blood tests. In the later stages it can cause jaundice, swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, confusion, and blood in your stools or vomit. Hepatitis A Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus. It's usually caught by consuming food and drink contaminated with the poo of an infected person and is most common in countries where sanitation is poor. Hepatitis A usually passes within a few months, although it can occasionally be severe and even life-threatening. There's no specific treatment for it, other than to relieve symptoms such as pain, nausea and itching. Vaccination against hepatitis A is recommended if you're travelling to an area where the virus is common, such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, Central and South America, the Far East and Eastern Europe. Read more about hepatitis A. Hepatitis B Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus, which is spread in the blood of an infected person. It's a common infection worldwide and is usually spread from infected pregnant women to their babies, or from child-to-child contact. In rare cases, it can be spread through unprotected sex and injecting drugs. Hepatitis B is uncommon in the UK and most cases affect people who became infected while growing up in part of the world where the infection is more common, such as Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Most adults infected with hepatitis B are able to fight off the virus and fully recover from the infection within a couple of months. However, most people infected as children develop a long-term infection. This is known as chronic hepatitis B and it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Antiviral medication can be used to treat it. In the UK, vaccination against hepatitis B is recommended for people in high-risk groups, such as healthcare workers, people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, and people travelling to parts of the world where the infection is more common. Read more about hepatitis B. Hepatitis C Hepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus and is the most common type of viral hepatitis in the UK. It's usually spread through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person. In the UK, it's most commonly spread through sharing needles used to inject drugs. Poor healthcare practices and unsafe medical injections are the main way it\u2019s spread outside the UK. Hepatitis C often causes no noticeable symptoms, or only flu-like symptoms, so many people are unaware they're infected. Around one in four people will fight off the infection and be free of the virus. In the remaining cases, it will stay in the body for many years. This is known as chronic hepatitis C and can cause cirrhosis and liver failure. Chronic hepatitis C can be treated with very effective antiviral medications, but there's currently no vaccine available. Read more about hepatitis C. Hepatitis D Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus. It only affects people who are already infected with hepatitis B, as it needs the hepatitis B virus to be able to survive in the body. Hepatitis D is usually spread through blood-to-blood contact or sexual contact. It's uncommon in the UK, but is more widespread in other parts of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and South America. Long-term infection with hepatitis D and hepatitis B can increase your risk of developing serious problems, such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. There's no vaccine specifically for hepatitis D, but the hepatitis B vaccine (see above) can help protect you from it. Hepatitis E Hepatitis E is caused by the hepatitis E virus. It's usually caught by consuming food and drink contaminated with the poo of an infected person. It's now the most common cause of short-term (acute) hepatitis in the UK. Hepatitis E is generally a mild and short-term infection that doesn't require any treatment, but it can be serious in a small number of people. It can become chronic in people who have a suppressed immune system, such as those who have had an organ transplant.  There's no vaccine for hepatitis E, but you can reduce your risk by practising good food and water hygiene measures, particularly when travelling to parts of the world with poor sanitation. The British Liver Trust has more information about hepatitis E. Alcoholic hepatitis Alcoholic hepatitis is a type of hepatitis caused by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over many years. The condition is common in the UK and many people don't realise they have it because it doesn't usually cause any symptoms, although it can cause sudden jaundice and liver failure in some people. Stopping drinking will usually allow your liver to recover, but if you continue to drink alcohol excessively, there's a risk you could eventually develop cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer. You can reduce your risk of developing alcoholic hepatitis by controlling how much you drink. It's recommended that you don't regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week. Read more about alcohol-related liver disease and the health risks associated with alcohol. Autoimmune hepatitis Autoimmune hepatitis is a rare cause of long-term hepatitis in which the immune system attacks and damages the liver. Eventually, the liver can become so damaged that it stops working properly. Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis involves very effective medicines that suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. It's not clear what causes autoimmune hepatitis and it's not known whether anything can be done to prevent it. The British Liver Trust has more information about autoimmune hepatitis.

It's uncommon in the UK, but certain groups are at increased risk. This includes travellers to parts of the world with poor levels of sanitation, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs. Hepatitis A can be unpleasant, but it's not usually serious and most people make a full recovery within a couple of months. Some people, particularly young children, may not have any symptoms. But hepatitis A can occasionally last for many months and, in rare cases, it can be life-threatening if it causes the liver to stop working properly (liver failure). A hepatitis A vaccine is available for people at a high risk of infection. This page covers: Symptoms of hepatitis A When to get medical advice How you can get hepatitis A Vaccination against hepatitis A Treatments for hepatitis A Outlook for hepatitis A Symptoms of hepatitis A The symptoms of hepatitis A develop, on average, around four weeks after becoming infected, although not everyone will experience them. Symptoms can include: feeling tired and generally unwell joint and muscle pain a high temperature (fever) loss of appetite feeling or being sick pain in the upper-right part of your tummy yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) dark urine and pale stools itchy skin The symptoms will usually pass within a couple of months. Read more about symptoms of hepatitis A. When to get medical advice See your GP for advice if: you have symptoms of hepatitis A \u2013 a blood test can usually confirm whether you have the infection you might have been exposed to the hepatitis A virus recently but you don't have any symptoms \u2013 treatment given early on may be able to stop the infection developing you think you might need the hepatitis A vaccine \u2013 your GP can advise you about whether you should have the vaccine (see below) Although hepatitis A isn't usually serious, it's important to get a proper diagnosis to rule out more serious conditions with similar symptoms, such as hepatitis C or cirrhosis (scarring of the liver). It may also be necessary to test your friends, family and any sexual partners, in case you've spread the infection to them. How you can get hepatitis A Hepatitis A is most widespread in parts of the world where standards of sanitation and food hygiene are generally poor, such as parts of Africa, the Indian subcontinent, the Far East, the Middle East, and Central and South America. You can get the infection from: eating food prepared by someone with the infection who hasn't washed their hands properly or washed them in water contaminated with sewage drinking contaminated water (including ice cubes) eating raw or undercooked shellfish from contaminated water close contact with someone who has hepatitis A less commonly, having sex with someone who has the infection (this is particularly a risk for men who have sex with men) or injecting drugs using contaminated equipment Someone with hepatitis A is most infectious from around two weeks before their symptoms appear until about a week after the symptoms first develop. Read more about the causes of hepatitis A. Vaccination against hepatitis A Vaccination against hepatitis A isn't routinely offered in the UK because the risk of infection is low for most people. It's only recommended for people at an increased risk, including: close contacts of someone with hepatitis A people planning to travel to or live in parts of the world where hepatitis A is widespread, particularly if levels of sanitation and food hygiene are expected to be poor people with any type of long-term (chronic) liver disease men who have sex with other men people who inject illegal drugs people who may be exposed to hepatitis A through their job \u2013 this includes sewage workers, staff of institutions where levels of personal hygiene may be poor (such as a homeless shelter) and people working with monkeys, apes and gorillas The hepatitis A vaccine is usually available for free on the NHS for anyone who needs it. Read more about the hepatitis A vaccine. Treatments for hepatitis A There's currently no cure for hepatitis A, but it will normally pass on its own within a couple of months. You can usually look after yourself at home. While you're ill, it's a good idea to: get plenty of rest  take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen for any aches and pains \u2013 ask your GP for advice about this, as you may need to take lower doses than normal or avoid certain medications until you've recovered maintain a cool, well-ventilated environment, wear loose clothing, and avoid hot baths or showers to reduce any itching eat smaller, lighter meals to help reduce nausea and vomiting avoid alcohol to reduce the strain on your liver stay off work or school and avoid having sex until at least a week after your jaundice or other symptoms started practise good hygiene measures, such as washing your hands with soap and water regularly  Speak to your GP if your symptoms are particularly troublesome or haven't started to improve within a couple of months. They can prescribe medications to help with itchiness, nausea or vomiting, if necessary. Read more about treating hepatitis A. Outlook for hepatitis A For most people, hepatitis A will pass within two months and there will be no long-term effects. Once it passes, you normally develop life-long immunity against the virus. For around 1 in every 7 people with the infection, the symptoms may come and go for up to 6 months before eventually passing. Life-threatening complications such as liver failure are rare, affecting less than 1 in every 250 people with hepatitis A. People most at risk include those with pre-existing liver problems and elderly people. If liver failure does occur, a liver transplant is usually needed to treat it.  Page last reviewed: 20\/04\/2016 Next review due: 20\/04\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It often doesn't cause any obvious symptoms in adults and typically passes in a few months without treatment, but in children it often persists for years and may eventually cause serious liver damage. Hepatitis B is less common in the UK than other parts of the world, but certain groups are at an increased risk. This includes people originally from high-risk countries, people who inject drugs, and people who have unprotected sex with multiple sexual partners. A hepatitis B vaccine is available for people at high risk of the condition. This page covers: Symptoms of hepatitis B When to get medical advice Treatments for hepatitis B How hepatitis B is spread Preventing hepatitis B Outlook for hepatitis B Symptoms of hepatitis B Many people with hepatitis B won't experience any symptoms and may fight off the virus without realising they had it. If symptoms do develop, they tend to occur two or three months after exposure to the hepatitis B virus. Symptoms of hepatitis B include: flu-like symptoms, including tiredness, a fever, and general aches and pains loss of appetite feeling and being sick diarrhoea tummy (abdominal) pain yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) These symptoms will usually pass within one to three months (acute hepatitis B), although occasionally the infection can last for six months or more (chronic hepatitis B). Read more about the symptoms of hepatitis B. When to get medical advice Hepatitis B can be serious, so you should get medical advice if: you think you may have been exposed to the hepatitis B virus \u2013 emergency treatment can help prevent infection if given within a few days of exposure you have symptoms associated with hepatitis B you're at a high risk of hepatitis B \u2013 high-risk groups include people born in a country where the infection is common, babies born to mothers infected with hepatitis B, and people who have ever injected drugs You can go to your local GP surgery, drug service, genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic or sexual health clinic for help and advice. A blood test can be carried out to check if you have hepatitis B or have had it in the past. The hepatitis B vaccine may also be recommended to reduce your risk of infection. Treatments for hepatitis B Treatment for hepatitis B depends on how long you've been infected for: if you've been exposed to the virus in the last few days, emergency treatment can help stop you becoming infected if you've only had the infection for a few weeks or months (acute hepatitis B), you may only need treatment to relieve your symptoms while your body fights off the infection if you've had the infection for more than six months (chronic hepatitis B), you may be offered treatment with medicines that can keep the virus under control and reduce the risk of liver damage Chronic hepatitis B often requires long-term or lifelong treatment and regular monitoring to check for any further liver problems. Read more about treating hepatitis B. How hepatitis B is spread The hepatitis B virus is found in the blood and bodily fluids, such as semen and vaginal fluids, of an infected person. It can be spread by: a mother to her newborn baby, particularly in countries where the infection is common \u2013 read more about hepatitis B in pregnancy within families (child to child) in countries where the infection is common injecting drugs and sharing needles and other drug equipment, such as spoons and filters having sex with an infected person without using a condom having a tattoo, body piercing, or medical or dental treatment in an unhygienic environment with unsterilised equipment sharing toothbrushes or razors contaminated with infected blood Hepatitis B isn't spread by kissing, holding hands, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or sharing crockery and utensils. Read more about the causes of hepatitis B. Preventing hepatitis B A vaccine that offers protection against hepatitis B is available for people at high risk of the infection. This includes: babies born to infected mothers close family and sexual partners of someone with hepatitis B people travelling to or from a part of the world where hepatitis B is widespread, such as sub-Saharan Africa, east and southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands people who inject drugs or have a sexual partner who injects drugs people who change their sexual partner frequently men who have sex with men The hepatitis B vaccine isn't given as part of the routine vaccination schedule and sometimes you may have to pay for it. Read more about hepatitis B vaccination. Outlook for hepatitis B The vast majority of people infected with hepatitis B in adulthood are able to fight off the virus and fully recover within one to three months. Most will then be immune to the infection for life. Babies and children with hepatitis B are more likely to develop a chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis B affects around: 90% of babies with hepatitis B 20% of older children with hepatitis B 5% of adults with hepatitis B Although treatment can help, there's a risk that people with chronic hepatitis B could eventually develop life-threatening problems such as scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) or liver cancer.

However, with modern treatments it's often possible to cure the infection and most people with it will have a normal life expectancy. It's estimated that around 215,000 people in the UK have hepatitis C. You can become infected with it if you come into contact with the blood of an infected person. Symptoms of hepatitis C Hepatitis C often doesn't have any noticeable symptoms until the liver has been significantly damaged. This means many people have the infection without realising it. When symptoms do occur, they can be mistaken for another condition. Symptoms can include: flu-like symptoms, such as muscle aches and a high temperature (fever) feeling tired all the time loss of appetite abdominal (tummy) pain feeling and being sick The only way to know for certain if these symptoms are caused by hepatitis C is to get tested (see below). Read more about the symptoms of hepatitis C. How do you get hepatitis C? The hepatitis C virus is usually spread through blood-to-blood contact. Some ways the infection can be spread include: sharing unsterilised needles \u2013 particularly needles used to inject recreational drugs  sharing razors or toothbrushes from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby through unprotected sex \u2013 although this is very rare In the UK, most hepatitis C infections occur in people who inject drugs or have injected them in the past. It's estimated that around half of those who inject drugs have the infection. Read more about the causes of hepatitis C. Getting tested for hepatitis C Seek medical advice if you have persistent symptoms of hepatitis C, or there's a risk you're infected, even if you don't have any symptoms. A blood test can be carried out to see if you have the infection.  Your GP, sexual health clinic, GUM (genitourinary medicine) clinic or drug treatment service all offer testing for hepatitis C. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent or limit any damage to your liver and help ensure the infection isn't passed on to other people. Read more about testing for hepatitis C. Treatments for hepatitis C Hepatitis C can be treated with a combination of medicines that stop the virus multiplying inside the body. These usually need to be taken for several months. Most people will take two main medications called pegylated interferon (a weekly injection) and ribavirin (a capsule or tablet), although newer tablet-only treatments are likely to replace the interferon injections for most people in the near future. These newer hepatitis C medications have been found to make treatment more effective. They include simeprevir, sofosbuvir and daclatasvir. Using the latest medications, up to 90% or more of people with hepatitis C may be cured. However, it's important to be aware that you won't be immune to the infection and should take steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected again (see below). Read more about treating hepatitis C and living with hepatitis C. Complications of hepatitis C If the infection is left untreated for many years, some people with hepatitis C will develop scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). Over time, this can cause the liver to stop working properly. In severe cases, life-threatening problems such as liver failure (where the liver loses most or all of its functions) or liver cancer can eventually develop. Treating hepatitis C as early as possible can help reduce the risk of these problems occurring. Read more about the complications of hepatitis C. Preventing hepatitis C There's no vaccine for hepatitis C, but there are ways to reduce your risk of becoming infected, such as: not sharing any drug-injecting equipment with other people \u2013 including needles and other equipment such as syringes, spoons and filters not sharing razors or toothbrushes that might be contaminated with blood The risk of getting hepatitis C through sex is very low. However, it may be higher if blood is present, such as menstrual blood or from minor bleeding during anal sex. Condoms aren't usually necessary to prevent hepatitis C for long-term heterosexual couples, but it's a good idea to use them when having anal sex or sex with a new partner.

However, being 'natural' doesn't necessarily mean they're safe for you to take. Herbal medicines, just like conventional medicines, will have an effect on the body and can be potentially harmful if not used correctly. They should therefore be used with the same care and respect as conventional medicines. If you're consulting your doctor or pharmacist about health matters, or are about to undergo surgery, always tell them about any herbal medicines you're taking. This page covers: Potential issues with herbal medicines Who should avoid herbal medicines? Herbal medicines and surgery What to look for when buying a herbal medicine Risks of buying herbal medicines online or by mail order Reporting side effects Potential issues with herbal medicines If you're taking or plan to take any herbal medicines, be aware of the following: They may cause problems if you're taking other medicines. They could result in reduced or enhanced effects of the medicine(s), including potential side effects. You may experience a bad reaction or side effects after taking a herbal medicine. Not all herbal medicines are regulated. Remedies specially prepared for individuals don't need a licence and those manufactured outside the UK may not be subject to regulation. Evidence for the effectiveness of herbal medicines is generally very limited. Although some people find them helpful, in many cases their use tends to be based on traditional use rather than scientific research. Certain groups of people should be particularly wary of taking herbal medicines (see below). Who should avoid herbal medicines? Taking a herbal medicine may not be suitable for: people taking other medicines people with serious health conditions, such as liver or kidney disease people due to have surgery (see below) pregnant or breastfeeding women the elderly children \u2013 as with as with all medicines, herbal medicines should be kept out of sight and reach of children Speak to your doctor or pharmacist for advice before trying a herbal medicine if you fall into one of these groups. Herbal medicines and surgery It's important to tell your doctor if you take any herbal medicines before undergoing surgery. This is because: some herbal medicines might interfere with anaesthesia and other medicines used before, during or after procedures some herbal medicines may interfere with blood clotting and blood pressure, which may increase the risk of bleeding during or after surgery Your doctor may therefore advise you to stop taking any herbal medicines during the weeks leading up to your operation. What to look for when buying a herbal medicine If you want to try a herbal medicine, look out for a Traditional Herbal Registration (THR) marking on the product packaging. This means the medicine complies with quality standards relating to safety and manufacturing, and it provides information about how and when to use it. However, you should be aware that: THR products are intended for conditions that can be self-medicated and that don't require medical supervision, such as coughs, colds or general aches and pains using THR products for more serious conditions could be harmful, especially if you delay seeking medical advice claims made for THR products are based on traditional usage and not on evidence of the product's effectiveness a THR mark doesn't mean the product is completely safe for everyone to take You can find THR-registered products in your local health shop, pharmacy or supermarket. Risks of buying herbal medicines online or by mail order The risks of obtaining fake, substandard, unlicensed or contaminated medicines are increased by buying medicines online or by mail order. Unlicensed herbal medicines manufactured outside the UK may not be subject to regulation. They may be copies of licensed medicines, but made in unlicensed factories with no quality control. Some websites may appear to be legitimate, but are fronted by bogus doctors or pharmacists.  Herbal products sold online may also contain banned ingredients and toxic substances. You can find a list of banned and restricted herbal ingredients on the GOV.UK website. Herbal slimming products and sexual health products, for example, are best avoided because they have been found to contain dangerous ingredients, including pharmaceutical ingredients, which aren\u2019t stated on the label. Reporting side effects You can report any side effect or adverse reaction to a herbal medicine using the Yellow Card Scheme run by the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). This can help the MHRA identify new side effects or risks associated with medicines, including herbal remedies. You should report adverse reactions or side effects if: you suspect the side effect or adverse reaction was caused by a conventional medicine or herbal medicine you were taking the side effect occurs when you're taking more than one medicine or herbal  medicine It's important to include as much detail as possible, particularly any brand name or manufacturer's details relating to the herbal medicine. In the past, Yellow Card reports have been used to identify interactions between St John's wort and other medicines, and to highlight the use of dangerous substances such as mercury, lead and arsenic in unlicensed Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicines.

It's used to treat some types of breast cancer and stomach cancer (see below). HER2 HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is a type of protein. HER2 is present in all human cells, but in certain types of cancer the levels are unusually high. High levels of HER2 are found in some types of breast and stomach cancer. These are known as HER2 positive cancers. About one in five cases of breast cancer and stomach cancer are HER2 positive. Herceptin can be used to help control the growth of cancerous cells that contain high amounts of HER2. It works by blocking the effects of the protein and encourages the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence system) to attack the abnormal cells. When Herceptin is used Herceptin can be used to treat: early HER2 positive breast cancer, following surgery and\/or radiotherapy and chemotherapy to reduce the risk of the cancer re-occurring advanced HER2 positive breast cancer that has spread from the breast (metastatic breast cancer) \u2013 it can be given on its own or in combination with chemotherapy advanced HER2 positive stomach cancer that has spread out of the stomach (metastatic stomach cancer) advanced HER2 gastro-oesophageal cancer; where the oesophagus (food pipe) meets the stomach Herceptin can't cure metastatic breast and stomach cancers, but it can slow their growth and increase survival time. How Herceptin is given Herceptin is given by infusion (where the medication is fed slowly into your bloodstream through a drip), or by subcutaneous injection (an injection with a fine needle under the skin). The treatment will be carried out at a hospital or clinic, and a session usually lasts about an hour. The number of sessions you need will depend on the type of cancer and how advanced it is. The first session will be longer because you'll be monitored for any unusual reactions to herceptin. If you're being treated for breast cancer, you'll need treatment every one to three weeks. Stomach cancer is usually treated with a session once every three weeks. Early-stage breast cancer will require treatment for a year. In cases of breast or stomach cancer that has spread, treatment will be needed for as long as it's controlling the cancer. Cautions Herceptin isn't usually recommended for people with pre-existing heart problems or poorly controlled high blood pressure (hypertension). This is because it can cause heart problems. If you need to take herceptin, your heart will be regularly tested to make sure there are no problems. Herceptin isn't usually recommended during pregnancy because it can harm the developing baby. You should avoid becoming pregnant if you're taking herceptin and for seven months after taking it. Your GP will be able to advise you about contraception. Side effects of Herceptin Side effects are most frequently experienced immediately after treatment with Herceptin. They usually last a few hours and tend to become milder and less frequent the more treatments you have. Commonly reported side effects that affect more than one in 10 people include: an inital reaction to the medication \u2013 it can cause chills, a high temperature, swelling of the face and lips, headache, hot flushes, feeling sick, wheezing and breathlessness soreness at the injection site tiredness \u2013 in most cases, energy levels are back to normal six to 12 months after treatment has finished an itchy red rash can develop on the skin diarrhoea \u2013 this tends to affect about one in three people and is usually mild heart problems \u2013 such as palpitations or an irregular heartbeat; these symptoms should improve after treatment finishes pain in your muscles, joints, chest or abdomen high blood pressure (hypertension) or low blood pressure (hypotension) sore, red eyes (conjunctivitis) watery eyes runny nose shaking (tremor) hot flushes dizziness You can read more about the possible side effects of Herceptin, including the less common side effects, on Cancer Research UK. Tell the doctor in charge of your care if you experience particularly troublesome side effects after taking Herceptin. Medicines are available to treat some of the side effects.

In 2011, just under 50,000 women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Most women who get it (8 out of 10) are over 50, but younger women, and in rare cases, men, can also get breast cancer. If it's treated early enough, breast cancer can be prevented from spreading to other parts of the body. The breasts The breasts are made up of fat, connective tissue and thousands of tiny glands called lobules, which produce milk. When a woman has a baby, the milk is delivered to the nipple through tiny tubes called ducts, which allow her to breastfeed. The body is made up of billions of tiny cells, which usually grow and multiply in an orderly way. New cells are only produced when and where they're needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably. Read more about the causes of breast cancer. Symptoms of breast cancer Breast cancer can have a number of symptoms, but the first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue. Most breast lumps aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by your doctor. You should also see your GP if you notice any of the following: a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts discharge from either of your nipples (which may be streaked with blood) a lump or swelling in either of your armpits dimpling on the skin of your breasts a rash on or around your nipple a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast Breast pain isn't usually a symptom of breast cancer. Learn more about the symptoms of breast cancer. After examining your breasts, your GP may refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests. This might include a mammography (breast screening) or a biopsy. Read more about breast screening and how breast cancer is diagnosed. Types of breast cancer There are several different types of breast cancer, which can develop in different parts of the breast. Breast cancer is often divided into non-invasive and invasive types. Non-invasive breast cancer Non-invasive breast cancer is also known as cancer or carcinoma in situ. This cancer is found in the ducts of the breast and hasn't developed the ability to spread outside the breast. This form of cancer rarely shows as a lump in the breast that can be felt, and is usually found on a mammogram (see below). The most common type of non-invasive cancer is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Invasive breast cancer Invasive cancer has the ability to spread outside the breast, although this doesn't necessarily mean it has spread. The most common form of breast cancer is invasive ductal breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the breast ducts. Invasive ductal breast cancer accounts for about 80% of all breast cancer cases and is sometimes called \"no special type\". Other types of breast cancer Other less common types of breast cancer include invasive lobular breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the milk-producing lobules, inflammatory breast cancer and Paget's disease of the breast. It's possible for breast cancer to spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymph nodes (small glands that filter bacteria from the body) or the bloodstream. If this happens, it's known as \"secondary\" or \"metastatic\" breast cancer. Breast cancer screening About one in eight women are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. There's a good chance of recovery if it's detected in its early stages. For this reason, it's vital that women check their breasts regularly for any changes and always get any changes examined by their GP. Mammographic screening (where X-ray images of the breast are taken) is the best available method of detecting an early breast lesion. However, you should be aware that a mammogram might fail to detect some breast cancers. It might also increase your chances of having extra tests and interventions, including surgery. Women with a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer may be offered screening and genetic testing for the condition. As the risk of breast cancer increases with age, all women who are 50-70 years old are invited for breast cancer screening every three years. Women over 70 are also entitled to screening and can arrange an appointment through their GP or local screening unit. The NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47-73. Read more about breast screening and find breast cancer screening services near you. Treating breast cancer If cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads to nearby parts of the body. Breast cancer is treated using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgery is usually the first type of treatment you'll have, followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments. The type of surgery and the treatment you have afterwards will depend on the type of breast cancer you have. Your doctor will discuss the best treatment plan with you. Read a document listing the one-year net survival estimates by CCG for breast cancer In a small proportion of women, breast cancer is discovered after it's spread to other parts of the body (metastasis). Secondary cancer, also called advanced or metastatic cancer, isn't curable, so the aim of treatment is to achieve remission (symptom relief). Read more about treating breast cancer. How well your local NHS performs Clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) are NHS organisations that organise the delivery of NHS services in England. They play a major role in achieving good health outcomes for the local population that they serve. You can now check how your local CCG compares against others for breast cancer survival (PDF, 900 Kb). Preventing breast cancer As the causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood, it's not possible to know if it can be prevented altogether. If you're at increased risk of developing the condition, some treatments are available to reduce the risk. Studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions, there are benefits for women who maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly and who have a low intake of saturated fat and alcohol. It's been suggested that regular exercise can reduce your risk of breast cancer by as much as a third. If you've been through the menopause, it's particularly important that you're not overweight or obese. This is because being overweight or obese causes more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer. Read more about preventing breast cancer. Living with breast cancer Being diagnosed with breast cancer can affect daily life in many ways, depending on what stage it's at and what treatment you're having. How women cope with their diagnosis and treatment varies from person to person. You can be reassured that there are several forms of support available, if you need it. For example: your family and friends can be a powerful support system you can communicate with other people in the same situation find out as much as possible about your condition don't try to do too much or overexert yourself make time for yourself Read more about living with breast cancer.

It's sometimes spelt hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and is also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. Typical symptoms are persistent nosebleeds and visible red spots in certain places on the body \u2013 typically on the fingertip pads, on the lips and tongue, and on mucous membranes such as the lining of the nose and gut (see What are the symptoms?). It affects about 1 in 5,000 people. What happens in HHT? In HHT, some of the blood vessels do not develop properly. Normally, the arteries branch off into smaller and smaller blood vessels until they reach a network of capillaries (tiny blood vessels) that feed the body tissues and organs. Blood pressure drops in this network of capillaries, before the blood flows on into veins and back to the heart. In HHT, some of the blood vessels from the arteries join directly with the veins. These abnormal connections are called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). When AVMs occur in small vessels near the surface of the skin, where they are visible as red spots, they are known as telangiectasia. When they form in the lining of the nose or the gut, they can easily bleed. Frequent bleeding can lead to anaemia, and sometimes more serious problems (see What are the symptoms?). What causes HHT?  Someone with HHT will have a faulty gene (genetic mutation) and, usually, this will have been inherited from one of their parents. This gene normally provides instructions for making certain proteins found in the lining of the blood vessels. In HHT, the gene cannot produce this protein, or the protein it produces is abnormal. You only need to have one copy of the faulty gene to develop HHT. What are the symptoms? Symptoms usually start in childhood or in the teenage years. Nosebleeds Often, the first sign is developing nosebleeds. They can start at any age, often in childhood. Nosebleeds may be frequent and persistent, but can improve with age. They happen because of the abnormal blood vessels in the lining of the nose. The loss of blood can lead to iron-deficiency anaemia, if the iron is not replaced through the diet and with iron supplements. Red or purple spots under the skin (telangiectasia) From about 20-30 years old (sometimes earlier), abnormal blood vessels \u2013 telangiectasia \u2013 may start to appear just underneath the skin, which show as red or purple spots. Telangiectasia typically form on the fingertip pads, the lips, and the lining of the nose or the gut. Sometimes, they can form on the ears and face. They tend to increase in number with age. They're usually just a cosmetic problem, although they may sometimes bleed. Abnormal blood vessels (AVMs) inside the body  Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can form inside the body organs and tissues. Many people with AVMs won't experience any symptoms, and are not even aware they have them. They can cause preventable complications, but most people live well with their AVMs. Decisions to treat AVMs are based on the safety of the treatment versus the risks of leaving the AVM untreated. Some AVMs are worth treating, and some are better left alone. AVMs in the lungs (pulmonary AVMs) often lead to low blood oxygen levels, and can allow blood clots to pass through to the brain, which could result in a stroke. They can occasionally bleed, but this is not very common outside of pregnancy. There are safe treatments available and these are usually recommended when pulmonary AVMs are found. AVMs in the brain usually cause no symptoms, although they can irritate the surrounding brain tissue and cause seizures or headaches. They can also bleed, leading to a stroke, but whether they should be treated if they have not bled remains controversial. AVMs in other parts of the body usually cause no symptoms. How is HHT treated? There's no cure for HHT, but there are effective treatments and life expectancy is usually very good. Some patients can be managed by their GP, and some will need to be under the care of a specialist. Because there are increased risks during pregnancy for women with HHT (such as a slight increased risk of a major bleed or a stroke), it is recommended that if HHT is in the family, this is brought to the attention of the specialist in charge of the woman's care. Iron supplements Patients who have regular nosebleeds will probably lose a lot of iron through this loss of blood, especially if they also bleed from telangiectasia in the gut. It is important to replace the lost iron with iron supplements \u2013 dietary changes alone may not be enough. Read about the importance of iron and the treatment of anaemia with iron supplements and iron-rich food. Treatment of nosebleeds Those with severe nosebleeds may need emergency nasal packing, where the nose is packed with ribbon gauze or a special nasal sponge.  Some people may need to see an ear, nose and throat specialist for treatment. Laser therapy may help (see below). More severe cases may respond to skin grafting or other surgery. Blood transfusion after loss of blood If a lot of blood has been lost from bleeding inside the body or after nosebleeds, a blood transfusion may be needed. Read about blood transfusions. Laser treatment for telangiectasia Telangiectasia on the skin or in the lining of the nose can sometimes be improved with vascular laser or intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment. For the skin, a referral to a dermatologist is usually needed. Around two to four treatments a year may be needed, so the overall cost may be significant if the treatment is not available on the NHS. For the nose, a referral to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist is needed, and these treatments are usually available on the NHS. Laser and IPL machines produce narrow beams of light aimed at the visible blood vessels in the skin. The heat from the lasers damages the dilated veins and causes them to shrink so they are no longer visible, with minimal scarring or damage to the surrounding area. Laser treatment can cause pain, but most people do not need an anaesthetic. Treating AVMs inside the body AVMs in the body may require specialist treatment. Your HHT specialist will explain any procedures to you in more detail. For example, AVMs in the lung are usually treated, even if they are not causing any apparent problems. They are treated by embolisation, a procedure that blocks the blood supply to the AVM. A tiny plug is inserted inside the artery supplying the abnormal blood vessel. Embolisation has virtually replaced open surgery, and is normally carried out under sedation (which will help relax you during the procedure). For brain AVMs, embolisation, surgery and stereotactic radiotherapy (precisely delivering radiation to the blood vessel) are possible treatment options. Liver AVMs may require different types of specialist treatments. However, these treatments aren't always appropriate. Your specialist will explain why many AVMs, such as those in the liver and in the brain, may be better left alone, as the risks of invasive treatments may outweigh the potential benefits. Information about you If you have HHT, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

It's also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN). The peripheral nerves are found outside the main central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). They control the muscles and relay sensory information, such as the sense of touch, from the limbs to the brain. People with CMT may have: muscle weakness in the feet, ankles, legs and hands an awkward way of walking (gait) highly arched or very flat feet numbness in the feet, arms and hands The symptoms of CMT usually start to appear between the ages of five and 15, although they sometimes don't develop until well into middle age or later. CMT is a progressive condition. This means the symptoms slowly get worse, making everyday tasks increasingly difficult. Read more about the symptoms of CMT What causes CMT? CMT is caused by an inherited fault in one of the many genes responsible for the development of the peripheral nerves. This fault means the nerves become damaged over time. A child with CMT may have inherited the genetic fault responsible for the disease from one or both of their parents. There's no single faulty gene that causes CMT. There are many varieties of CMT that are caused by different genetic faults and these can be inherited in several different ways. The chances of passing CMT to your child depend on the specific genetic faults you and your partner carry. Read more about the causes of CMT. Testing for CMT See your GP if you think you may be developing symptoms of CMT. If your GP suspects CMT, they'll refer you to a neurologist (a doctor who specialises in treating conditions of the nervous system) for further tests to confirm the diagnosis. You should also see your GP if you or your partner have a family history of CMT and are considering having a baby. Your GP can refer you for genetic counselling, where you can discuss your concerns and the options available with a genetics specialist. Read more about diagnosing CMT. How CMT is treated There's currently no cure for CMT. However treatments can help relieve symptoms, aid mobility and increase the independence and quality of life for people with the condition. These treatments may include: physiotherapy and certain types of exercise occupational therapy walking aids In some cases, surgery may be needed to correct problems such as flat feet and muscle contractures (where muscles shorten and lose their normal range of movement). Read more about treating CMT. Living with CMT CMT isn't life-threatening and most people with the condition have the same life expectancy as a person without the condition. However, it can make everyday activities very difficult. Living with a long-term, progressive condition can also have a significant emotional impact. Some people find it helpful to speak to others with the condition through support groups. You may also benefit from a talking therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). You can find more information, support and practical advice about living with CMT on the CMT UK website. CMT UK is the main charity and support group for people with CMT in the UK.

HNPP is thought to affect between 1 in 50,000 and 1 in 20,000 people in the UK. Other terms for it are \"entrapment neuropathy\" and \"compression neuropathy\". It is just one of many inherited conditions that damage the peripheral nerves, which are collectively known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. What are the symptoms of HNPP? HNPP ranges in severity \u2013 some people get no symptoms at all or find it a minor nuisance, while others are so badly affected they can't even move the affected limb. Most people with HNPP have attacks of numbness, tingling and muscle weakness in: the leg or foot \u2013 which can make walking, climbing stairs and driving difficult or impossible, and can result in foot drop (inability to lift the front part of the foot because of muscle weakness) the elbow, wrist or hands \u2013 which can result in \"wrist drop\" and loss of sensation in the index finger and thumb (symptoms similar to those of carpal tunnel syndrome), making fine movements such as fastening buttons impossible These symptoms happen because the layer of protein covering and protecting the nerve (the myelin sheath) is faulty. For more information, see What's the cause? Some episodes last just a few minutes, while others can last months. Triggers Symptoms can be triggered by simple actions, usually: squashing the nerve \u2013 by leaning on an affected arm, for example  repetitive movement \u2013 you may be able to do an activity one day without problems, but find it increasingly difficult if the same activity is continued many days in a row (you're thought to be damaging more and more fibres inside the nerve each time)  stretching the vulnerable limb Progression of the disease HNPP is not life-threatening. How severe it is and the way it progresses can differ greatly from person to person. Symptoms usually start in the teenage years or 20s-30s, although they can sometimes develop later in life or in childhood. Some people start off with mild symptoms, or episodes in one particular area that come and go.  About half of people with HNPP fully recover after experiencing symptoms, never to have another episode, as the nerves have rebuilt their protective covering. But the nerves don't completely recover for everyone with HNPP. For some people, the nerve only partially heals after being damaged, and they are left with recurrent or permanent nerve symptoms and muscle problems. However, these symptoms are usually mild, and it's unusual to be left with a severe disability. What's the cause? We need two PMP22 genes, one from each parent, for the normal development of the peripheral nerves. These genes provide instructions for the creation of PMP22 protein, which makes up the protective outer layer of each nerve. This outer layer, which is a bit like the plastic coating that insulates a wire, is called myelin. In HNPP, one copy of the PMP22 gene is lost (deleted) so that people have only one copy of this gene. A person with HNPP will have inherited a faulty copy of the PMP22 gene from one of their parents. With only one normal PMP22 gene, their myelin is fragile and more susceptible to injury. Just the slightest pressure, stretch or repetitive movement on the nerve causes sections of the myelin to be lost, leading to muscle weakness \u2013 or \"pressure palsies\". Signals cannot be relayed to and from the muscles properly. How is it diagnosed? A diagnosis of HNPP is based on symptoms (such as recurrent loss of sensation in one particular area), evidence of a family history and electrical nerve tests. A genetic test will confirm the diagnosis. How is it managed? There's currently no cure for HNPP, but some of the symptoms can be treated, and lifestyle changes can make a huge difference. Lifestyle advice If you can feel any warning signs (such as tingling), stop what you're doing to try to prevent further damage to the nerve. It's wise to avoid: prolonged sitting with crossed legs leaning on elbows, resting the backs of arms on a chair or having someone rest on your arm repetitive movements of the wrists or elbows Make a note of the sorts of activities that trigger symptoms and change the way you do them next time \u2013 for example, use a machine or tool to do the work, or get someone to help you. An occupational therapist can advise on ways you can best carry out day-to-day activities.  Physiotherapy is not usually needed. A damaged nerve needs time to repair itself, so if you have muscle weakness, carry on using the limb just enough to keep the blood flowing to it to help it heal, but go easy and don't push it. If you're overweight, now may be a good time to lose the weight \u2013 if the disease gets worse, you may find it difficult to be active. Orthoses, splints and protective pads People with foot drop or wrist drop may benefit from an ankle-foot orthosis or wrist splint, which can be worn at night. Protective pads for the elbows and knees may prevent the nerves from being aggravated. A foam pad on top of the mattress may also lessen pressure on the affected nerve. Medication  If you're suffering from nerve pain, some antidepressants and anti-seizure drugs may help. Read more about medications for nerve pain.

HSP is also known as familial spastic paraparesis or Strümpell-Lorrain syndrome. A person with HSP is likely to have inherited an abnormal gene from their parents that causes the long nerves in their spine to deteriorate. These nerves control voluntary movement, so the muscles in the lower body don't receive the correct messages telling them to relax or contract. It leads to spasticity (stiff and rigid muscles) and weakness in the leg muscles, which progressively gets worse. Most forms of HSP mainly affect the lower body. The arms and hands are usually unaffected. On average, the symptoms of HSP start in mid-adulthood, although it can start as late as the age of 70 or in young children. What are the symptoms? Symptoms vary depending on the type of spastic paraplegia inherited. At first there may just be mild stiffness and slight difficulty with walking, which slowly worsens to uncontrollable shaking of the legs when walking, poor balance and unsteadiness. Many people with HSP develop foot drop, where they have difficulty lifting their toes and end up dragging them when they walk. They may keep tripping, especially if walking on uneven ground. Some may eventually need a walking aid or wheelchair, although not everyone will. Other symptoms in HSP are fatigue and bladder problems, such as urinary incontinence or a sense of urgency. How is it inherited? Most people with HSP will have inherited an abnormal gene from their parents. Occasionally, HSP occurs as a result of a new DNA error (mutation) when a child is conceived. In most cases, a child with HSP will have inherited the faulty gene from just one of their parents, and this dominates the corresponding normal gene they inherit from the other parent. This is known as autosomal dominant inheritance. Sometimes adults will carry a weaker version of the abnormal gene, which means they don't have symptoms but can pass on HSP to their children.  In some cases, a single copy of the faulty gene does not cause HSP. In these cases, children only develop HSP if they inherit the abnormal genes from both of their parents. This is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. About 70-80% of cases of HSP result from autosomal dominant inheritance, and the remainder from autosomal recessive inheritance. Can HSP be treated? HSP cannot be prevented, slowed or reversed, but treatments can relieve some symptoms and help the person manage day-to-day activities. For example: muscle relaxants such as baclofentizandine and botulinum (Botox) injections can help relieve spasticity regular physiotherapy is important for muscle strength and range of movement occupational therapy can help the person carry out daily activities more easily and regain as much independence as possible a lower leg brace (ankle-foot orthosis) can help foot drop (read more about the treatment of foot drop) surgery may occasionally be needed to release tendons or shortened muscles Outlook The outlook for people with HSP varies. Some people are very disabled and need a wheelchair, while others only have a mild disability and don't need any walking aid. Generally, many people with HSP lead relatively independent and active lives, even if they do need a wheelchair. HSP does not usually affect life expectancy.

A hernia usually develops between your chest and hips. In many cases, it causes no or very few symptoms, although you may notice a swelling or lump in your tummy (abdomen) or groin. The lump can often be pushed back in or disappears when you lie down. Coughing or straining may make the lump appear. This topic covers: Types of hernia When to seek medical advice Assessing a hernia Surgery for a hernia Types of hernia Some of the more common types of hernia are described below. Inguinal hernias Inguinal hernias occur when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh. This is the most common type of hernia and it mainly affects men. It's often associated with ageing and repeated strain on the abdomen. Femoral hernias Femoral hernias also occur when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh. They're much less common than inguinal hernias and tend to affect more women than men. Like inguinal hernias, femoral hernias are also associated with ageing and repeated strain on the abdomen. Umbilical hernias Umbilical hernias occur when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel pokes through your abdomen near your belly button (navel). This type of hernia can occur in babies if the opening in the abdomen through which the umbilical cord passes doesn't seal properly after birth. Adults can also be affected, possibly as a result of repeated strain on the abdomen. Hiatus hernias Hiatus hernias occur when part of the stomach pushes up into your chest by squeezing through an opening in the diaphragm (the thin sheet of muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen). This type of hernia may not have any noticeable symptoms, although it can cause heartburn in some people. It's not exactly clear what causes hiatus hernias, but it may be the result of the diaphragm becoming weak with age or pressure on the abdomen. Other types of hernia Other types of hernia that can affect the abdomen include: incisional hernias \u2013 where tissue pokes through a surgical wound in your abdomen that hasn't fully healed epigastric hernias \u2013 where fatty tissue pokes through your abdomen, between your navel and the lower part of your breastbone (sternum) spigelian hernias \u2013 where part of your bowel pokes through your abdomen at the side of your abdominal muscle, below your navel diaphragmatic hernias \u2013 where organs in your abdomen move into your chest through an opening in the diaphragm; this can also affect babies if their diaphragm doesn't develop properly in the womb muscle hernias \u2013 where part of a muscle pokes through your abdomen; they also occur in leg muscles as the result of a sports injury When to seek medical advice See your GP if you think you have a hernia. They may refer you to hospital for surgical treatment, if necessary. You should go the accident and emergency (A&E) department of your nearest hospital immediately if you have a hernia and you develop any of the following symptoms: sudden, severe pain vomiting difficulty passing stools (constipation) or wind the hernia becomes firm or tender, or can't be pushed back in These symptoms could mean that either:  the blood supply to a section of organ or tissue trapped in the hernia has become cut off (strangulation) a piece of bowel has entered the hernia and become blocked (obstruction) A strangulated hernia and obstructed bowel are medical emergencies and need to be treated as soon as possible. Assessing a hernia Your GP will usually be able to identify a hernia by examining the affected area. In some cases, they may refer you to a nearby hospital for an ultrasound scan to confirm the diagnosis or assess the extent of the problem. This is a painless scan where high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of part of the inside of the body. Once a diagnosis has been confirmed, your GP or hospital doctor will determine whether surgery to repair the hernia is necessary. A number of factors will be considered when deciding whether surgery is appropriate, including: the type of hernia \u2013 some types of hernia are more likely to become strangulated, or cause a bowel obstruction, than others the content of your hernia \u2013 if the hernia contains a part of your bowel, muscle or other tissue, there may be a risk of strangulation or obstruction your symptoms and the impact on your daily life \u2013 surgery may be recommended if your symptoms are severe or getting worse, or if the hernia is affecting your ability to carry out your normal activities your general health \u2013 surgery may be too much of a risk if your general health is poor Although most hernias won't get better without surgery, they won't necessarily get worse. In some cases, the risks of surgery outweigh the potential benefits. Surgery for a hernia There are two main ways surgery for hernias can be carried out: open surgery \u2013 where one cut is made to allow the surgeon to push the lump back into the abdomen keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery \u2013 this is a less invasive, but more difficult, technique where several smaller cuts are made, allowing the surgeon to use various special instruments to repair the hernia Most people are able to go home the same day or the day after surgery and make a full recovery within a few weeks. If your doctor recommends having surgery, it's important to be aware of the potential risks, as well as the possibility of the hernia recurring. Make sure you discuss the benefits and risks of the procedure with your surgeon in detail before having the operation.

Your muscles are usually strong and tight enough to keep your intestines and organs in place, but a hernia can develop if there are any weak spots. What is a femoral hernia? A femoral hernia is an uncommon type of hernia. It's estimated that only about 1 in every 20 groin hernias are femoral hernias, and the rest are inguinal hernias. Femoral hernias sometimes appear as a painful lump in the inner upper part of the thigh or groin. The lump can often be pushed back in or disappears when you lie down. Coughing or straining may make the lump appear. For information on other types of hernia, see:  inguinal hernia hiatus hernia umbilical hernia What causes a femoral hernia? A femoral hernia usually occurs when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh. It pushes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle wall (abdominal wall) into an area called the femoral canal. Unlike inguinal hernias, femoral hernias occur far more frequently in women, particularly older women. This is because of the wider shape of the female pelvis. Femoral hernias are rare in children. Femoral hernias can sometimes appear suddenly because of strain on the abdomen, such as: straining on the toilet if you have constipation carrying and pushing heavy loads They've also been linked to obesity and having a persistent, heavy cough. When is surgery needed? Femoral hernias can be repaired using surgery to push the bulge back into place and strengthen the weakness in the abdominal wall. Unlike some other types of hernia, treatment of femoral hernias is almost always recommended straight away because there's a higher risk of complications developing in these cases. Complications that can develop as a result of a femoral hernia include: obstruction \u2013 where a section of the bowel becomes stuck in the femoral canal, causing nausea, vomiting and stomach pain, as well as a painful lump in the groin strangulation \u2013 where a section of bowel becomes trapped and its blood supply is cut off; this requires emergency surgery within hours to release the trapped tissue and restore its blood supply, so it doesn't die Surgery gets rid of the hernia and prevents any serious complications, although there's a chance of it returning after the operation. What happens during surgery? There are two ways a femoral hernia repair can be performed: open surgery \u2013 where one cut is made to allow the surgeon to push the lump back into the abdomen laparoscopy (keyhole) surgery \u2013 a less invasive, but more difficult, technique where several smaller cuts are made, allowing the surgeon to use various special instruments to repair the hernia There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods. The type of surgery you have depends on which method suits you and your surgeon\u2019s experience. You should be able to go home the same day or the day after surgery. It's important to follow the hospital's instructions on how to look after yourself. This includes eating a good diet to avoid constipation, caring for the wound and not straining yourself too soon. Most people make a full recovery from femoral hernia repair within six weeks, although many people can return to driving, work and light activities within two weeks.

Femoral hernia repair is a routine operation with very few risks, although around 1% of hernias return after the operation. Other uncommon complications of femoral hernia repair include: developing a lump under the wound difficulty passing urine injury or narrowing of the femoral vein (which passes through the femoral canal) injury to the bowel temporary weakness of the leg injury to the nerves, causing pain or numbness in the groin area Complications are more likely if you're over 50 or have another illness, such as heart disease or breathing problems.

The diaphragm is a large, thin sheet of muscle between the chest and the abdomen (tummy). Hiatus hernia and heartburn A hiatus hernia itself rarely has any noticeable symptoms. However, it can cause a problem called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). GORD is where stomach acid leaks into the oesophagus (the tube that carries food to the stomach). It can occur if a hiatus hernia prevents the valve at the bottom of the oesophagus from working properly. Your oesophagus can become severely irritated, because it's not protected against stomach acid. This can cause symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, an unpleasant sour taste in your mouth, and swallowing problems (dysphagia). You should see your GP if you have frequent and severe symptoms of GORD. What causes a hiatus hernia? It's not exactly clear what causes hiatus hernia, but it may be the result of the diaphragm becoming weak with age, or pressure on the abdomen. Hiatus hernia can sometimes occur in newborn babies if the stomach or diaphragm doesn't develop properly. Who's affected Hiatus hernia can affect anyone, but it's more common in people who are: over 50 years of age overweight pregnant It's estimated that a third of people over 50 have a hiatus hernia. There's also a rare type of hiatus hernia that affects newborn babies, which is caused by a congenital defect of the stomach or diaphragm. Congenital means that it is present from birth. Types of hiatus hernia There are two main types of hiatus hernia. They are: sliding hiatus hernias \u2013 hernias that move up and down, in and out of the chest area (more than 80% of hiatus hernias are of this type) para-oesophageal hiatus hernias \u2013 also called rolling hiatus hernias, where part of the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus (about 5-15% of hiatus hernias are of this type) These pages mainly focus on sliding hiatus hernias. They can usually be diagnosed using an X-ray or an endoscopy, where a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end is used to examine the inside of the body. Read more about diagnosing a hiatus hernia. Treating a hiatus hernia Treatment for a sliding hiatus hernia usually focuses on relieving the symptoms of GORD, such as heartburn. Lifestyle changes and medication are the preferred treatments. Surgery is usually only recommended as an alternative to long-term medication or if other treatments haven't worked. Lifestyle advice may include: eating smaller, more frequent meals, rather than three large meals a day avoiding lying down (including going to bed) for three hours after eating or drinking removing any foods or drinks from your diet that make your symptoms worse   If a hiatus hernia isn't causing any noticeable problems, it doesn't usually need to be treated. Surgery is used to repair a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia if there's a risk of serious complications. Read more about treating a hiatus hernia. Further problems It's rare for a hiatus hernia to cause complications, but long-term damage to the oesophagus caused by leaking stomach acid can lead to ulcers, scarring and changes to the cells of the oesophagus, which can increase your risk of oesophageal cancer.

Your muscles are usually strong and tight enough to keep your intestines and organs in place, but a hernia can develop if there are any weak spots. What is an inguinal hernia? An inguinal (pronounced \"ingwinal\") hernia is the most common type of hernia. It can appear as a swelling or lump in your groin, or as an enlarged scrotum (the pouch containing the testicles). The swelling may be painful. The lump often appears when you're lifting something and disappears when you lie down. For information on other types of hernia see: femoral hernia hiatus hernia umbilical hernia What causes an inguinal hernia? An inguinal hernia usually occurs when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel, such as the intestine, pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh. It pushes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle wall (the abdominal wall) into an area called the inguinal canal. Inguinal hernias occur mainly in men. Most are thought to result from ageing, although they can occur at any age. This is because as you get older, the muscles surrounding your abdomen (tummy) can become weaker. Inguinal hernias can sometimes appear suddenly after putting pressure on the abdomen, such as straining on the toilet if you have constipation or carrying and pushing heavy loads. They have also been linked to having a persistent, heavy cough. When is surgery needed? Inguinal hernias can be repaired using surgery to push the bulge back into place and strengthen the weakness in the abdominal wall. The operation is usually recommended if you have a hernia that causes pain, severe or persistent symptoms, or if any serious complications develop. Complications that can develop as a result of an inguinal hernia include: obstruction \u2013 where a section of the bowel becomes stuck in the inguinal canal, causing nausea, vomiting and stomach pain, as well as a painful lump in the groin strangulation \u2013 where a section of bowel becomes trapped and its blood supply is cut off; this requires emergency surgery within hours to release the trapped tissue and restore its blood supply, so it doesn't die Surgery gets rid of the hernia to prevent any serious complications, but there's a chance it could return after the operation. What happens during surgery? There are two ways an inguinal hernia repair can be performed: open surgery \u2013 where one cut is made to allow the surgeon to push the lump back into the abdomen laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery \u2013 a less invasive, but more difficult, technique where several smaller cuts are made, allowing the surgeon to use various special instruments to repair the hernia There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods. The type of surgery you have depends on which method suits you and your surgeon\u2019s experience. You should be able to go home the same day or the day after surgery. It's important to follow the hospital's instructions on how to look after yourself. This includes eating a good diet to avoid constipation, caring for the wound and not straining yourself too soon. Most people make a full recovery from inguinal hernia repair within six weeks, although many people can return to driving, work and light activities within two weeks. Read more about: how an inguinal hernia repair is performed recovering from an inguinal hernia repair  Are there any risks from the operation? An inguinal hernia repair is a routine operation with very few risks. However, up to 10% of hernias come back at some point after surgery. Around 2-4% of hernias return within three years. Other potential complications of inguinal hernia repair include: blood or fluid building up in the space left by the hernia (this  usually gets better without treatment) painful swelling and bruising of the testicles or base of the penis (in men) pain and numbness in the groin area caused by a nerve being damaged or trapped during surgery damage to the blood supply to the testicle damage to the vas deferens \u2013 the tube that carries sperm to the testicles Complications are more likely if you're aged over 50, smoke or have another illness, such as heart disease or breathing problems.

Your muscles are usually strong and tight enough to keep your organs and intestines in place, but a hernia can develop if there are any weak spots. What is an umbilical hernia? Umbilical hernias are very common in infants and young children, especially in babies born prematurely. An umbilical hernia appears as a painless lump in or near the navel (belly button).  It may get bigger when laughing, coughing, crying or going to the toilet and may shrink when relaxing or lying down. In many cases, the umbilical hernia goes back in and the muscles reseal before the child's first birthday. Umbilical hernias can also develop in adults. Without treatment, the hernia will probably get worse over time. For information on other types of hernia, see: inguinal hernia femoral hernia hiatus hernia What causes an umbilical hernia? During pregnancy, the umbilical cord passes through an opening in the baby's abdomen (tummy). This opening should close shortly after birth, but in some cases the muscles don't seal completely. This leaves a weak spot in the surrounding muscle wall (abdominal wall). An umbilical hernia can develop when fatty tissue or a part of the bowel pokes through into an area near the navel. In adults, factors that can contribute to developing an umbilical hernia include: being overweight or obese straining while moving or lifting heavy objects having a persistent heavy cough having a multiple pregnancy (such as twins or triplets) When is surgery needed? If necessary, umbilical hernias can be treated with surgery to push the bulge back into place and strengthen the weakness in the abdominal wall. This operation may be recommended for your child if the hernia is large or hasn't disappeared by the time they reach four or five years old. You'll usually be advised to wait for your child to reach this age because the operation isn't essential unless there are complications. The risk of your child developing complications is very low. However, surgery is recommended for most adults with an umbilical hernia as the hernia is unlikely to get better by itself when you're older and the risk of complications is higher. Complications that can develop as a result of an umbilical hernia include: obstruction \u2013 where a section of the bowel becomes stuck outside the abdomen, causing nausea, vomiting and pain strangulation \u2013 where a section of bowel becomes trapped and its blood supply is cut off; this requires emergency surgery within hours to release the trapped tissue and restore its blood supply so it doesn't die Surgery will get rid of the hernia and prevent any serious complications, although there's a chance of it returning after the operation. Repairing an umbilical hernia An umbilical hernia repair is a relatively simple procedure that normally takes about 20 to 30 minutes to perform. General anaesthetic is usually used so there's no pain while the operation is carried out. The weak spot in the abdominal wall is usually closed with stitches in children. If the hernia is large or in adults, a special mesh may be used to strengthen the area instead. You or your child should be able to go home the same day the operation is carried out, but you may feel a bit sore and uncomfortable while you recover.  Strenuous activities will need to be limited for a few weeks after the operation, and a week or two off school or work is often advised. Most people are able to return to all their normal activities within a month of surgery. Read more about: how an umbilical hernia repair is performed recovering from an umbilical hernia repair Are there any risks from surgery? Complications from an umbilical hernia repair are uncommon, but can include: the wound becoming infected and needing antibiotics the hernia returning feeling sick and having a headache or numbness in the legs a few hours after the operation The belly button often looks normal after surgery, but there's a chance its appearance may change as a result of the operation.

Symptoms of a herpes simplex eye infection may include: eye redness swelling (inflammation) and pain in or around the eye blurred vision However, some people have an active herpes simplex eye infection without any noticeable symptoms. Herpes simplex eye infections are quite common and usually affect middle-aged people. They affect around 1 to 2 people in every 1,000 in the UK. When to see your GP It's important to see your GP as soon as possible if you have symptoms of a herpes simplex eye infection. An untreated infection can permanently damage your eyes (see complications, below). Your GP will ask about your symptoms and examine your eyes to rule out any other conditions. They may put a harmless yellow dye into your eye to see any irregular areas or injury (fluorescein staining). They may also test your vision using a chart. Eye specialist If your GP thinks you may have a herpes simplex eye infection, they will send you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist), who should see you as quickly as possible. This is because herpes simplex infection is difficult to diagnose without specialist knowledge and equipment. It can also permanently affect your eyesight if not treated quickly. Causes of herpes simplex eye infections Herpes simplex eye infections are eye infections caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which can also cause cold sores on your mouth or face. The herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) usually causes genital herpes and rarely causes eye infections. Nearly everyone is exposed to the virus during childhood. The first time you're infected is known as the \"primary infection\", which doesn't cause any symptoms. The virus stays inactive in the root of a facial nerve. Triggers of a herpes simplex eye infection The virus can be reactivated spontaneously or by certain trigger factors. These include: another illness or feeling run down exposure to strong sunlight having a fever (high temperature above 38C) stress (in women) having your period Having a weakened immune system can also trigger regular cold sores or herpes simplex eye infections \u2013 for example, if you have HIV or are receiving chemotherapy. Treating herpes simplex eye infections Treating a herpes simplex eye infection depends on how severe the infection is and which part of the eye is affected. Most people with a mild herpes simplex eye infection get better in a few weeks, even without treatment. You may be asked to attend regular check-ups to make sure the infection clears up. Eye drops and ointments Your eye specialist may prescribe eye drops or eye ointment that contain either: antiviral medicine a corticosteroid (steroid medication, which reduces inflammation) You may be advised by your eye specialist to take antiviral and steroid eye drops or ointment at the same time. It's important to follow the advice you are given and take any prescribed treatment carefully and for the complete course. Tablets In some cases, antiviral tablets may be prescribed after treatment to stop the infection returning. You may have to keep taking them for up to a year after the infection has gone. Wearing contact lenses It's best not to wear contact lenses until you have finished treatment and the symptoms have completely gone away. Complications of herpes simplex eye infections Complications of herpes simplex eye infections can include: an ulcer on your cornea (the front of your eye) scarring of your cornea \u2013 which can cause vision problems and may require a cornea transplant (an operation to replace the cornea in your eye) further infections caused \u2013 for example, by bacteria or fungi glaucoma (an eye condition that can affect your vision) acute retinal necrosis (ARN) \u2013 extremely rare development that can cause loss of vision in patients with severely compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV If you develop vision problems, this may affect your driving. If this happens, you should contact the DVLA about your vision problem. When are NHS sight tests free?

They're caused by the herpes simplex virus and usually clear up without treatment within 7 to 10 days. You may not have any symptoms when you first become infected with the herpes simplex virus. An outbreak of cold sores may happen some time later. Cold sores often start with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Small fluid-filled sores then appear, usually on the edges of your lower lip. Read more about the symptoms of cold sores. When to visit your GP If you've had outbreaks of cold sores before, it's likely that you'll know what they are if they return. You only need to visit your GP if you're unsure whether it's a cold sore or if it's severe and spreading further than just the lip. See your GP if a cold sore hasn't healed after 7 to 10 days. What causes cold sores? The strain of herpes simplex virus usually responsible for cold sores is known as HSV-1. In rare cases, cold sores can also be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). This can be the result of having oral sex with someone who has genital herpes. Read more about the causes of cold sores. Herpes simplex virus The herpes simplex virus \u2013 or \"cold sore virus\" \u2013 is highly contagious and can be easily passed from person to person by close direct contact. After someone has contracted the virus, it remains inactive (dormant) most of the time. However, every so often the virus can be activated by certain triggers, resulting in an outbreak of cold sores. These triggers vary from person to person, but can include sunlight, fatigue, an injury to the affected area, and, in women, their period. Some people have frequently recurring cold sores around two or three times a year, while others have one cold sore and never have another. Some people never get cold sores at all because the virus never becomes active. Treating cold sores Cold sores usually clear up by themselves without treatment within 7 to 10 days. However, antiviral creams are available over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription. If used correctly, these can help ease your symptoms and speed up the healing time. To be effective, these treatments should be applied as soon as the first signs of a cold sore appear \u2013 when you feel a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Using an antiviral cream after this initial period is unlikely to have much of an effect. Cold sore patches are also available that contain hydrocolloid gel, which is an effective treatment for skin wounds. The patch is placed over the cold sore while it heals. Antiviral tablets may be prescribed for severe cases. Read more about treating cold sores. Complications of cold sores Cold sores are usually mild, but may cause complications in rare cases. People with weak immune systems caused by illness or treatments such as chemotherapy are particularly at risk of complications. Dehydration sometimes occurs if drinking fluids becomes painful. Young children are particularly at risk of becoming dehydrated. The herpes simplex virus can also spread to other parts of your body. Examples of when this can occur include: skin infections \u2013 these often occur if the virus comes into contact with broken skin, such as a cut or graze, or a skin condition such as eczema herpetic whitlow (whitlow finger) \u2013 this causes painful sores and blisters to appear on and around your fingers herpetic keratoconjunctivitis \u2013 this causes swelling and irritation (inflammation) of your eye area and sores to develop on your eyelids Left untreated, herpetic keratoconjunctivitis can cause the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of your eye, to become infected, which can eventually lead to blindness. It's therefore important not to touch your eyes if you have an unhealed cold sore. If you must touch your eyes \u2013 for example, to remove contact lenses \u2013 wash your hands thoroughly first. In very rare cases, encephalitis, a condition where the brain becomes inflamed and swollen, can be caused by the cold sore virus spreading to the brain. It can be treated with intravenous injections of antiviral medications, such as aciclovir. Preventing infection It's not possible to prevent infection with the herpes simplex virus or prevent outbreaks of cold sores, but you can take steps to minimise the spread of infection. Cold sores are at their most contagious when they burst (rupture), but remain contagious until they're completely healed. Avoid close contact with others until your cold sore has completely healed and disappeared. However, there's no need to stay away from work or miss school if you or your child have a cold sore. You can help minimise the risk of the cold sore virus spreading and cold sores recurring by following the advice below: avoid touching cold sores unless you're applying cold sore cream \u2013 creams should be dabbed on gently rather than rubbed in, as this can damage your skin further always wash your hands before and after applying cold sore cream and after touching the affected area don't share cold sore creams or medication with other people as this can cause the infection to spread don't share items that come into contact with the affected area, such as lipsticks or cutlery avoid kissing and oral sex until your cold sores have completely healed be particularly careful around newborn babies, pregnant women and people with a low immune system, such as those with HIV or those having chemotherapy if you know what usually triggers your cold sores, try to avoid the triggers \u2013 for example, a sun block lip balm (SPF 15 or higher) may help prevent cold sores triggered by bright sunlight Page last reviewed: 25\/04\/2016 Next review due: 25\/04\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It causes a rash of red, itchy spots that turn into fluid-filled blisters. They then crust over to form scabs, which eventually drop off. Some children have only a few spots, but other children can have spots that cover their entire body. These are most likely to appear on the face, ears and scalp, under the arms, on the chest and belly, and on the arms and legs. Read more about the symptoms of chickenpox and watch a slideshow of common childhood conditions to help you recognise if your child has it. Chickenpox (known medically as varicella) is caused by a virus called the varicella-zoster virus. It's spread quickly and easily from someone who is infected. Read more about the causes of chickenpox. Chickenpox is most common in children under the age of 10. In fact, chickenpox is so common in childhood that over 90% of adults are immune to the condition because they've had it before. Children usually catch chickenpox in winter and spring, particularly between March and May. What to do To prevent spreading the infection, keep children off nursery or school until all their spots have crusted over. Chickenpox is infectious from one to two days before the rash starts, until all the blisters have crusted over (usually five to six days after the start of the rash). If your child has chickenpox, try to keep them away from public areas to avoid contact with people who may not have had it, especially people who are at risk of serious problems, such as newborn babies, pregnant women and anyone with a weakened immune system (for example, people having cancer treatment or taking steroid tablets). Read more about what you need to do to stop chickenpox spreading. Chickenpox treatment Chickenpox in children is considered a mild illness, but your child will probably feel pretty miserable and irritable while they have it. Your child may have a fever for the first few days of the illness. The spots can be incredibly itchy. There is no specific treatment for chickenpox, but there are pharmacy remedies that can alleviate symptoms. These include paracetamol to relieve fever, and calamine lotion and cooling gels to ease itching. In most children, the blisters crust up and fall off naturally within one to two weeks. Read more about chickenpox treatments. When to see a doctor For most children, chickenpox is a mild illness that gets better on its own. However, some children can become more seriously ill with chickenpox and need to see a doctor. Contact your GP straight away if your child develops any abnormal symptoms, such as: if the blisters on their skin become infected  if your child has a pain in their chest or has difficulty breathing Chickenpox in adults Chickenpox may be a childhood illness, but adults can get it too. Chickenpox tends to be more severe in adults than children, and adults have a higher risk of developing complications. Adults with chickenpox should stay off work until all the spots have crusted over. They should seek medical advice if they develop any abnormal symptoms, such as infected blisters. Adults with chickenpox may benefit from taking antiviral medicine if treatment is started early in the course of the illness. Read more about antivirals in the treatment of chickenpox. Who's at special risk? Some children and adults are at special risk of serious problems if they catch chickenpox. They include: pregnant women newborn babies people with a weakened immune system These people should seek medical advice as soon as they are exposed to the chickenpox virus or they develop chickenpox symptoms. They may need a blood test to check if they are protected from (immune to) chickenpox. Read more about immunity testing and the diagnosis of chickenpox in people at special risk. Chickenpox in pregnancy Chickenpox occurs in approximately 3 in every 1,000 pregnancies. It can cause serious complications for both the pregnant woman and her baby. See complications of chickenpox for further information on what to do if you are exposed to chickenpox during pregnancy. Chickenpox and shingles Once you have had chickenpox, you usually develop antibodies to the infection and become immune to catching it again. However, the virus that causes chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus, remains inactive (dormant) in your body's nerve tissues and can return later in life as an illness called shingles. It's possible to catch chickenpox from someone with shingles, but not the other way around. Read more about shingles. Is there a vaccine against chickenpox? There is a chickenpox vaccine, but it is not part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule. The vaccine is only offered to children and adults who are particularly vulnerable to chickenpox complications. The recommended two doses of the vaccine is estimated to offer 98% protection from chickenpox in children and 75% protection in adolescents and adults. So it may be possible to develop the infection after vaccination. Similarly, there is a chance that someone who has received the vaccine could develop chickenpox after coming in close contact with a person who has shingles. Read more about the chickenpox vaccine and why children in the UK aren't routinely vaccinated against chickenpox. Common questions about chickenpox answered How do you catch chickenpox?

It causes painful blisters on the genitals and the surrounding areas. As genital herpes can be passed to others through intimate sexual contact, it's often referred to as a sexually transmitted infection (STI). HSV can affect any mucous membrane (moist lining), such as those found in the mouth (cold sores). Genital herpes is a chronic (long-term) condition. The virus remains in your body and can become active again. The average rate of recurrence is four to five times in the first two years after being infected. However, over time, it tends to become active less frequently and each outbreak becomes less severe. Read more about the symptoms of genital herpes. The herpes simplex virus (HSV) There are two types of herpes simplex virus (HSV), type 1 and type 2. Both types are highly contagious and can be passed easily from one person to another by direct contact. Genital herpes is usually transmitted by having sex (vaginal, anal or oral) with an infected person. Even if someone with genital herpes doesn't have any symptoms, it's possible for them to pass the condition on to a sexual partner. At least eight out of 10 people who carry the virus are unaware they have been infected because there are often few or no initial symptoms. However, certain triggers can activate the virus, causing an outbreak of genital herpes. Read more about the causes of genital herpes. Who is affected? Genital herpes is a common condition, especially in people from 20 to 24 years old. In 2013, 32,279 people attended a sexual health clinic in England with an attack of genital herpes for the first time. Read more about how genital herpes is diagnosed. Treating genital herpes Although there's no cure for genital herpes, the symptoms can usually be controlled using antiviral medicines. However, it's important to prevent the spread of genital herpes by avoiding sex until symptoms have cleared up and continuing to use a condom afterwards. Read more about how genital herpes is treated. Pregnancy Genital herpes can cause problems during pregnancy. These complications can be more serious depending on whether you already have genital herpes, or develop it for the first time while pregnant. Read more about complications of genital herpes.

It's caused by the herpes simplex virus, a highly contagious virus that can cause cold sores and genital ulcers in adults. Herpes can be very serious for a young baby, whose immune system won't have fully developed to fight off the virus. Thankfully, neonatal herpes is rare in the UK and can be prevented by following some simple advice. How does a newborn baby catch herpes? During pregnancy and labour A newborn baby is at risk of catching herpes if the mother had genital herpes for the first time within the last six weeks of her pregnancy. There's a risk the mother will have passed the infection on to her baby if she had a vaginal delivery.  This risk is much lower if the mother has had previous episodes of genital herpes. Learn more about the risks of genital herpes and pregnancy. After birth The herpes simplex virus can also be passed on to a newborn baby if: a person has a cold sore and kisses the baby the mother breastfeeds her baby with herpes sores on her breast (which can develop after touching her cold sore and then her breast) Cold sores are at their most contagious when they burst (rupture), they remain contagious until completely healed. What are the warning signs in babies? Because newborn babies have under-developed immune systems, they can quickly become seriously ill after catching the virus. A newborn baby infected with herpes may: become listless (lacking in energy) and sleepy stop feeding be floppy have a fever (read how to take your baby's temperature) have a high-pitched cry have breathing difficulties or start grunting breath rapidly have a blue tongue and skin (cyanosis) have a rash The baby's health can deteriorate quickly if the virus spreads to their brain or other parts of their body. What should you do if you think your baby has it? Contact your GP or midwife as soon as possible if your baby has any of the above symptoms and you're worried. You may be advised to take your baby to A&E. Find your nearest A&E. Neonatal herpes is usually treated with antiviral drugs given directly into the baby's vein (intravenously). This treatment may be needed for several weeks. Any related complications, such as seizures, will also need to be treated. The baby can be breastfed while receiving treatment, unless the mother has herpes sores around her nipples. If the mother is taking antiviral treatment too, this can be excreted in her breast milk but is not thought to cause any harm to the baby. How serious is herpes for a baby? Sometimes neonatal herpes will only affect the baby's eyes, mouth or skin. In these cases, most babies will make a complete recovery with antiviral treatment. However, the condition is much more serious if it has spread to the baby's organs. Nearly a third of infants with this type of neonatal herpes will die, even after they've been treated. If widespread herpes is not immediately treated, there's a high chance the baby will die.  How can neonatal herpes be prevented? If you're pregnant and have a history of genital herpes, tell your doctor or midwife. You may need to take medication during the last month of pregnancy to prevent an outbreak of vaginal sores during labour. Delivery by caesarean section is recommended if the genital herpes has occurred for the first time in the last six weeks of your pregnancy.  If you develop a cold sore, or think you're coming down with a herpes infection, take these precautions: don't kiss any babies wash your hands before contact with a baby wash your hands before breastfeeding and cover up any cold sores, to avoid accidentally touching your mouth and then breast (this is enough to transfer the virus) Support and advice if you\u2019ve been affected You may find these resources helpful: World Health Organization (WHO) factsheet: herpes simplex virus NHS: cold sores NHS: genital herpes Sands (stillbirth neonatal death charity)   Page last reviewed: 14\/08\/2015 Next review due: 14\/08\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It usually affects the fleshy area of the fingertip. What are the symptoms? The fingertip suddenly becomes red, swollen and extremely painful. Small white blisters develop underneath the skin of the finger, which may break to release fluid, eventually crusting over. What's the cause? There are two types of herpes simplex virus (HSV), type 1 and type 2. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause a herpetic whitlow. These viruses can also cause cold sores and genital herpes. A herpetic whitlow can develop as a secondary infection if you already have a cold sore or genital herpes and you touch the sore area of skin, transferring the virus from your mouth or genitals to your finger. It can also develop if you touch the sore or blister of another infected person.  You're at greater risk of becoming infected if you have a weakened immune system. How is it treated? Antivirals A herpetic whitlow may be treated with an antiviral drug such as aciclovir. You may be prescribed a five or seven day course of 200mg aciclovir to take five times a day or 400mg to take three times a day. But this is only worth taking if you start the treatment within 48 hours of symptoms starting. Using an antiviral after this initial period is unlikely to have any effect. Antiviral drugs may help to heal a herpetic whitlow, but they do not get rid of the herpes simplex virus or prevent future outbreaks of herpes simplex viral infection. A whitlow will heal without an antiviral drug within two to three weeks. Antiviral treatment may: reduce the time taken for the abscess to heal reduce your risk of a secondary bacterial infection reduce your risk of the herpes simplex virus spreading to other parts of the body Caring for the whitlow at home You should cover the whitlow with a light dressing so the infection doesn't spread any further. Avoid wearing contact lenses until the infection has healed, to stop the virus spreading to your eyes. You can take an over-the-counter painkiller such as paracetamol or ibuprofen for pain relief. Do not attempt to drain the fluid, as this may cause the virus to spread or cause a bacterial infection. Will it come back? The herpes virus remains dormant (inactive) in nerve cells and may reactivate at a later date, sometimes following stress or an illness. This can result in another whitlow at the same site as the first one If a whitlow does return, it can be treated in the same way, with an antiviral drug. If the whitlow returns often, the antiviral drug can be given for long periods of time (years) to reduce the number of times it comes back. This suppressive antiviral treatment will also reduce both the severity of the whitlow and the length of time it takes to heal.

It's sometimes spelt hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and is also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. Typical symptoms are persistent nosebleeds and visible red spots in certain places on the body \u2013 typically on the fingertip pads, on the lips and tongue, and on mucous membranes such as the lining of the nose and gut (see What are the symptoms?). It affects about 1 in 5,000 people. What happens in HHT? In HHT, some of the blood vessels do not develop properly. Normally, the arteries branch off into smaller and smaller blood vessels until they reach a network of capillaries (tiny blood vessels) that feed the body tissues and organs. Blood pressure drops in this network of capillaries, before the blood flows on into veins and back to the heart. In HHT, some of the blood vessels from the arteries join directly with the veins. These abnormal connections are called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). When AVMs occur in small vessels near the surface of the skin, where they are visible as red spots, they are known as telangiectasia. When they form in the lining of the nose or the gut, they can easily bleed. Frequent bleeding can lead to anaemia, and sometimes more serious problems (see What are the symptoms?). What causes HHT?  Someone with HHT will have a faulty gene (genetic mutation) and, usually, this will have been inherited from one of their parents. This gene normally provides instructions for making certain proteins found in the lining of the blood vessels. In HHT, the gene cannot produce this protein, or the protein it produces is abnormal. You only need to have one copy of the faulty gene to develop HHT. What are the symptoms? Symptoms usually start in childhood or in the teenage years. Nosebleeds Often, the first sign is developing nosebleeds. They can start at any age, often in childhood. Nosebleeds may be frequent and persistent, but can improve with age. They happen because of the abnormal blood vessels in the lining of the nose. The loss of blood can lead to iron-deficiency anaemia, if the iron is not replaced through the diet and with iron supplements. Red or purple spots under the skin (telangiectasia) From about 20-30 years old (sometimes earlier), abnormal blood vessels \u2013 telangiectasia \u2013 may start to appear just underneath the skin, which show as red or purple spots. Telangiectasia typically form on the fingertip pads, the lips, and the lining of the nose or the gut. Sometimes, they can form on the ears and face. They tend to increase in number with age. They're usually just a cosmetic problem, although they may sometimes bleed. Abnormal blood vessels (AVMs) inside the body  Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can form inside the body organs and tissues. Many people with AVMs won't experience any symptoms, and are not even aware they have them. They can cause preventable complications, but most people live well with their AVMs. Decisions to treat AVMs are based on the safety of the treatment versus the risks of leaving the AVM untreated. Some AVMs are worth treating, and some are better left alone. AVMs in the lungs (pulmonary AVMs) often lead to low blood oxygen levels, and can allow blood clots to pass through to the brain, which could result in a stroke. They can occasionally bleed, but this is not very common outside of pregnancy. There are safe treatments available and these are usually recommended when pulmonary AVMs are found. AVMs in the brain usually cause no symptoms, although they can irritate the surrounding brain tissue and cause seizures or headaches. They can also bleed, leading to a stroke, but whether they should be treated if they have not bled remains controversial. AVMs in other parts of the body usually cause no symptoms. How is HHT treated? There's no cure for HHT, but there are effective treatments and life expectancy is usually very good. Some patients can be managed by their GP, and some will need to be under the care of a specialist. Because there are increased risks during pregnancy for women with HHT (such as a slight increased risk of a major bleed or a stroke), it is recommended that if HHT is in the family, this is brought to the attention of the specialist in charge of the woman's care. Iron supplements Patients who have regular nosebleeds will probably lose a lot of iron through this loss of blood, especially if they also bleed from telangiectasia in the gut. It is important to replace the lost iron with iron supplements \u2013 dietary changes alone may not be enough. Read about the importance of iron and the treatment of anaemia with iron supplements and iron-rich food. Treatment of nosebleeds Those with severe nosebleeds may need emergency nasal packing, where the nose is packed with ribbon gauze or a special nasal sponge.  Some people may need to see an ear, nose and throat specialist for treatment. Laser therapy may help (see below). More severe cases may respond to skin grafting or other surgery. Blood transfusion after loss of blood If a lot of blood has been lost from bleeding inside the body or after nosebleeds, a blood transfusion may be needed. Read about blood transfusions. Laser treatment for telangiectasia Telangiectasia on the skin or in the lining of the nose can sometimes be improved with vascular laser or intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment. For the skin, a referral to a dermatologist is usually needed. Around two to four treatments a year may be needed, so the overall cost may be significant if the treatment is not available on the NHS. For the nose, a referral to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist is needed, and these treatments are usually available on the NHS. Laser and IPL machines produce narrow beams of light aimed at the visible blood vessels in the skin. The heat from the lasers damages the dilated veins and causes them to shrink so they are no longer visible, with minimal scarring or damage to the surrounding area. Laser treatment can cause pain, but most people do not need an anaesthetic. Treating AVMs inside the body AVMs in the body may require specialist treatment. Your HHT specialist will explain any procedures to you in more detail. For example, AVMs in the lung are usually treated, even if they are not causing any apparent problems. They are treated by embolisation, a procedure that blocks the blood supply to the AVM. A tiny plug is inserted inside the artery supplying the abnormal blood vessel. Embolisation has virtually replaced open surgery, and is normally carried out under sedation (which will help relax you during the procedure). For brain AVMs, embolisation, surgery and stereotactic radiotherapy (precisely delivering radiation to the blood vessel) are possible treatment options. Liver AVMs may require different types of specialist treatments. However, these treatments aren't always appropriate. Your specialist will explain why many AVMs, such as those in the liver and in the brain, may be better left alone, as the risks of invasive treatments may outweigh the potential benefits. Information about you If you have HHT, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

The diaphragm is a large, thin sheet of muscle between the chest and the abdomen (tummy). Hiatus hernia and heartburn A hiatus hernia itself rarely has any noticeable symptoms. However, it can cause a problem called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). GORD is where stomach acid leaks into the oesophagus (the tube that carries food to the stomach). It can occur if a hiatus hernia prevents the valve at the bottom of the oesophagus from working properly. Your oesophagus can become severely irritated, because it's not protected against stomach acid. This can cause symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, an unpleasant sour taste in your mouth, and swallowing problems (dysphagia). You should see your GP if you have frequent and severe symptoms of GORD. What causes a hiatus hernia? It's not exactly clear what causes hiatus hernia, but it may be the result of the diaphragm becoming weak with age, or pressure on the abdomen. Hiatus hernia can sometimes occur in newborn babies if the stomach or diaphragm doesn't develop properly. Who's affected Hiatus hernia can affect anyone, but it's more common in people who are: over 50 years of age overweight pregnant It's estimated that a third of people over 50 have a hiatus hernia. There's also a rare type of hiatus hernia that affects newborn babies, which is caused by a congenital defect of the stomach or diaphragm. Congenital means that it is present from birth. Types of hiatus hernia There are two main types of hiatus hernia. They are: sliding hiatus hernias \u2013 hernias that move up and down, in and out of the chest area (more than 80% of hiatus hernias are of this type) para-oesophageal hiatus hernias \u2013 also called rolling hiatus hernias, where part of the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus (about 5-15% of hiatus hernias are of this type) These pages mainly focus on sliding hiatus hernias. They can usually be diagnosed using an X-ray or an endoscopy, where a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end is used to examine the inside of the body. Read more about diagnosing a hiatus hernia. Treating a hiatus hernia Treatment for a sliding hiatus hernia usually focuses on relieving the symptoms of GORD, such as heartburn. Lifestyle changes and medication are the preferred treatments. Surgery is usually only recommended as an alternative to long-term medication or if other treatments haven't worked. Lifestyle advice may include: eating smaller, more frequent meals, rather than three large meals a day avoiding lying down (including going to bed) for three hours after eating or drinking removing any foods or drinks from your diet that make your symptoms worse   If a hiatus hernia isn't causing any noticeable problems, it doesn't usually need to be treated. Surgery is used to repair a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia if there's a risk of serious complications. Read more about treating a hiatus hernia. Further problems It's rare for a hiatus hernia to cause complications, but long-term damage to the oesophagus caused by leaking stomach acid can lead to ulcers, scarring and changes to the cells of the oesophagus, which can increase your risk of oesophageal cancer.

Hib and meningitis C infections are serious and potentially fatal. They can both cause meningitis and septicaemia (blood poisoning). Who should have the Hib\/Men C vaccine? The Hib\/Men C vaccine is offered to all babies when they are one-year-old as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. Read more about when your baby should have the Hib\/Men C vaccine. Why is the Hib\/Men C vaccine needed? The vaccine boosts the protection your baby has already gained from their first course of Hib vaccine which they received in the 5-in-1 vaccine at 8, 12 and 16 weeks old, and begins their protection against meningitis C.  How safe is the Hib\/Men C vaccine? The Hib\/Men C vaccine is very safe. It's inactivated which means it doesn't contain any live organisms so there is no risk of your baby catching the diseases against which it protects. The vaccine also has few side effects. The brand name of the Hib\/Men C vaccine given in the UK is Menitorix. Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for Menitorix (PDF, 104kb). Read more about the Hib\/Men C vaccine side effects. How effective is the Hib\/Men C vaccine? The Hib\/Men C booster is highly effective and protects children when they are most vulnerable to these diseases. Rates of Hib and Men C disease in the UK are now at their lowest-ever levels as a result of vaccination. How does the Hib\/Men C vaccine work? The Hib\/Men C vaccine contains bits of the bacteria that cause the diseases it protects against. If your child comes into contact with these germs, the antibodies their body produces after vaccination will fight the infection to stop the disease taking hold. Read answers to parents' common questions about the Hib\/Men C vaccine. Page last reviewed: 18\/04\/2016 Next review due: 18\/04\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

This timetable has been worked out to give children the best chance of developing immunity against common, but potentially deadly, diseases. When to start childhood vaccinations Routine childhood vaccinations start when a baby is eight weeks old. This is a good age to start vaccinations, because the natural immunity to illness that newborn babies get from their mother is beginning to wear off. If a vaccine is given before eight weeks of age, the baby\u2019s natural immunity to disease may stop it from working. That's why you should ideally have your child vaccinated at the recommended time. Any delay can leave your baby unprotected against illnesses that are often more common and worse in younger children. Vaccinations for premature babies Babies who are born early can have a greater risk of catching infections than babies born on time. This is because their immune systems are less developed and they don\u2019t receive as much natural immunity from their mothers. It\u2019s especially important that premature babies get their vaccines on time, from eight weeks after birth, no matter how premature they are. It may seem very early to give a vaccination to such a tiny baby, but many scientific studies have shown that it\u2019s a good time to give them vaccines. Postponing vaccination until they're older leaves them vulnerable to diseases. If your baby was born very prematurely (before 26 weeks of pregnancy), they may still be in hospital when their first vaccinations are due. In this case, your baby will receive their first vaccines in hospital. Read this NHS leaflet on vaccinations for premature babies (PDF, 221kb). Booster jabs Some vaccines are given more than once. A gap is left between these vaccine doses to make sure that each one has time to work properly. However, the recommended gap is only a minimum. If the gap is longer \u2013 because you missed an appointment, for example \u2013 you don\u2019t have to start the course again. Vaccination timings The NHS childhood vaccination schedule tells you when each routine vaccination should be given. It normally starts when your baby is eight weeks old and is completed by the time they're 18. Other non-routine vaccines may be needed throughout childhood, such as travel vaccines or vaccines for children with certain medical conditions.

The diaphragm is a thin membrane of muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen (tummy). It is located underneath the ribcage and helps to control breathing. The medical name for hiccups is \"singultus\". What causes hiccups? Hiccups are very common and most people will get them at some point during their life. They can affect people of any age, including babies. Hiccups often occur without any obvious trigger, although short episodes have been linked with: drinking alcohol  smoking having a bloated stomach eating too quickly or eating spicy foods drinking hot or fizzy drinks emotions, such as stress, fear or excitement In rare cases, hiccups can last for a long time. If hiccups last for more than 48 hours they are known as \"persistent\" or \"protracted\" hiccups, and hiccups that last longer than a month are called \"intractable\" hiccups. These longer-lasting hiccups have been linked with a number of underlying medical conditions and some medications. Read more about the causes of hiccups. When to seek medical advice Hiccups are not usually serious and in most cases only last a few minutes. However, you should see your GP if you have hiccups that recur frequently or last longer than 48 hours so they can try to identify a possible cause and determine whether any further investigation or treatment is necessary. How hiccups are treated Most hiccups will pass quickly and won't need any specific treatment. If your hiccups are troublesome, there are some things you can do that may help, such as: sipping ice-cold water holding your breath for a short period biting on a lemon swallowing granulated sugar tasting vinegar pulling your knees up to your chest For longer-lasting hiccups, identifying and treating any identifiable cause may help, and there are also a number of medications that are sometimes used specifically to control hiccups.

It's not known exactly what causes hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), but the disease is linked to inflamed sweat glands and plugging of the hair follicles. An estimated 1% of the population has HS \u2013 but this may be an underestimate, as some people might be too embarrassed to seek diagnosis and treatment. What are the symptoms? HS ranges from mild to severe. It causes a mixture of red boil-like lumps, blackheads, cysts, scarring and channels in the skin that leak pus. These lumps and spots are found around the groin and armpits, and sometimes under the breasts and in other areas (see below).  HS may sometimes be mistaken for acne, folliculitis (inflammation of the hair follicles) or a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as herpes. Some of the lumps may become infected with bacteria, causing a secondary infection that will require antibiotics to treat. HS is very painful. The disease tends to start with a firm pea-sized lesion developing in one place. This either goes away on its own or ruptures after a few hours or days, to ooze pus. Often, new lumps will soon appear in an area nearby. If these are not controlled with medication, larger lumps may form and spread. Narrow channels also form under the skin that break out on the surface and leak pus. These are called sinus tracts. HS is a lifelong, recurring condition that requires constant management (see the Outlook section below). Stages of the disease Doctors classify the disease into three distinct stages: Stage 1 \u2013 single or a few isolated abscesses without scarring or sinus tracts. Stage 2 \u2013 recurrent abscesses in more than one area and the beginning of the formation of sinus tracts. Stage 3 \u2013 widespread abscesses with many interconnected sinus tracts under the skin. There may be severe scarring and continuous leaking. Main affected areas HS usually affects skin in the following areas: around the groin and genitals in the armpits around the bottom (anus) on the buttocks and inner thighs below the breasts The abscesses may spread to the nape of the neck, waistband and inner thighs. Other isolated areas have been known, including the front or back of the legs, the sides, the back area and even the face. Many people with HS develop a pilonidal sinus, which is a small hole or \"tunnel\" in the skin, usually at the top of the buttocks, where the buttocks separate.  What are the causes? The exact cause of HS is unclear, but the bumps and spots appear to be the result of blocked sweat glands and hair follicles. However, the disease is not infectious and is not linked to poor hygiene. It is thought that HS may be caused by a problem with the immune system. According to the British Association of Dermatologists, it may be linked to Crohn's disease. Many HS patients also suffer from another underlying autoimmune disorder (where the immune system attacks the body's own cells and tissues). Who is affected? HS usually starts around the age of puberty, but it can appear at any age. It is less common for HS to occur before puberty or after the menopause, leading some experts to believe that the sex hormones have some sort of influence on the disease. In around a third of cases, HS runs in families. HS also affects more women than men, for reasons that are unclear. Many people with HS: are smokers are overweight also have hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and\/or acne, both of which are linked to levels of sex hormones  Smoking and being obese are likely to make the condition worse. How is it treated? HS can be difficult to manage and there is no cure. The aim is to catch the disease in its early stages and prevent it getting worse. Therefore, an early diagnosis is important. In the early stages, the disease may be controlled with medication. Persistent and severe cases may require surgery. These treatments are outlined below. Antibiotics If your lumps are particularly painful, red and oozing pus, your GP or specialist may prescribe a two-week course of antibiotic tablets, as there may be a secondary infection present. If there is no suspected bacterial infection, antibiotics are used as suppressive treatment. This involves a course of antibiotics, usually lasting up to three months, with the aim of remission (a symptom-free period). You may be prescribed a topical antibiotic cream, such as clindamycin 1%, to use twice daily. Oral antibiotics include erythromycin, tetracycline, lymecycline, doxycycline or clindamycin, alongside a number of other options. Antiseptics Antiseptic washes such as 4% chlorhexidine wash are frequently prescribed alongside other treatments. Antiseptics are usually applied all over the body, except the head and neck, then washed off after a few minutes. Retinoids Retinoids are vitamin-A based drugs such as isotretinoin. They are not as effective for treating HS as they are for acne, but a course for 6 to 12 months may help to control some of the spots and lumps. Isotretinoin should be used with caution, with the advice of a specialist. It cannot be taken during pregnancy, and possible side effects include dry lips, skin and eyes.  Contraceptive pill Women whose HS flares up before their period may benefit from taking the contraceptive pill for 12 months or more. The pill contains an artificial version of oestrogen, which should help reduce secretions from the sweat glands and control the lumps. Immunosuppressive treatments Severe cases of HS may require treatments that suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids, ciclosporin and biological drugs. Corticosteroids You may be prescribed steroid medicine (corticosteroids) such as prednisolone to reduce severely inflamed skin. Corticosteroids can be taken as tablets, or you may have an injection of the drug directly into your affected skin. Possible side effects of corticosteroids are fluid retention, weight gain, constipation and mood swings.  Find out more about the side effects of corticosteroids. Ciclosporin  Ciclosporin is a powerful medication that suppresses the immune system. For some patients with HS, it can relieve symptoms for a few months. However, this medicine can cause vomiting, diarrhoea, high blood pressure, numbness, and kidney and liver problems.  Infliximab and adalimumab Biological drugs like infliximab or adalimumab, which also suppress the immune system, may be prescribed for severe cases of HS. Your dermatologist will usually only prescribe them if other treatments don't work. Infliximab and adalimumab are given by injection at a hospital or clinic. You may need to have the injections at regular intervals. Possible side effects include blood disorders, infection and cancer of an organ. Speak to your doctor about these side effects if you are considering taking this medication. Surgery A surgical procedure may be considered if your HS is not controlled with medication, or suddenly becomes worse. If you have some very large lumps that will not clear with antibiotics, you may be offered one of the following treatments: incision and drainage or removal \u2013 cutting off the lids of the lumps, and draining or scraping out the contents inside, or removing the lumps altogether laser ablation \u2013 using a laser to remove the lumps (this has no proven benefit and is an experimental treatment) cryotherapy \u2013 freezing off the lumps with liquid nitrogen Outlook HS persists for many years and there is no cure, but symptoms may be improved with treatment if it is diagnosed early. Not all people with HS progress to stage 3 \u2013 the disease can be controlled so it doesn't progress beyond stage 1. However, HS can affect your life in many ways. Routinely changing dressings and living with the pain, discomfort and embarrassment of the symptoms can affect quality of life and lead to stress, anxiety and depression. If you are having problems coping, speak to your health professional or a charity to see what support is available.  Read about how to find mental health support. Lifestyle tips for people with HS lose any excess weight stop smoking, if you smoke manage stress, as this can worsen your symptoms use an antiseptic skin wash or antiseptic soap \u2013 this may be prescribed alongside other treatment hold a warmed flannel to the spots to encourage the pus to drain wear loose-fitting clothes avoid shaving the skin and wearing perfume or perfumed deodorants in the affected areas Many people with HS benefit from joining a local support group \u2013 ask your doctor for details of your nearest one, or contact The Hidradenitis Suppurativa Trust.

She explains how she lowered her blood pressure through healthy living changes. 'Your choices can make a difference. I intend to stay alive as long as possible, so I'll do whatever it takes to stay here'  \"When the nurse told me I had high blood pressure it was a shock. I felt healthy, and was having a check-up for my asthma and weight. I knew I was overweight (I could have beaten Frank Bruno when he was still boxing), but because I'm 5ft 9in tall, I didn't seem too big. I've never smoked and only drink occasionally. High blood pressure risks \"I can't remember exactly what my blood pressure was that day, but it was extremely high. The lower number was nearly in triple digits, even though it's supposed to be around 80. \"I knew there was high blood pressure on both sides of my family. My aunts, uncles and cousins have it, and I was aware that I'd have to take tablets if it got too high. \"Once you start taking the tablets, you have to take them for the rest of your life, and I didn't want that. I also knew that high blood pressure increases your risk of having a stroke. \"I was determined to bring the pressure down by being more healthy. If you've got high blood pressure, you don't know your limit until you have a stroke, so you've got to take action as soon as possible.\" 'I was surprised to find there's salt in things like cornflakes and bread'  Cutting down on salt \"The nurse advised me to eat in moderation, eat less salt and get more exercise. I started reading food labels for salt content, but it was a challenge. \"I was so used to eating certain types of food, such as chocolate or a Sunday roast, but suddenly I was constantly thinking about how many grams of salt my food contained and how it would affect my health. \"I was surprised to find there's salt in things like cornflakes and bread. I wondered what I could eat besides fruit! Luckily, I love eating fruit. Home cooking \"Cutting down on salt at home wasn't hard, especially if you're creative with seasonings and spices. I've never had salt on the table, because in Caribbean cooking we usually use salt in a marinade or for seasoning meat. \"I just had to cook more creatively so that I wouldn't need to rely on salt. I love to cook and make all my meals from scratch. That way, you know which ingredients are used, and their quantity. \"About three months after my diagnosis, I joined a weight management programme, which I've been on for 15 months. At my heaviest, I was around 117kg (258lbs), and I've lost around 8kg. It isn't as much as I'd like, but I'm getting there.\" Walking every day \"For exercise, I walk every day. All you need is a pair of comfortable shoes. I put on my headphones, always making sure I can hear what's happening around me to be safe. \"I run a breakfast club for school children, and I walk one mile to work, then a mile and a half to the shops and local library.  \"My blood pressure is checked every month. Two months ago it was 138\/80, but last time I was checked it had risen to 160\/90. I'd been eating a few sausage and egg muffins, so I need to avoid them completely. \"The nurse also measures my waist, because if a woman's waist is over 31.5 inches (80cm) she is more likely to get diabetes. I haven't got diabetes, but being overweight increases your risk. \"In your mid-40s it's hard to change your diet, but it's possible. Your choices can really make a difference.

It's a common problem for people with diabetes. It can affect people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, as well as pregnant women with gestational diabetes. It can occasionally affect people who don't have diabetes, but usually only people who are seriously ill, such as those who have recently had a stroke or heart attack, or have a severe infection. Hyperglycaemia shouldn't be confused with hypoglycaemia, which is when a person's blood sugar level drops too low. This information focuses on hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes. Is hyperglycaemia serious? The aim of diabetes treatment is to keep blood sugar levels as near to normal as possible. But if you have diabetes, no matter how careful you are, you're likely to experience hyperglycaemia at some point. It's important to be able to recognise and treat hyperglycaemia, as it can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. Occasional mild episodes aren't usually a cause for concern and can be treated quite easily or may return to normal on their own. However, hyperglycaemia can be potentially dangerous if blood sugar levels become very high or stay high for long periods. Very high blood sugar levels can cause life-threatening complications, such as: diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) \u2013 a condition caused by the body needing to break down fat as a source of energy, which can lead to a diabetic coma; this tends to affect people with type 1 diabetes hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) \u2013 severe dehydration caused by the body trying to get rid of excess sugar; this tends to affect people with type 2 diabetes Regularly having high blood sugar levels for long periods of time (over months or years) can result in permanent damage to parts of the body such as the eyes, nerves, kidneys and blood vessels. If you experience hyperglycaemia regularly, speak to your doctor or diabetes care team. You may need to change your treatment or lifestyle to keep your blood sugar levels within a healthy range. Symptoms of hyperglycaemia Symptoms of hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes tend to develop slowly over a few days or weeks. In some cases, there may be no symptoms until the blood sugar level is very high. Symptoms of hyperglycaemia include: increased thirst and a dry mouth needing to pee frequently tiredness blurred vision unintentional weight loss recurrent infections, such as thrush, bladder infections (cystitis) and skin infections Symptoms of hyperglycaemia can also be due to undiagnosed diabetes, so see your GP if this applies to you. You can have a test to check for the condition. What should my blood sugar level be? When you're first diagnosed with diabetes, your diabetes care team will usually tell you what your blood sugar level is and what you should aim to get it down to. You may be advised to use a testing device to monitor your blood sugar level regularly at home, or you may have an appointment with a nurse or doctor every few months to see what your level is. Target blood sugar levels differ for everyone, but generally speaking: if you monitor yourself at home \u2013 a normal target is 4-7mmol\/l before eating and under 8.5-9mmol\/l two hours after a meal if you're tested every few months \u2013 a normal target is below 48mmol\/mol (or 6.5% on the older measurement scale) What causes high blood sugar? A variety of things can trigger an increase in blood sugar level in people with diabetes, including: stress an illness, such as a cold eating too much, such as snacking between meals a lack of exercise  dehydration missing a dose of your diabetes medication, or taking an incorrect dose over-treating an episode of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) taking certain medicines, such as steroid medication Occasional episodes of hyperglycaemia can also occur in children and young adults during growth spurts. Treating hyperglycaemia If you've been diagnosed with diabetes and you have symptoms of hyperglycaemia, follow the advice your care team has given you to reduce your blood sugar level. If you're not sure what to do, contact your GP or care team. You may be advised to: change your diet \u2013 for example, you may be advised to avoid foods that cause your blood sugar levels to rise, such as cakes or sugary drinks drink plenty of sugar-free fluids \u2013 this can help if you're dehydrated exercise more often \u2013 gentle, regular exercise such as walking can often lower your blood sugar level, particularly if it helps you lose weight if you use insulin, adjust your dose \u2013 your care team can give you specific advice about how to do this You may also be advised to monitor your blood sugar level more closely, or test your blood or urine for substances called ketones (associated with diabetic ketoacidosis). Until your blood sugar level is back under control, watch out for additional symptoms that could be a sign of a more serious condition (see below). When to get urgent medical attention Contact your diabetes care team immediately if you have a high blood sugar level and experience the following symptoms: feeling or being sick abdominal (tummy) pain  rapid, deep breathing signs of dehydration, such as a headache, dry skin and a weak, rapid heartbeat difficulty staying awake These symptoms could be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis or a hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (see above) and you may need to be looked after in hospital. How to prevent hyperglycaemia There are simple ways to reduce your risk of severe or prolonged hyperglycaemia: Be careful what you eat \u2013 be particularly aware of how snacking and eating sugary foods or carbohydrates can affect your blood sugar level. Stick to your treatment plan \u2013 remember to take your insulin or other diabetes medications as recommended by your care team. Be as active as possible \u2013 getting regular exercise can help stop your blood sugar level rising, but you should check with your doctor first if you're taking diabetes medication, as some medicines can lead to hypoglycaemia if you exercise too much Take extra care when you're ill \u2013 your care team can provide you with some \"sick day rules\" that outline what you can do to keep your blood sugar level under control during an illness. Monitor your blood sugar level \u2013 your care team may suggest using a device to check your level at home, so you can spot an increase early and take steps to stop it.

It's mainly made by the liver, but can also be found in some foods. Having an excessively high level of lipids in your blood (hyperlipidemia) can have an effect on your health. High cholesterol itself doesn't usually cause any symptoms, but it increases your risk of serious health conditions. About cholesterol Cholesterol is carried in your blood by proteins. When the two combine, they're called lipoproteins. The two main types of lipoprotein are:  high-density lipoprotein (HDL) \u2013 carries cholesterol away from the cells and back to the liver, where it's either broken down or passed out of the body as a waste product; for this reason, HDL is referred to as \"good cholesterol\", and higher levels are better low-density lipoprotein (LDL) \u2013 carries cholesterol to the cells that need it, but if there's too much cholesterol for the cells to use, it can build up in the artery walls, leading to disease of the arteries; for this reason, LDL is known as \"bad cholesterol\" The amount of cholesterol in the blood \u2013 both HDL and LDL \u2013 can be measured with a blood test. The recommended cholesterol levels in the blood vary between those with a higher or lower risk of developing arterial disease. Why should I lower my cholesterol? Evidence strongly indicates that high cholesterol can increase the risk of: narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)  heart attack  stroke  transient ischaemic attack (TIA) \u2013 often known as a \"mini stroke\" peripheral arterial disease (PAD) This is because cholesterol can build up in the artery wall, restricting the blood flow to your heart, brain and the rest of your body. It also increases the risk of a blood clot developing somewhere in your body. Your risk of developing coronary heart disease also rises as your blood's cholesterol level increases. This can cause pain in your chest or arm during stress or physical activity (angina). What causes high cholesterol? Many factors can increase your chances of having heart problems or a stroke if you have high cholesterol. These include: an unhealthy diet \u2013 in particular, eating high levels of saturated fat smoking \u2013 a chemical found in cigarettes called acrolein stops HDL transporting cholesterol from fatty deposits to the liver, leading to narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) having diabetes or high blood pressure (hypertension) having a family history of stroke or heart disease There's also an inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolaemia, which can cause high cholesterol even in someone who eats healthily. Read more about the causes of high cholesterol. When should my cholesterol levels be tested? Your GP may recommend that you have your blood cholesterol levels tested if you: have been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, stroke or mini stroke (TIA), or peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have a family history of early cardiovascular disease have a close family member who has a cholesterol-related condition are overweight have high blood pressure, diabetes, or a health condition that can increase cholesterol levels Read more about how cholesterol is tested. What should my cholesterol levels be? Blood cholesterol is measured in units called millimoles per litre of blood, often shortened to mmol\/L. As a general guide, total cholesterol levels should be: 5mmol\/L or less for healthy adults 4mmol\/L or less for those at high risk As a general guide, LDL levels should be: 3mmol\/L or less for healthy adults 2mmol\/L or less for those at high risk An ideal level of HDL is above 1mmol\/L. A lower level of HDL can increase your risk of heart disease. Your ratio of total cholesterol to HDL may also be calculated. This is your total cholesterol level divided by your HDL level. Generally, this ratio should be below four, as a higher ratio increases your risk of heart disease. However, cholesterol is only one risk factor and the level at which specific treatment is required will depend on whether other risk factors, such as smoking and high blood pressure, are also present. How can I lower my cholesterol level? The first step in reducing your cholesterol is to maintain a healthy, balanced diet. It's important to keep your diet low in fatty food. You can swap food containing saturated fat for fruit, vegetables and wholegrain cereals. This will also help prevent high cholesterol returning. Other lifestyle changes, such as taking regular exercise and giving up smoking (if you smoke), can also make a big difference in helping to lower your cholesterol. If these measures don't reduce your cholesterol and you continue to have a high risk of developing heart disease, your GP may prescribe a cholesterol-lowering medication, such as statins. Your GP will take into account the risk of any side effects from statins, and the benefit of lowering your cholesterol must outweigh any risks. Read more about how high cholesterol is treated.

LDL cholesterol is often referred to as \"bad cholesterol\", and statins reduce the production of it inside the liver. Why have I been offered statins? Having a high level of LDL cholesterol is potentially dangerous, as it can lead to a hardening and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is a general term that describes a disease of the heart or blood vessels. It's the most common cause of death in the UK. The main types of CVD are: coronary heart disease \u2013 when the blood supply to the heart becomes restricted angina \u2013 sharp chest pain, caused by coronary heart disease heart attacks \u2013 when the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked stroke \u2013 when the supply of blood to the brain becomes blocked Your doctor may recommend taking statins if either: you've been diagnosed with a form of CVD your personal and family medical history suggests you're likely to develop CVD at some point over the next 10 years and lifestyle measures (see below) haven't reduced this risk Read more about when statins may be recommended. Taking statins Statins come as tablets that are taken once a day. The tablets should normally be taken at the same time each day \u2013 most people take them just before going to bed. In most cases, treatment with statins continues for life, as stopping the medication causes your cholesterol to return to a high level within a few weeks. If you ever forget to take your dose, don't take an extra one to make up for it. Just take your next dose as usual the following day. If you accidentally take too many statin tablets (more than your usual daily dose), contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice, or call NHS 111. Cautions and interactions Statins can sometimes interact with other medicines, increasing the risk of unpleasant side effects, such as muscle damage. Some types of statin can also interact with grapefruit juice. It's very important to read the information leaflet that comes with your medication, to check if there are any interactions you should be aware of. If in doubt, contact your GP or pharmacist for advice. Read more things to consider when taking statins. Side effects of statins Many people who take statins experience no or very few side effects. Others experience some troublesome \u2013 but usually minor \u2013 side effects, such as an upset stomach, headache or feeling sick. Your doctor should discuss the risks and benefits of taking statins if they're offered to you. Cases that involve more serious side effects, such as kidney failure, tend to get a great deal of media coverage, but these are rare. The British Heart Foundation states than just 1 in every 10,000 people who take statins will experience a potentially dangerous side effect. The risks of any side effects also have to be balanced against the benefits of preventing serious problems. A review of scientific studies into the effectiveness of statins found that around one in every 50 people who take the medication for five years will avoid a serious event, such as a heart attack or stroke, as a result. Read more about the side effects of statins. Alternatives to statins If you're at risk of developing CVD in the near future, your doctor will usually recommend lifestyle measures to reduce this risk before they suggest that you take statins. Lifestyle measures that can reduce your cholesterol level and CVD risk include: eating a healthy, balanced diet exercising regularly maintaining a healthy weight limiting the amount of alcohol you drink stopping smoking Statins may be recommended if these measures don\u2019t help.

It's sometimes known as congenital hip dislocation or hip dysplasia. The hip joint attaches the thigh bone (femur) to the pelvis. The top of the femur (femoral head) is rounded like a ball and sits inside the cup-shaped hip socket. In DDH, the socket of the hip is too shallow and the femoral head isn't held tightly in place, so the hip joint is loose. In severe cases, the femur can come out of the socket (dislocate). DDH may affect one or both hips but is more common in the left hip. It's also more common in girls and firstborn children. About 1 or 2 in every 1,000 babies have DDH that needs treating. Without treatment, DDH may lead to problems later in life, including: developing a limp hip pain \u2013 especially during the teenage years painful and stiff joints (osteoarthritis) With early diagnosis and treatment, most children are able to develop normally and have a full range of movement in their hip. Diagnosing DDH Within 72 hours of giving birth, your baby's hips will be checked as part of the newborn physical examination. Another hip examination is carried out when your baby is between six and eight weeks old. The examination involves gentle manipulation of your baby's hip joints to check if there are any problems, and shouldn't cause them any discomfort. An ultrasound scan is usually recommended within a few weeks if: the hip feels unstable there's a family history of childhood hip problems your baby was born in the breech position (feet first with their bottom downwards) you've had twins or a multiple birth your baby was born prematurely \u2013 before the 37th week of pregnancy Sometimes a baby's hip stabilises on its own before the scan is due. Treating DDH Pavlik harness Babies diagnosed with DDH early in life are usually treated with a fabric splint known as a Pavlik harness. This secures both of your baby's hips in a stable position and allows them to develop normally. The harness needs to be worn constantly for several weeks and shouldn't be removed by anyone except a health professional. The harness may be adjusted during follow-up appointments and your clinician will discuss your baby's progress with you. Your hospital will provide detailed instructions on how to look after your baby while they're in a Pavlik harness. This will include information on: how to change your baby's clothes without removing the harness (nappies can be worn normally) cleaning the harness if it's soiled \u2013 it still shouldn't be removed, but may be cleaned with detergent and an old toothbrush or nail brush positioning your baby while they sleep \u2013 they should be placed on their back and not on their side how to help avoid skin irritation around the straps of the harness \u2013 you may be advised to wrap some soft, hygienic material around the bands Eventually, you may be given advice on removing and replacing the harness for short periods of time until it can be permanently removed. You'll be encouraged to allow your baby to move freely when the harness is off and swimming is often recommended. Surgery Surgery may be needed if your baby is diagnosed with DDH after they're six months old, or if the Pavlik harness hasn't worked. The most common surgical technique is known as reduction, which involves placing the ball of the femur back into the hip socket. Reduction is carried out under general anaesthetic and may be performed as either: closed reduction \u2013 the ball is placed in the socket without making any large cuts (incisions) open reduction \u2013 an incision is made in the groin to allow the surgeon to place the ball in the socket Your child will need a hip cast for at least six weeks after surgery. Their hip will need to be checked under general anaesthetic again after this time to make sure it's stable and healing well. After this investigation, a cast will probably be needed for at least another six weeks to allow the hip to fully stabilise. Some children may also require bone surgery (osteotomy) during an open reduction, or at a later date to correct any bone deformities. Late-stage signs of DDH The newborn physical examination and the check at six to eight weeks aim to diagnose DDH early. However, sometimes hip problems can develop after these checks. It's important to contact your GP as soon as possible if you notice your child develops any of the following symptoms: restricted movement in one leg when you change their nappy one leg drags behind the other when they crawl one leg appears longer than the other uneven skin folds in the buttocks or thighs a limp, walking on toes or developing an abnormal 'waddling' walk Your child will be referred to an orthopaedic specialist in hospital for an ultrasound scan or an X-ray if your doctor thinks there's a problem with their hip. Preventing DDH It's important to remember that DDH can't be prevented and it's nobody's fault. A baby's hips are naturally more flexible for a short period after birth. However, if your baby spends a lot of time tightly wrapped with their legs straight and pressed together (swaddled), there's a risk this may slow their hip development. Using 'hip healthy' swaddling techniques can reduce this risk. Make sure your baby is able to move their hips and knees freely to kick. You can read about hip-healthy swaddling on The International Hip Dysplasia Institute website.

Doctors sometimes refer to hip fractures as proximal femoral fractures. The hip joints The hip joints attach your thigh bones (femurs) to your pelvis. Hip joints are ball-and-socket joints. The ball is the rounded top part of the femur. The socket is the cup-shaped part of the pelvic bone that the rounded end of the femur sits inside. A hip fracture is a crack or break in the top end (neck) of the femur, nearest the hip joint. It can either occur in the part of the femur inside the socket of the hip joint (intracapsular), or outside the socket (extracapsular). Symptoms of a hip fracture  Symptoms of a hip fracture include: not being able to lift, move or rotate (turn) your leg being unable to stand or put weight on your leg, although in some cases this is possible a shorter leg, or your leg turning outwards more on the injured side If you think you've fractured your hip, you'll need to go to hospital as soon as possible. Dial 999 to request an ambulance. Try not to move while you're waiting for the ambulance and make sure you keep warm. What causes hip fractures?  Hip fractures are often the result of a fall. Falls are very common in older people due to other health problems, such are reduced vision and mobility and balance problems. A fall can cause a hip fracture if a person has osteoporosis (weak and fragile bones). Some people find it hard to recover after a hip fracture, up to one in three people die within 12 months of fracturing their hip (although most deaths aren't caused by the fall itself but by pre-existing illnesses). This is why the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends a co-ordinated programme of care for people who've fractured a hip (see below). Treating a hip fracture Surgery is usually the only treatment option for hip fractures. NICE recommends that someone with a hip fracture should have surgery on the day they're admitted to hospital or the day after being admitted. In about half of all cases, a partial or complete hip replacement is needed. The rest require surgery to fix the fracture with plates and screws or rods. The type of surgery you have will depend on a number of factors, including: type of fracture (where on the femur it is) your age your level of mobility before the fracture the condition of the bone and joint \u2013 for example, whether you have arthritis Read more about treating a hip fracture. Recovering from hip surgery The aim after surgery is to speed up recovery to help regain your mobility. The day after surgery, you should have a physiotherapy assessment and be given a rehabilitation programme that includes realistic goals for you to achieve during your recovery. The aim is to help you regain your mobility and independence so that you can return home as soon as possible. Read more about your care after discharge from hospital. How long you'll need to stay in hospital will depend on your condition and mobility. After having a hip replacement, it may be possible for you to be discharged in three to five days. Evidence suggests that prompt surgery and a tailored rehabilitation programme that starts as soon as possible after surgery can significantly improve a person's life, reduce the length of their hospital stay and help them recover their mobility faster. Read more about recovering from a hip fracture. It may also be useful to read your guide to care and support \u2013 written not only for people with care and support needs, but their carers and relatives too. It includes information and advice on: transport and getting around with mobility issues rehabilitation or 'reablement' services choosing mobility equipment, wheelchairs and scooters  Complications of hip surgery Complications that can occur after a hip operation include: infection \u2013 occurs in about 1-3% of cases blood clots \u2013 can form in the deep veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis); they can be prevented using compression stockings, exercise and medication pressure ulcers \u2013 can develop on an area of skin that's under constant pressure due to being in a chair or bed for long periods Your surgeon will be able to discuss these and any other risks with you. Read more about the complications of a hip fracture. Preventing hip fractures It may be possible to prevent hip fractures by taking steps to prevent falls and by treating osteoporosis. You can reduce your risk of falling by: using walking aids, such as a walking stick assessing your home for hazards \u2013 such as loose carpeting \u2013 and making it safer using exercises to improve your balance Read more about preventing falls and preventing hip fractures. Major public health issue Hip fractures are a major public health issue due to an ever increasing ageing population (80 is the average age of a person who has a hip fracture). Around 70,000-75,000 hip fractures occur in the UK each year. The annual cost for all hip fractures in the UK, including medical and social care, is about £2 billion. Hip fractures are more common in women due to the higher incidence of osteoporosis (weak and fragile bones) in women.

This page aims to give you a better idea of whether osteoarthritis or something more unusual is causing your hip pain, and what you can do about it. However, don't try to diagnose the cause of your hip pain yourself \u2013 this should always be a matter for your doctor. Read about hip pain in children. Osteoarthritis The symptoms of osteoarthritis can vary greatly from person to person, but if it affects the hip, it will typically cause: mild inflammation of the tissues in and around the hip joint damage to cartilage \u2013 the strong, flexible tissue that lines the bones bony growths (osteophytes) that develop around the edge of the hip joint This can lead to pain, stiffness and difficulty doing certain activities.

When to seek medical advice Hip pain often gets better on its own, and can be managed with rest and over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen.  However, see your GP if: your hip is still painful after one week of resting it at home you also have a fever or rash your hip pain came on suddenly and you have sickle cell anaemia the pain is in both hips and other joints as well Your GP may ask you the following questions: Where do you feel the pain? When and how did the pain start? Does anything make the pain worse? Does anything relieve the pain? Can you walk and bear weight on it? Do you have any other medical problems? Do you take any medicines? Go straight to hospital if: the hip pain was caused by a serious fall or accident your leg is deformed, badly bruised or bleeding you're unable to move your hip or bear any weight on your leg you have hip pain with a temperature and feel unwell  Managing hip pain at home If you don't immediately need to see a doctor, consider managing and monitoring the problem at home. The following advice may be helpful: lose weight if you're overweight to relieve some of the strain on your hip avoid activities that make the pain worse, such as downhill running wear flat shoes and avoid standing for long periods  consider seeing a physiotherapist for some muscle-strengthening exercises take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen Overactivity If your hip pain is related to exercising or other types of regular activity: cut down on the amount of exercise you do if it's excessive always warm up before exercising and stretch afterwards  try low-impact exercises, such as swimming or cycling, instead of running run on a smooth, soft surface, such as grass, rather than on concrete make sure your running shoes fit well and support your feet properly \u2013 read more about choosing sports shoes and trainers Page last reviewed: 24\/06\/2016 Next review due: 24\/06\/2019 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Doctors sometimes refer to irritable hip as transient or toxic synovitis. Hip pain isn't usually severe, but your child may be reluctant to place weight on the affected leg. Occasionally, an irritable hip may also cause: pain in the knee or thigh restricted movement in one of the hip joints a slightly higher temperature than normal \u2013 a normal temperature is around 37C (98.6F) In younger children who are unable to speak, the only noticeable symptom may be crying at night. When to see your GP Although irritable hip is usually a mild condition, you should take your child to see your GP if you are concerned about their hips, so that a diagnosis can be confirmed. This is because irritable hip shares symptoms of more serious hip conditions, such as septic arthritis (an infection inside the hip) or Perthes disease. Your GP will examine their hip and may recommend further tests to rule out other causes. These tests include: an X-ray to see if there's a problem with your child's bones blood tests to look for a bone or joint infection an ultrasound scan that will highlight any fluid that may be on the joint If there's fluid on the joint, a sample can be removed and checked for an infection. Just removing the fluid from the joint can ease the symptoms. What causes irritable hip? The condition develops when the lining that covers the hip joint (the synovial membrane) becomes irritated and inflamed, although the cause of inflammation is unclear. Some cases of irritable hip occur following a viral infection in the chest, throat or digestive system. Many experts think the synovial membrane in the hip becomes inflamed as a complication of the infection. However, there is no hard evidence to support this theory. Another theory is that a hip injury may cause the swelling, although many cases develop in children who do not have a history of injury. Who is affected? Irritable hip can affect boys and girls of any age, but is most common between the age of four and 10 years old. The condition affects twice as many boys than girls. Is it serious? As a parent, it can be very worrying if your child is diagnosed with irritable hip and is struggling to walk. However, the condition is usually short-lived. Most cases don't require specific treatment, because the pain usually passes within two weeks. A small number of children with irritable hip go on to have further episodes. However, these episodes usually become less frequent and eventually stop when the child is older. Recovery Ibuprofen, which is available over the counter, can be used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Your child should also rest the affected leg until symptoms have passed. Massaging the affected hip and applying heat may also help to reduce your child's hip pain. It usually takes a couple of weeks to recover from irritable hip, although your GP may recommend that your child does not play sport or take part in any strenuous activities for at least another two weeks following treatment. This is to reduce the chances of irritable hip returning. Swimming is a good way to strengthen the joint and get it moving again. A follow-up appointment may be needed up to six months later. This is to rule out other hip conditions that can also cause pain, stiffness and a limp.

The hips The hip joint is one of the largest joints in the human body and is what is known as a \"ball and socket joint\". In a healthy hip joint, the bones are connected to each other with bands of tissue known as ligaments. These ligaments are lubricated with fluid to reduce friction. Joints are also surrounded by a type of tissue called cartilage that is designed to help support the joints and prevent bones from rubbing against each other. The main purpose of the hip joints is to support the upper body when a person is standing, walking and running, and to help with certain movements, such as bending and stretching. Why do I need a hip replacement? It might be necessary for you to have a hip replacement if one (or both) of your hip joints becomes damaged and causes you persistent pain or problems with everyday activities such as walking, driving and getting dressed. Some common reasons why a hip joint can become damaged include: osteoarthritis \u2013 so-called \"wear and tear arthritis\", where the cartilage inside a hip joint becomes worn away, leading to the bones rubbing against each other rheumatoid arthritis \u2013 this is caused by the immune system (the body\u2019s defence against infection) mistakenly attacking the lining of the joint, resulting in pain and stiffness hip fracture \u2013 if a hip joint becomes severely damaged during a fall or similar accident it may be necessary to replace it Many of the conditions treated with a hip replacement are age-related so hip replacements are usually carried out in older adults aged between 60 and 80. However, a hip replacement may occasionally be performed in younger people. The purpose of a new hip joint is to: relieve pain improve the function of your hip improve your ability to move around improve your quality of life Read more about why a hip replacement may be necessary. What happens during hip replacement surgery? A hip replacement can be carried out under a general anaesthetic (where you are asleep during the procedure) or an epidural (where the lower body is numbed). The surgeon makes an incision into the hip, removes the damaged hip joint and then replaces it with an artificial joint that is a metal alloy or, in some cases, ceramic. The surgery usually takes around 60-90 minutes to complete. Read more about how a hip replacement is performed. Recovering from hip replacement surgery For the first four to six weeks after the operation you will need a walking aid, such as crutches, to help support you. You may also be enrolled on an exercise programme that is designed to help you regain and then improve the use of your new hip joint. Most people are able to resume normal activities within two to three months but it can take up to a year before you experience the full benefits of your new hip. Read more about recovering from hip replacement surgery. What to expect after a hip replacement Since its introduction in the 1960s, hip replacement surgery has proved to be one of the most effective types of surgery in modern medical history. Most people experience a significant reduction in pain and, to a lesser extent, improvement in their range of movement. However, it is important to have realistic expectations about what the operation can achieve. For example, you should be able to ride a bike but it is unlikely that you would be able to play a game of rugby safely (although, as with most things, there are always exceptions to this rule). The rehabilitation process after surgery can be a demanding time and requires commitment. Risks of hip replacement surgery Complications of a hip replacement can include: hip dislocation infection at the site of the surgery injuries to the blood vessels or nerves a fracture differences in leg length However, the risk of serious complications is low \u2013 estimated to be less than 1 in a 100. Read more about the risks of a hip replacement. A modern artificial hip joint is designed to last for at least 15 years, but there is always the risk that the artificial hip joint can wear out or go wrong in some way before this time, meaning that further surgery is required to repair or replace the joint. This is known as revision surgery. It is estimated that around 1 in 10 people with an artificial hip will require revision surgery at a later date. There have been recent cases of metal-on-metal (MoM) replacements wearing quicker than would be expected, causing deterioration in the bone and tissue around the hip. There are also concerns that they could leak traces of metal into the bloodstream. For more information, read our metal-on-metal hip implant advice Q&A.   Alternatives There is an alternative type of surgery to hip replacement, known as hip resurfacing. This involves removing the damaged surfaces of the bones inside the hip joint and replacing them with a metal surface. An advantage to this approach is that it removes less bone. However, it is usually only effective in younger adults who have relatively strong bones. Resurfacing is much less popular now due to concerns about the metal surface causing damage to soft tissues around the hip. Read more about alternatives to hip replacements. Future developments Hip replacement surgery is being improved in several ways: New, stronger materials for prosthetics are being developed that will allow longer wear and better joint mobility. Enhancements are being made to new \"cementless\" implants. Patients can be recommended for newer types of joints, such as ceramic-on-ceramic and ceramic-on-plastic. Computer-assisted surgery is being used to generate an image of the hip joint to allow greater precision. Another area of research is looking at regenerating a hip joint by transfusing stem cells into damaged tissue. Stem cells are specialised cells that have a useful ability to help replenish other types of cells.   Hip operation: animation Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video. This detailed animation explains how a hip replacement is done and why it would be needed. Media last reviewed: 26\/05\/2015 Next review due: 26\/05\/2017 How common are hip replacements? Hip replacements are a very common procedure. In 2013, the NHS performed just over 66,000 hip procedures in England and Wales. Worries over metal-on-metal implants There have been cases of some metal-on-metal hip replacements wearing sooner than would be expected, causing deterioration in the bone and tissue around the hip. There are also concerns that they could leak traces of metal into the bloodstream. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued new guidelines that certain types of metal-on-metal (MoM) devices should be checked every year while the implant is in place. This is so that any potential complications can be picked up early. If you are concerned about your hip replacement contact your GP or orthopaedic surgeon. They can give you a record of the type of hip replacement you have and tell you if any follow-up is required. You should also see your doctor if you have: pain in the groin, hip or leg swelling at or near the hip joint a limp, or problems walking grinding or clunking from the hip These symptoms do not necessarily mean that your device is failing, but they do need investigating. Any changes in your general health should also be reported, including: chest pain or shortness of breath numbness, weakness, change in vision or hearing fatigue, feeling cold, weight gain change in urination habits For more information read our metal-on-metal implant advice Q&A.

It mainly affects babies and young children. Normally, the bowel continuously squeezes and relaxes to push poo along, a process controlled by your nervous system. In Hirschsprung's disease, the nerves that control this movement are missing from a section at the end of the bowel, which means poo can build up and form a blockage. This can cause severe constipation, and occasionally lead to a serious bowel infection called enterocolitis if it's not identified and treated early on. However, the condition is usually picked up soon after birth and treated with surgery as soon as possible. This page covers: Symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease When to get medical advice How Hirschsprung's disease is diagnosed What causes Hirschsprung's disease? Treatments for Hirschsprung's disease Outlook for Hirschsprung's disease Symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease Symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease are usually noticeable from soon after a baby is born, although occasionally they're not obvious until a child is a year or two old. Signs of the condition in a baby include: failing to pass meconium within 48 hours \u2013 the dark, tar-like poo that healthy babies pass soon after being born a swollen belly vomiting green fluid (bile) Signs in older infants and children include: a swollen belly and a tummy ache persistent constipation that doesn't get better with the usual treatments not feeding well or gaining much weight If your child develops a bowel infection (enterocolitis), they may also have a high temperature (fever) and watery, foul-smelling diarrhoea. When to get medical advice Visit your GP if your child develops the symptoms described above. Hirschsprung's disease can be serious if left untreated, so it's important to get help as soon as possible. If your GP suspects the condition, they will refer you to hospital for tests to confirm the diagnosis. How Hirschsprung's disease is diagnosed Your child's tummy will usually be examined and sometimes a rectal examination may be carried out. This is where a doctor or nurse inserts a finger into the back passage (rectum) to feel for abnormalities. If Hirschsprung's disease is suspected, an X-ray can be done to show a blockage and bulge in the bowel. The diagnosis can be confirmed by doing a rectal biopsy, which involves inserting a small instrument into your child's bottom to remove a tiny sample of the affected bowel. This is then examined under the microscope to see if the nerve cells are missing. What causes Hirschsprung's disease? The muscles of the bowel are controlled by nerve cells called ganglion cells. In Hirschsprung's disease, these ganglion cells are missing from a section at the end of bowel, extending up from the anus, the opening in the bottom that poo passes through. For some reason, the cells didn't develop in that area when the baby was growing in the womb. It's not clear why this happens, but it's not thought to be caused by anything the mother did while she was pregnant. A number of genes are associated with Hirschsprung's disease and it does sometimes run in families. If you've had a child with it before, you're more likely to have another child with it. The condition is occasionally part of a wider genetic condition, such as Down's syndrome, but most cases aren't. Treatments for Hirschsprung's disease All children with Hirschsprung's disease will need surgery. As they wait for surgery, they may need to: stop having milk feeds and instead be given fluids directly into a vein have a tube passed through their nose and into their stomach to drain away any fluid and air collecting in it have regular bowel washouts, where a thin tube is inserted into their bottom and warm salt water is used to soften and flush out the trapped stools take antibiotics if they have enterocolitis Your child may need to stay in hospital during this time, or you may be able to look after them at home. Your doctor will advise you about this. Surgery Most children will have the \"pull-through\" operation, where the affected section of bowel is removed and the remaining healthy sections of bowel are joined together. This will usually be done when they're around three months old. If your child isn't well enough to have this procedure \u2013 for example, because they have enterocolitis or a severe blockage \u2013 they may have it in two stages. A few days after birth, the surgeon will divert the bowel through a temporary opening (stoma) made in the tummy. This procedure is called a colostomy formation. Stools will pass directly out of the opening into a pouch worn on your child's body until they're well enough to have another procedure to remove the affected section of bowel, close the opening, and join the healthy sections of bowel together. This is usually done at around three months of age. These procedures can be done using either: laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery \u2013 this involves inserting surgical instruments through tiny cuts  open surgery \u2013 where a larger cut is made in your child's tummy Speak to your surgeon about the best option for your child. Risks of surgery No surgery is risk-free. There's a small chance of: bleeding during or after the operation the bowel becoming infected (enterocolitis) bowel contents leaking into the body, which could lead to serious infection (peritonitis) if not treated quickly the bowel becoming narrowed or blocked again, requiring further surgery Recovery from surgery Your child will probably need to stay in hospital for a few days after surgery. They'll be given pain-relieving medicine to make them comfortable and fluids into a vein until they can manage food. No special diet is needed once you get home, but it's important they drink plenty of fluids as they recover.  Your child should recover well and their bowels should function normally after surgery. At first they'll probably have a sore bottom when they poo. It can help to leave their bottom open to the air whenever possible, and use baby oil to gently clean their bottom as well as nappy cream after each change. Call your doctor immediately if your child develops problems such as a swollen belly, fever, or foul-smelling diarrhoea. Outlook for Hirschsprung's disease Most children are able to pass stools normally and have a normal functioning bowel after surgery, although they may take a bit longer to toilet train. Some may experience persistent constipation and need to follow a high-fibre diet and take laxatives. Your doctor will advise about this treatment. A small number of children have problems controlling their bowels (bowel incontinence), which can last until they're a teenager and be very distressing.  Speak to your GP if this is a problem. You can also read advice about soiling in children. Information about your child If your child has been affected by Hirschsprung's disease, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

It's a problem that mainly affects women. It's relatively common, although some women may find it embarrassing or distressing to live with. It's often a long-term problem, but there are a number of treatments that can help keep it under control. This page covers: Symptoms of hirsutism When to see your GP Treatments for hirsutism Causes of hirsutism Symptoms of hirsutism The excessive hair in hirsutism is usually thick and dark, rather than fine and fair. It develops in areas where men often have hair, such as the: face neck chest tummy lower back buttocks thighs You may also have some additional symptoms, such as oily skin, acne, a deep voice, irregular periods or no periods at all. When to see your GP It's a good idea to see your GP if you have hirsutism. They can look for any underlying cause and advise you about the treatments available. Your GP may: examine the areas of excess hair growth ask about any other symptoms ask about your medical history, such as whether you're taking any medication carry out a blood test to check your hormone levels Depending on what your GP thinks may be causing your symptoms, they may treat you themselves or you may be referred to a specialist. Treatments for hirsutism Treatment for hirsutism usually involves techniques to remove the excess hair and treatment to help slow its growth or stop it coming back. The main treatments are: home hair removal methods \u2013 such as shaving, plucking or waxing specialist hair removal treatments \u2013 such as laser hair removal eflornithine cream \u2013 a prescription cream that can help slow down the growth of facial hair oral contraceptives, including co-cyprindiol tablets \u2013 a type of contraceptive pill available on prescription that can help prevent excess hair growth It may take a few months to notice the effects of treatment, so it's important to persist with it. In many cases, treatment will need to be continued indefinitely. Read more about the treatments for hirsutism. Causes of hirsutism Hirsutism is caused by an excess of male hormones called androgens in your body, or by your body being more sensitive to these hormones. In many cases, it's not clear why this happens. Some women just seem to develop extra hair growth as they get older, particularly after the menopause. In younger women, the most common cause is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition that can cause irregular periods and fluid-filled sacs (cysts) on the ovaries. Less common causes of hirsutism include: Cushing's syndrome \u2013 a hormonal disorder that causes sudden weight gain and bloating around the face and neck congenital adrenal hyperplasia \u2013 an inherited condition affecting the adrenal glands, the glands above the kidneys that produce hormones obesity \u2013 losing weight may help improve the symptoms in these cases acromegaly \u2013 a condition in which the body produces too much growth hormone medicines \u2013 such as anabolic steroids, used by some people to build muscle and improve athletic performance a tumour (growth) \u2013 that increases the production of androgens and usually affects the ovaries or adrenal glands Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 06\/05\/2016 Next review due: 06\/05\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's most commonly caught by having sex without a condom. It can also be passed on by sharing infected needles and other injecting equipment, and from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. The virus attacks the immune system, and weakens your ability to fight infections and disease. There is no cure for HIV, but there are treatments to enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life. AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection, when your body can no longer fight life-threatening infections. With early diagnosis and effective treatment, most people with HIV will not go on to develop AIDS. How do you get HIV? HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person, which includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood, and breast milk. It is a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long. HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat or urine. The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is by anal or vaginal sex without a condom. According to statistics from Public Health England, 95% of those diagnosed with HIV in the UK in 2013 acquired HIV as a result of sexual contact. Other ways of getting HIV include: using a contaminated needle, syringe or other injecting equipment transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding It's also possible for HIV to spread through oral sex and sharing sex toys, although the chances of this happening are very low. For example, it's estimated that you only have a 1 in 5,000 chance of getting HIV if you give unprotected oral sex to someone with the infection. Read more about what causes HIV. Getting tested for HIV Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV. The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection. It's important to be aware that: emergency anti-HIV medication called PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) may stop you becoming infected if started within three days of possible exposure to the virus, and starting it as soon as possible is recommended an early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the condition HIV tests may need to be repeated one to three months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the \"window period\"), but you shouldn't wait this long to seek help you can get tested in a number of places, including your GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities such as the find HIV testing services near you  clinic tests can sometimes give you a result in minutes, although it may take a few days to get the result of a more detailed blood test home-testing or home-sampling kits are available to buy or order online or from pharmacies \u2013 depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few days If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result. If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options. Read more about diagnosing HIV. Treating and living with HIV Although there is no cure for HIV, treatments are now very effective, enabling people with HIV to live long and healthy lives. Medication, known as antiretrovirals, work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. These medicines come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day. HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV drug very easily, but taking a combination of different drugs makes this much less likely. Most people with HIV take a combination of three antiretrovirals and it is vital that the medications are taken every day as recommended by your doctor. For people living with HIV, taking effective antiretroviral therapy (where the HIV virus is \"undetectable\" in blood tests) will significantly reduce the risk of passing on HIV to sexual partners. It is rare for a pregnant woman living with HIV to transmit it to their babies, provided they receive timely and effective antiretroviral therapy and medical care. You will also be encouraged to take regular exercise, eat a healthy diet, stop smoking and have yearly flu jabs to minimise the risk of getting serious illnesses. Without treatment, the immune system will become severely damaged and life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and severe infections can occur. This is known as late-stage HIV infection or AIDS. Read more about living with HIV. Preventing HIV Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV infection. The best way to prevent HIV is to use a condom for sex and to never share needles or other injecting equipment (including syringes, spoons and swabs). Knowing your HIV status and that of your partner is also important. For people with HIV, effective antiretroviral therapy significantly reduces the risk of passing HIV to sexual partners. How common is HIV? At the end of 2014, there were an estimated 103,700 people in the UK living with HIV. The majority were infected through sex (43,000 gay and bisexual men and 54,100 heterosexuals). An estimated 17% of people with HIV (18,100) do not know they are infected. Around one in every 620 people in the UK has HIV, but the two groups with highest rates of HIV are gay and bisexual men (approximately 1 in 20) and Black African heterosexuals (approximately 1 in 56 men and 1 in 22 women). The World Health Organization estimates that around 35 million people in the world are living with HIV. The virus is more common in many sub-Saharan African countries.

Although the affected area may change in appearance within 24 hours, the rash usually settles within a few days. Doctors may refer to urticaria as either: acute urticaria \u2013 if the rash clears completely within six weeks chronic urticaria \u2013 in rarer cases, where the rash persists or comes and goes for more than six weeks, often over many years A much rarer type of urticaria, known as urticaria vasculitis, can cause blood vessels inside the skin to become inflamed. In these cases, the weals last longer than 24 hours, are more painful, and can leave a bruise. When to seek medical advice Visit your GP if your symptoms don't go away within 48 hours. You should also contact your GP if your symptoms are: severe causing distress disrupting daily activities occurring alongside other symptoms Who's affected by urticaria? Acute urticaria (also known as short-term urticaria) is a common condition, estimated to affect around one in five people at some point in their lives. Children are often affected by the condition, as well as women aged 30 to 60, and people with a history of allergies. Chronic urticaria (also known as long-term urticaria) is much less common, affecting up to five in every 1,000 people in England. What causes urticaria? Urticaria occurs when a trigger causes high levels of histamine and other chemical messengers to be released in the skin. These substances cause the blood vessels in the affected area of skin to open up (often resulting in redness or pinkness) and become leaky. This extra fluid in the tissues causes swelling and itchiness. Histamine is released for many reasons, including: an allergic reaction \u2013 such as a food allergy or a reaction to an insect bite or sting cold or heat exposure  infection \u2013 such as a cold certain medications \u2013 such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or antibiotics However, in many cases of urticaria, no obvious cause can be found. Some cases of long-term urticaria may be caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue. However, this is difficult to diagnose and the treatment options are the same. Certain triggers may also make the symptoms worse. These include: drinking alcohol or caffeine emotional stress warm temperature Read more about the causes of urticaria. Diagnosing urticaria Your GP will usually be able to diagnose urticaria by examining the rash. They may also ask you questions to find out what triggered your symptoms. If your GP thinks that it's caused by an allergic reaction, you may be referred to an allergy clinic for an allergy test. However, if you've had urticaria most days for more than six weeks, it's unlikely to be the result of an allergy. You may also be referred for a number of tests, including a full blood count (FBC), to find out whether there's an underlying cause of your symptoms. Read more about diagnosing urticaria. Treating urticaria In many cases, treatment isn't needed for urticaria, because the rash often gets better within a few days. If the itchiness is causing you discomfort, antihistamines can help. Antihistamines are available over the counter at pharmacies \u2013 speak to your pharmacist for advice. A short course of steroid tablets (oral corticosteroids) may occasionally be needed for more severe cases of urticaria. If you have persistent urticaria, you may be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist). Treatment usually involves medication to relieve the symptoms, while identifying and avoiding potential triggers. Read about treating urticaria. Complications of urticaria Around a quarter of people with acute urticaria and half of people with chronic urticaria also develop angioedema, which is a deeper swelling of tissues. Chronic urticaria can also be upsetting and negatively impact a person's mood and quality of life. Angioedema Angioedema is swelling in the deeper layers of a person's skin. It's often severe and is caused by a build-up of fluid. The symptoms of angioedema can affect any part of the body, but usually affect the: eyes lips genitals hands feet Medication such as antihistamines and short courses of oral corticosteroids (tablets) can be used to relieve the swelling. Read more about treating angioedema. Emotional impact Living with any long-term condition can be difficult. Chronic urticaria can have a considerable negative impact on a person's mood and quality of life. Living with itchy skin can be particularly upsetting. One study found that chronic urticaria can have the same negative impact as heart disease. It also found that one in seven people with chronic urticaria had some sort of psychological or emotional problem, such as:  stress anxiety depression See your GP if your urticaria is getting you down. Effective treatments are available to improve your symptoms. Talking to friends and family can also improve feelings of isolation and help you cope better with your condition. Read about how talking to others can help. Anaphylaxis Urticaria can be one of the first symptoms of a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. Other symptoms of anaphylaxis include: swollen eyes, lips, hands and feet feeling lightheaded or faint narrowing of the airways, which can cause wheezing and breathing difficulties abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting  collapsing and becoming unconsciousness Anaphylaxis should always be treated as a medical emergency. Call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you or someone else is experiencing anaphylaxis. Tell the operator about your (or their) symptoms.

The items can be of little or no monetary value and usually result in unmanageable amounts of clutter. It's considered to be a significant problem if: the amount of clutter interferes with everyday living \u2013 for example, the person is unable to use their kitchen or bathroom and cannot access rooms the clutter is causing significant distress or negatively affecting the person's quality of life or their family's \u2013 for example, they become upset if someone tries to clear the clutter and their relationships with others suffer Hoarding disorders are challenging to treat, because many people who hoard frequently don't see it as a problem, or have little awareness of how it's impacting their life or the lives of others. Many others do realise they have a problem, but are reluctant to seek help because they feel extremely ashamed, humiliated or guilty about it. It's really important to encourage a person who is hoarding to seek help, as their difficulties discarding objects can not only cause loneliness and mental health problems, but also pose a health and safety risk. If not tackled, it's a problem that will probably never go away. This page explains: why someone may hoard what's the difference between hoarding and collecting? signs of a hoarding disorder items people may hoard why hoarding disorders are a problem what you can do if you suspect someone is hoarding how hoarding disorders are treated Why someone may hoard The reasons why someone begins hoarding aren't fully understood. It can be a symptom of another condition. For example, someone with mobility problems may be physically unable to clear the huge amounts of clutter they have acquired. People with learning disabilities or people developing dementia may be unable to categorise and dispose of items. Mental health problems associated with hoarding include: severe depression psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) In some cases, hoarding is a condition in itself and often associated with self-neglect. These people are more likely to: live alone be unmarried have had a deprived childhood, with either a lack of material objects or a poor relationship with other members of their family have a family history of hoarding have grown up in a cluttered home and never learned to prioritise and sort items Many people who hoard have strongly held beliefs related to acquiring and discarding things, such as: \"I may need this someday\" or \"If I buy this, it will make me happy\". Others may be struggling to cope with a stressful life event, such as the death of a loved one (bereavement). Attempts to discard things often bring up very strong emotions that can feel overwhelming, so the person hoarding often tends to put off or avoid making decisions about what can be thrown out. Often, many of the things kept are of little or no monetary value and may be what most people would consider rubbish. The person may keep the items for reasons not obvious to other people, such as sentimental reasons, or feeling the objects appear beautiful or useful. Most people with a hoarding disorder have a very strong emotional attachment to the objects. What's the difference between hoarding and collecting? Many people collect items such as books or stamps and this isn\u2019t considered a problem. The difference between a \"hoard\" and a \"collection\" is how these items are organised. A collection is usually well-ordered and the items are easily accessible. A hoard is usually very disorganised, takes up a lot of room and the items are largely inaccessible. For example, someone who collects newspaper reviews may cut out the reviews they want and organise them in a catalogue or scrapbook. Someone who hoards may keep large stacks of newspapers that clutter their entire house and mean it\u2019s not actually possible to read any of the reviews they wanted to keep. Signs of a hoarding disorder Someone who has a hoarding disorder may typically: keep or collect items that may have little or no monetary value, such as junk mail and carrier bags, or items they intend to reuse or repair (see below)  find it hard to categorise or organise items have difficulties making decisions struggle to manage everyday tasks, such as cooking, cleaning and paying bills become extremely attached to items, refusing to let anyone touch or borrow them have poor relationships with family or friends Hoarding can start as early as the teenage years and gets more noticeable with age. Many people seem to start problematic hoarding in older age. It's estimated that between 2% and 5% of adults in the UK may have symptoms of a hoarding disorder. Items people may hoard Some people with a hoarding disorder will hoard a range of items, while others may just hoard certain types of objects. Items that are often hoarded include: newspapers and magazines books clothes leaflets and letters, including junk mail bills and receipts containers, including plastic bags and cardboard boxes household supplies Some people also hoard animals, which they may not be able to look after properly. More recently, hoarding of data has become more common. This is where someone stores huge amounts of electronic data and emails that they're extremely reluctant to delete. Why hoarding disorders are a problem A hoarding disorder can be a problem for several reasons. It can take over the person's life, making it very difficult for them to get around their house. It can cause their work performance, personal hygiene and relationships to suffer. The person hoarding is usually reluctant or unable to have visitors, or even allowing tradesmen in to carry out essential repairs, which can cause isolation and loneliness. The clutter can pose a health risk to the person and anyone who lives in or visits their house. For example, it can: make cleaning very difficult, leading to unhygienic conditions and encouraging rodent or insect infestations be a fire risk and block exits in the event of a fire cause trips and falls fall over or collapse on people, if kept in large piles The hoarding could also be a sign of an underlying condition, such as OCD, other types of anxiety, depression and potentially more serious conditions, such as dementia. What you can do if you suspect someone is hoarding If you think a family member or someone you know has a hoarding disorder, try to persuade them to come with you to see a GP. This may not be easy, as someone who hoards might not think they need help. Try to be sensitive about the issue and emphasise your concerns for their health and wellbeing. Reassure them that nobody is going to go into their home and throw everything out. You're just going to have a chat with the doctor about their hoarding to see what can be done and what support is available to empower them to begin the process of decluttering. Your GP may be able to refer you to your local community mental health team, which might have a therapist who's familiar with issues such as OCD and hoarding. If you have difficulties accessing therapy, the charity OCD-UK may be able to help. It's generally not a good idea to get extra storage space or call in the council or environmental health to clear the rubbish away. This won't solve the problem and the clutter often quickly builds up again. How hoarding disorders are treated It's not easy to treat hoarding disorders, even when the person is prepared to seek help, but it can be overcome. The main treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The therapist will help the person to understand what makes it difficult to throw things away and the reasons why the clutter has built up. This will be combined with practical tasks and a plan to work on. It's important that the person takes responsibility for clearing the clutter from their home. The therapist will support and encourage this. Antidepressant medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have also been shown to help some people with hoarding disorders. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) CBT is a type of therapy that aims to help you manage your problems by changing how you think (cognitive) and act (behaviour). It encourages you to talk about how you think about yourself, the world and other people, and how what you do affects your thoughts and feelings. Regular sessions of CBT over a long period of time are usually necessary and will almost always need to include some home-based sessions, working directly on the clutter. This requires motivation, commitment and patience, as it can take many months to achieve the treatment goal. The goal is to improve the person's decision-making and organisational skills, help them overcome urges to save, and ultimately clear the clutter, room by room.  The therapist won't throw anything away, but will help guide and encourage the person to do so. The therapist can also help the person develop decision-making strategies, while identifying and challenging underlying beliefs that contribute to the hoarding problem. The person gradually becomes better at throwing things away, learning that nothing terrible happens when they do so, and becomes better at organising items they insist on keeping. At the end of treatment, the person may not have cleared all their clutter, but they will have gained a better understanding of their problem. They will have a plan to help them continue to build on their successes and avoid slipping back into their old ways.

The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells, known as lymphocytes. In Hodgkin lymphoma, B-lymphocytes (a particular type of lymphocyte) start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. Read more about the symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma. Who's affected? Hodgkin lymphoma can develop at any age, but it mostly affects young adults in their early 20s and older adults over the age of 70. Slightly more men than women are affected. Around 1,900 people are diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in the UK each year. What causes Hodgkin lymphoma? The exact cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if: you have a medical condition that weakens your immune system you take immunosuppressant medication you've previously been exposed to a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus \u2013 which causes glandular fever You also have an increased risk of developing Hodgkin lymphoma if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had the condition. Read more about the causes of Hodgkin lymphoma. How Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed The only way to confirm a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a biopsy. This is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory. Read more about diagnosing Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment and outlook Hodgkin lymphoma is a relatively aggressive cancer and can quickly spread through the body. Despite this, it's also one of the most easily treated types of cancer. Your recommended treatment plan will depend on your general health and age, because many of the treatments can put a tremendous strain on the body. How far the cancer has spread is also an important factor in determining the best treatment. The main treatments used are chemotherapy, followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Surgery isn't generally used as a treatment for the condition. Overall, around 85% of people with Hodgkin lymphoma live at least five years and most of these will be cured. However, there's a risk of long-term problems after treatment, including infertility and an increased risk of developing another type of cancer in the future.

The term \"congenital\" means the condition is present at birth. Congenital heart disease is one of the most common types of birth defect, affecting up to 9 in every 1,000 babies born in the UK. Why it happens In most cases, no obvious cause of congenital heart disease is identified. However, some things are known to increase the risk of the condition, including: Down's syndrome \u2013 a genetic disorder that affects a baby's normal physical development and causes learning difficulties the mother having certain infections, such as rubella, during pregnancy the mother having poorly controlled type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes other chromosome defects, where genes may be altered from normal and can be inherited  Read more about the causes of congenital heart disease and preventing congenital heart disease. Many cases of congenital heart disease are diagnosed before a baby is born during an ultrasound scan in pregnancy. However, it's not always possible to detect congenital heart defects in this way. Signs and symptoms Congenital heart disease can have a number of symptoms, including: rapid heartbeat rapid breathing excessive sweating extreme tiredness and fatigue a blue tinge to the skin (cyanosis) tiredness and rapid breathing when a baby is feeding  These problems are sometimes noticeable soon after birth, although mild defects may not cause any problems until later in life. Read more about the symptoms of congenital heart disease and diagnosing congenital heart disease. Types of congenital heart disease There are many types of congenital heart disease and they sometimes occur in combination. Some of the more common defects include: septal defects \u2013 where there's a hole between two of the heart's chambers (commonly referred to as a \"hole in the heart\") coarctation of the aorta \u2013 where the main large artery of the body, called the aorta, is narrower than normal pulmonary valve stenosis \u2013 where the pulmonary valve, which controls the flow of blood out of the lower right chamber of the heart to the lungs, is narrower than normal transposition of the great arteries \u2013 where the pulmonary and aortic valves and the arteries they're connected to have swapped positions Read more about the types of congenital heart disease. Treating congenital heart disease Treatment for congenital heart disease usually depends on the defect you or your child has. Mild defects, such as holes in the heart, often don't need to be treated, as they may improve on their own and may not cause any further problems. Surgery or interventional procedures are usually required if the defect is significant and causing problems. Modern surgical techniques can often restore most or all of the heart's normal function, and nowadays about 80% of children with congenital heart disease will survive into adulthood. However, people with congenital heart disease often need treatment throughout their life and therefore require specialist review during childhood and adulthood. This is because people with complex heart problems can develop further problems with their heart rhythm or valves over time. Most surgery and interventional procedures aren't considered to be a cure. The affected person's ability to exercise may be limited, which can progress over time and may lead to the need for further surgery or intervention. Some people with more complex congenital heart disease may not have a normal life span. It's important that a person with heart disease and their parents or carers discuss these issues with their specialist medical team. Read more about treating congenital heart disease and the complications of congenital heart disease. Information about your child If your child has congenital heart disease, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. The heart The heart is divided into four main sections called chambers. These are known as the: left atrium (collects blood returning from the lungs) left ventricle (the main pumping chamber for the body) right atrium (collects blood returning from the body's veins) right ventricle (pumps bloods to the lungs)  There are also four valves controlling how the blood flows through the heart and around the body. These are known as the: mitral valve (separating the left atrium from the left ventricle) aortic valve (separating the left ventricle from the main artery, the aorta) tricuspid valve (separating the right atrium from the right ventricle) pulmonary valve (separating the right ventricle from the pulmonary artery to the lung) Congenital heart disease can occur if any of these chambers or valves doesn't develop properly while a baby is in the womb.

Oxygen treatment may be prescribed for people with a heart or lung condition that causes low oxygen levels in their blood. Low oxygen levels can damage the heart or brain. Therefore, the main aim of oxygen treatment is to increase the amount of oxygen in your lungs and bloodstream to a level that prevents such harm. It can also help relieve breathlessness and other symptoms of low oxygen, such as ankle swelling and blue lips. However, oxygen treatment shouldn't be used for the sole purpose of relieving breathlessness because it can have harmful long-term effects such as making you less fit. It can also cause a delay in finding out what's making you breathless. How oxygen treatment is given Oxygen treatment can be given in a number of ways including through a: tube positioned under the nose (nasal cannula) face mask placed over the nose and mouth tube placed into the mouth and down the windpipe (trachea) of a person who's unable to breathe on their own; the tube is attached to a ventilator machine that helps the person breathe How home oxygen treatment can help If you have a health condition that causes low levels of oxygen in your blood (hypoxia), you may feel breathless and tired, particularly after walking or coughing. Fluid may also build up around your ankles (oedema) and you may have blue lips. Breathing air with a higher concentration of oxygen than normal can increase the amount of oxygen in your blood. This makes it easier to carry out activities that might otherwise be more difficult, and it helps reduce the symptoms mentioned above. Oxygen treatment can help people with a range of health conditions that affect breathing or blood circulation, including: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \u2013 a long-term lung condition severe long-term asthma cystic fibrosis \u2013 an inherited condition that causes the lungs to become clogged with thick, sticky mucus pulmonary hypertension \u2013 high pressure inside the arteries to the lungs, which damages the right-hand side of the heart conditions that affect the nerves and muscles or ribcage heart failure \u2013 when the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure People who have oxygen treatment have different requirements. For example, you may only need oxygen treatment for short periods during the day when you're walking about (ambulatory oxygen), or you may need it for longer periods during the day and night. Oxygen treatment assessment If you have a long-term medical condition and your doctor thinks oxygen treatment might be helpful, you'll be asked to visit your nearest oxygen clinic for an assessment. During the assessment it's likely that the amount of oxygen in your blood will be measured by taking a blood sample from your earlobe or wrist, or attaching a sensor to your finger (a pulse oximetry test). You may also be asked to breathe into a device called a spirometer during a spirometry test. Regular oxygen treatment may be recommended if the amount of oxygen in your blood is low. It's important that home oxygen treatment is only given if test results indicate that it's needed. This is because studies have shown that if oxygen is given just for breathlessness it can cause unnecessary harm. If you decide to have oxygen treatment at home, a healthcare professional at the oxygen clinic will help you work out how much oxygen you\u2019ll need and how long you\u2019ll need it for. They'll also discuss the different ways you can get oxygen at home (see below). You'll be asked to fill in a consent form to get home oxygen treatment. This is because, in order to provide you with the equipment and oxygen, the oxygen clinic will need to share some information about your requirements with other NHS organisations. They'll also need permission to send an engineer to your home to install the equipment and explain how to use it, deliver new supplies of oxygen and check your equipment every so often. Once you've agreed this with the oxygen clinic, they'll complete a home oxygen order form for you. This is similar to a prescription and it's sent to the company delivering your oxygen and equipment. The oxygen equipment will be delivered to your home and installed by one of the oxygen company\u2019s engineers. They'll also explain how it works. Oxygen cylinders If you only need oxygen for short periods to relieve attacks of breathlessness after an illness, you'll probably be prescribed oxygen cylinders. However, this should be regularly reviewed so that the short-term relief doesn't hide more serious underlying heart or lung conditions. If your review shows that your blood oxygen levels are normal, short-term oxygen should be withdrawn. You breathe the oxygen through a face mask or through a soft tube inserted into your nose (nasal cannula). You can talk, eat and drink while using a nasal cannula. Cylinders containing oxygen compressed into liquid form can contain more oxygen than standard cylinders. This type of oxygen supply will last longer and the tank may also be lighter. Oxygen concentrator machine An oxygen concentrator machine is suitable if you would benefit from having oxygen for many hours a day, including while you're asleep. It ensures you have a source of oxygen that never runs out. An oxygen concentrator is a machine that's about 75cm (two-and-a-half feet) high and plugs into your electrical socket. It filters oxygen from the air in the room and delivers it through plastic tubes to a mask or nasal cannula. Long tubing can be fixed around the floor or skirting board of your house, with two points where you can \"plug in\" to the oxygen supply. When the machine is installed, the engineer or nurse will discuss the length of tubing you\u2019ll need. The machine is very quiet and compact, and the engineer will explain how to use it and will answer any questions you have. A back-up oxygen cylinder will also be provided in case the machine breaks down, and regular maintenance checks will be carried out to ensure that the concentrator is always working properly. Portable (ambulatory) oxygen Talk to your specialist if you\u2019d like a small, portable cylinder so you can take oxygen outside your home. You\u2019ll need to be fully assessed to see whether portable oxygen (also known as ambulatory oxygen therapy) is likely to be helpful. Portable oxygen isn't recommended if you have heart failure or if you smoke. Portable cylinders can provide oxygen at a rate of two litres a minute \u2013 some cylinders allow you to increase the amount of oxygen being delivered to up to four litres a minute. The flow required will be determined by your lung specialist or the oxygen service healthcare professional. When full, these cylinders weigh just over 2.3kg (five pounds) and hold just under two hours of oxygen (at a rate of two litres a minute). Going on holiday If you're going on holiday in England or Wales, talk to your supplier to see whether you can make arrangements to have home oxygen supplied to you at your destination. Try to give them as much notice as possible. Check with your doctor before arranging your holiday to check you're well enough to travel. The British Lung Foundation website has advice about going on holiday with a lung condition. Safety Oxygen is a fire hazard and, if you're supplied with home oxygen, it's important to take precautions. For example: never let anyone smoke while you're using oxygen keep oxygen at least six feet away from flames or heat sources, such as gas cookers and gas heaters don't use flammable liquids, such as cleaning fluid, paint thinner or aerosols while you're using oxygen keep a fire extinguisher within easy reach at home install fire alarms and smoke detectors in your home and make sure they're working  inform your local fire brigade that you have oxygen at home keep oxygen cylinders upright to prevent them being damaged The supplier of your home oxygen may inform the local fire service on your behalf to make them aware that there's oxygen in your home. They may also request a risk assessment, even if you don't smoke. Home oxygen suppliers There are four companies in England that provide home oxygen services for the NHS and each covers a certain geographical area. Your oxygen treatment clinic will organise your oxygen supply from one of the suppliers below.

People with COPD have difficulties breathing, primarily due to the narrowing of their airways, this is called airflow obstruction. Typical symptoms of COPD include: increasing breathlessness when active a persistent cough with phlegm frequent chest infections Read more about the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Why does COPD happen? The main cause of COPD is smoking. The likelihood of developing COPD increases the more you smoke and the longer you've been smoking. This is because smoking irritates and inflames the lungs, which results in scarring. Over many years, the inflammation leads to permanent changes in the lung. The walls of the airways thicken and more mucus is produced. Damage to the delicate walls of the air sacs in the lungs causes emphysema and the lungs lose their normal elasticity. The smaller airways also become scarred and narrowed. These changes cause the symptoms of breathlessness, cough and phlegm associated with COPD. Some cases of COPD are caused by fumes, dust, air pollution and genetic disorders, but these are rarer. Read more about the causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Who is affected? COPD is one of the most common respiratory diseases in the UK. It usually only starts to affect people over the age of 35, although most people are not diagnosed until they are in their 50s. It is thought there are more than 3 million people living with the disease in the UK, of which only about 900,000 have been diagnosed. This is because many people who develop symptoms of COPD do not get medical help because they often dismiss their symptoms as a \u2018smoker\u2019s cough\u2019. COPD affects more men than women, although rates in women are increasing. Diagnosis It is important that COPD is diagnosed as early as possible so treatment can be used to try to slow down the deterioration of your lungs. You should see your GP if you have any of the symptoms mentioned above. COPD is usually diagnosed after a consultation with your doctor, which may be followed by breathing tests. Read more about diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Treating COPD Although the damage that has already occurred to your lungs cannot be reversed, you can slow down the progression of the disease. Stopping smoking is particularly effective at doing this. Treatments for COPD usually involve relieving the symptoms with medication, for example by using an inhaler to make breathing easier. Pulmonary rehabilitation may also help increase the amount of exercise you are capable of doing. Surgery is only an option for a small number of people with COPD. Read more about treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Living with COPD COPD can affect your life in many ways, but help is available to reduce its impact. Simple steps such as living in a healthy way, being as active as possible, learning breathing techniques, and taking your medication can help you to reduce the symptoms of COPD. Financial support and advice about relationships and end of life care is also available for people with COPD. Read more about living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Want to know more? British Lung Foundation: COPD Can COPD be prevented? Although COPD causes about 25,000 deaths a year in the UK, severe COPD can usually be prevented by making changes to your lifestyle. If you smoke, stopping is the single most effective way to reduce your risk of getting the condition. Research has shown you are up to four times more likely to succeed in giving up smoking if you use NHS support along with stop-smoking medicines such as patches or gum. Ask your doctor about this, call the NHS Smoking Helpline on 0300 123 1044 or go to the NHS Smokefree website. Also avoid exposure to tobacco smoke as much as possible. Want to know more?

A 2010 House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report on homeopathy said that homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebos, and that the principles on which homeopathy is based are \"scientifically implausible\". This is also the view of the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies. This page covers: What is homeopathy?  Does it work?  Is it available on the NHS?  What should I expect if I try it?  When is it used?  What are the regulation issues?  Is it safe?  What can we conclude from the evidence? What is homeopathy?  Homeopathy is a complementary or alternative medicine (CAM). This means that homeopathy is different in important ways from treatments that are part of conventional Western medicine. It is based on a series of ideas developed in the 1790s by a German doctor called Samuel Hahnemann. A central principle of the \"treatment\" is that \"like cures like\" \u2013 that a substance that causes certain symptoms can also help to remove those symptoms. A second central principle is based around a process of dilution and shaking, called succussion. Practitioners believe that the more a substance is diluted in this way, the greater its power to treat symptoms. Many homeopathic remedies consist of substances that have been diluted many times in water until there is none or almost none of the original substance left. Homeopathy is used to \"treat\" an extremely wide range of conditions, including physical conditions such as asthma and psychological conditions such as depression (see When is it used?). Does it work?  There has been extensive investigation of the effectiveness of homeopathy. There is no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition (see What can we conclude from the evidence?). It is available on the NHS?  Homeopathy is not available on the NHS in all areas of the country. Two NHS hospitals provide homeopathy, and some GP practices also offer it. Homeopathy is usually practised privately and homeopathic remedies are available from pharmacies. The price for an initial consultation with a homeopath can vary from around £20 to £80. Homeopathic tablets or other products usually cost around £4 to £10. What should I expect if I try it?    When you first see a homeopath they will usually ask you about any specific health conditions, but also about your general wellbeing, emotional state, lifestyle and diet. Based on this, the homeopath will decide on the course of  treatment, which most often takes the form of homeopathic remedies given as a pill, capsule or tincture. Your homeopath may recommend that you attend one or more follow-up appointments so the effects of the remedy on your health can be assessed. When is it used?  Homeopathy is used for an extremely wide range of health conditions. Many practitioners believe that homeopathy can help with any condition. Among the most common conditions that people seek homeopathic treatment for are: asthma ear infections hay fever mental health conditions, such as depression, stress and anxiety allergies, such as food allergies dermatitis (an allergic skin condition) arthritis high blood pressure There is no good quality evidence that homeopathy is an effective treatment for these or any other health conditions. Some practitioners also claim that homeopathy can prevent malaria or other diseases. There is no evidence to support this and no scientifically plausible way that homeopathy can prevent diseases. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advises the NHS on proper use of treatments. NICE currently does not recommend that homeopathy should be used in the treatment of any health condition. What are the regulation issues?  There is no legal regulation of homeopathic practitioners in the UK. This means that anyone can practise as a homeopath, even if they have no qualifications or experience. A number of professional associations can help you to find a homeopath who will practise the treatment in a way that is acceptable to you.  Homeopathic organisations in England include: Alliance of Registered Homeopaths  The Society of Homeopaths  British Homeopathic Association  Institute for Complementary and Natural Medicine  Voluntary regulation aims to protect patient safety, but it does not mean that there is scientific evidence that a treatment is effective. Is it safe?  Homeopathic remedies are generally safe and the risk of a serious adverse side effect arising from taking these remedies is thought to be small. Some homeopathic remedies may contain substances that are not safe, or that interfere with the action of other medicines. You should talk to your GP before stopping any treatment prescribed by a doctor or avoiding procedures such as vaccination in favour of homeopathy. What can we conclude from the evidence?  There have been several reviews of the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of homeopathy. The House of Commons Science and Technology Committee said there is no evidence that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition. There is no evidence for the idea that substances that can induce certain symptoms can also help to treat them. There is no evidence for the idea that diluting and shaking substances in water can turn those substances into medicines. The ideas that underpin homeopathy are not accepted by mainstream science, and are not consistent with long-accepted principles on the way that the physical world works. The Committee's 2010 report on homeopathy said the \"like cures like\" principle is \"theoretically weak\", and that this is the \"settled view of medical science\". It is of note, for example, that many homeopathic remedies are diluted to such an extent that there is unlikely to be a single molecule of the original substance remaining in the final remedy. In cases such as these, homeopathic remedies consist of nothing but water. Some homeopaths believe that, due to the succussion process, the original substance leaves an \"imprint\" of itself on the water. But there is no known mechanism by which this can occur. The 2010 report said: \"We consider the notion that ultra-dilutions can maintain an imprint of substances previously dissolved in them to be scientifically implausible.\" Some people who use homeopathy may see an improvement in their health condition due to a phenomenon known as the placebo effect. If you choose health treatments that provide only a placebo effect, you may miss out on other treatments that have been proven to be more effective. Read more about the placebo effect.

It means the body can't process the amino acid methionine. This causes a harmful build-up of substances in the blood and urine. Normally, our bodies break down protein foods like meat and fish into amino acids, which are the \"building blocks\" of protein. Any amino acids that aren't needed are usually broken down and removed from the body. Babies with HCU are unable to fully break down the amino acid methionine, causing a build-up of methionine and a chemical called homocysteine. This can be harmful. Diagnosing homocystinuria At around five days old, babies are now offered newborn blood spot screening to check if they have HCU. This involves pricking your baby's heel to collect drops of blood to test. If HCU is diagnosed, treatment can be given to reduce the risk of serious complications. Treatment may include high doses of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), a special diet, advice and sometimes medication. With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, the majority of children with HCU are able to live healthy lives. However, treatment for HCU must be continued for life. Babies born with HCU don't usually have any symptoms in the first year of their life. But severe symptoms can develop later in life without early treatment. These may include: vision problems, such as severe short-sightedness weak bones (osteoporosis) bone and joint problems a risk of developing blood clots and strokes Some children with untreated HCU are also at risk of brain damage, and their development might be affected. Around 1 in 250,000 children are thought to be affected by HCU. Treating homocystinuria Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) In some babies, it's possible to control the levels of homocysteine with high doses of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). If this works, your child will need to take vitamin B6 supplements for the rest of their life. Diet Children diagnosed with HCU that doesn't respond to vitamin B6 are referred to a specialist metabolic dietitian and given a low-protein diet. This is tailored to reduce the amount of methionine your baby receives. High-protein foods need to be limited, including: meat fish cheese eggs pulses nuts Your dietitian will provide detailed advice and guidance, as your baby still needs some of these foods for healthy growth and development. Breastfeeding and baby milk also need to be monitored and measured, as advised by your dietitian. Special formula milk may be used. The diet will be designed to contain all the vitamins, minerals and other amino acids your baby needs. As your baby moves on to solid foods, your dietitian can explain which low-protein foods are suitable. Some of these may be available on prescription, including low-protein rusks, milk substitutes and low-protein pasta. People with HCU may need to follow a modified diet for the rest of their life. As your child gets older, they'll eventually need to learn how to control their diet and stay in contact with a dietitian for advice and monitoring. Regular blood tests will also be needed to monitor the amount of homocysteine in their blood. Medication Alongside a low-protein diet, your child may be prescribed a medication called betaine to help clear some of the excess homocysteine. Medication for HCU needs to be taken regularly, as directed by your doctor. How homocystinuria is inherited The genetic cause (mutation) responsible for HCU is passed on by parents, who usually don't have any symptoms of the condition. The way this mutation is passed on is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. This means a baby needs to receive two copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition \u2013 one from their mother and one from their father. If the baby only receives one affected gene, they'll just be a carrier of HCU. If you're a carrier of the altered gene and you have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, your baby has: a 25% chance of developing the condition a 50% chance of being a carrier of HCU a 25% chance of receiving a pair of normal genes Although it's not possible to prevent HCU, it's important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition. Any further children you have can be tested for the condition as soon as possible and given appropriate treatment. You may also wish to consider genetic counselling for information and advice about genetic conditions. Information about your child If your child has HCU, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

The hookworm larvae (immature worms) are found in soil that's been contaminated with human faeces. The larvae can infect people if their bare skin comes into contact with the soil \u2013 for example, if you're walking barefoot. Most hookworm infections occur in Africa, the Americas, China and southeast Asia. The hookworm life cycle The larvae and adult worms live in the small intestine (small bowel) of an infected person or animal. If an infected person defecates outside (for example, near bushes or in a field) or if their stools are used as fertiliser, the hookworm eggs in the stools will contaminate the soil. The eggs hatch in the soil after one to two days and release larvae, which are too small to be visible. The larvae develop into a mature form after 5 to 10 days, which can penetrate human skin. The main way people become infected with hookworm is through direct skin contact with contaminated soil, typically when walking barefoot. Children can also become infected after playing in the soil and putting their hands in their mouth. Other ways to become infected include eating raw, unwashed vegetables that are contaminated with hookworm eggs or by drinking contaminated water. Once the larvae have entered the body, they move through the bloodstream into the lungs, airways and throat, where they're swallowed and enter the small intestine. After reaching the small intestine, the larvae mature into adult worms and attach themselves to the intestinal wall, where they can cause blood loss. Most adult worms are expelled from the small intestine after one to two years, although they can sometimes remain for longer. The two main species of hookworm that infect people are Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. Symptoms of a hookworm infection Most people infected with hookworm don't have any symptoms. The larvae of animal hookworms sometimes get into the skin, usually after lying on sand contaminated by animal faeces while on a beach holiday abroad. These larvae are unable to go further into the body, but cause a slowly moving red line to appear on the skin. This is called cutaneous larva migrans and can last several weeks. It's a bit itchy, but doesn't usually cause any harm. People infected with human hookworm larvae occasionally have a less obvious itchy rash for a few days around the area of skin where the larvae penetrated. Respiratory symptoms such as a cough and wheeziness may develop when the larvae reach the lungs, a few weeks after exposure. Severe infections may cause abdominal (tummy) pain, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue and anaemia. Blood loss leading to iron deficiency anaemia and protein loss are the most serious symptoms. Diagnosing and treating a hookworm infection Hookworm infections can be diagnosed by inspecting a stool sample under a microscope in a laboratory and looking for the eggs. If there's an infection, the number of eggs will be counted to see how severe it is. An infection can be treated with anthelmintic (anti-worm) medication, such as albendazole or mebendazole, which your GP can prescribe. You'll need to take the medication for one to three days. The medications are usually effective and have few side effects. Albendazole or another medication called ivermectin can be used to treat a cutaneous larva migrans infection of the skin. If you have anaemia, you may need iron supplements. Folic acid may also be recommended to help replenish your red blood cells. Preventing hookworm infections If you're travelling to a tropical or sub-tropical region of the world where hookworm infections are common, avoid walking barefoot in areas where there may be contaminated soil, and don't touch soil or sand with your bare hands. Good hygiene standards and effective sewage disposal systems are the reason hookworm infections aren't commonly seen in developed countries such as the UK, although they may still be a problem in some Mediterranean countries. An estimated 576-740 million people in the world are infected with hookworm.

It replaces hormones that are at a lower level as you approach the menopause. This page covers: Benefits of HRT How to get started Who can take it Types of HRT Stopping HRT Risks and side effects Alternatives Benefits of HRT The main benefit of HRT is that it can help relieve most of the menopausal symptoms, such as: hot flushes night sweats mood swings vaginal dryness reduced sex drive Many of these symptoms pass in a few years, but they can be very unpleasant and taking HRT can offer relief for many women. It can also help prevent weakening of the bones (osteoporosis), which is more common after the menopause. How to get started on HRT Speak to your GP if you're interested in starting HRT. You can normally begin HRT as soon as you start experiencing menopausal symptoms and won't usually need to have any tests first. Your GP can explain the different types of HRT available and help you choose one that's suitable for you. You'll usually be started off on a low dose, which can be increased at a later stage. It may take a few weeks to feel the effects of treatment and there may be some side effects at first. Your GP will normally recommend trying treatment for three months to see if it helps. If it doesn't, they may suggest changing your dose or changing the type of HRT you're taking. Who can take HRT Most women can have HRT if they're experiencing symptoms associated with the menopause. But HRT may not be suitable if you: have a history of breast cancer, ovarian cancer or womb cancer have a history of blood clots have untreated high blood pressure \u2013 your blood pressure will need to be controlled before you can start HRT have liver disease are pregnant \u2013 it's still possible to get pregnant while on HRT, so you should use contraception until two years after your last period if you're under 50 or for one year after the age of 50 In these circumstances, alternatives to HRT may be recommended instead. Types of HRT There are many different types of HRT and finding the right one for you can be tricky. There are different: HRT hormones \u2013 most women take a combination of the hormones oestrogen and progestogen, although women who don't have a womb can take oestrogen on its own  ways of taking HRT \u2013 including tablets, skin patches, gels and vaginal creams, pessaries or rings HRT treatment regimens \u2013 HRT medication may be taken continuously without a break, or in cycles where you take oestrogen continuously and only take progestogen every few weeks Your GP can give you advice to help you choose which type is best for you. You may need to try more than one type before you find one that works best. Read more about the different types of HRT. Stopping HRT There's no limit on how long you can take HRT, but talk to your GP about the duration of treatment they recommend. Most women stop taking it once their menopausal symptoms pass, which is usually after a few years. When you decide to stop, you can choose to do so suddenly or gradually. Gradually decreasing your HRT dose is usually recommended because it's less likely to cause your symptoms to come back in the short term. Contact your GP if you have symptoms that persist for several months after you stop HRT, or if you have particularly severe symptoms. You may need to start HRT again. Risks and side effects of HRT As with any medication, HRT can cause side effects. But these will usually pass within three months of starting treatment. Common side effects include: breast tenderness headaches nausea indigestion abdominal (tummy) pain vaginal bleeding Some types of HRT can also cause a small increase in your risk of certain serious problems, such as blood clots and breast cancer. The benefits of HRT are generally felt to outweigh the risks. But speak to your GP if you have any concerns about taking HRT. Read more about side effects of HRT and risks of HRT. Alternatives to HRT If you're unable to take HRT or decide not to, you may want to consider alternative ways of controlling your menopausal symptoms. Alternatives to HRT include: lifestyle measures \u2013 such as exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, cutting down on coffee, alcohol and spicy foods, and stopping smoking tibolone \u2013 a medication that's similar to combined HRT (oestrogen and progestogen), but may not be as effective and is only suitable for women who had their last period more than a year ago antidepressants \u2013 some antidepressants can help with hot flushes and night sweats, although they can also cause unpleasant side effects such as agitation and dizziness clonidine \u2013 a non-hormonal medicine that may help reduce hot flushes and night sweats in some women, although any benefits are likely to be small Several remedies (such as bioidentical hormones) are claimed to help with menopausal symptoms, but these aren't recommended because it's not clear how safe and effective they are.

Periods usually start to become less frequent over a few months or years before they stop altogether. Sometimes they can stop suddenly. The menopause is a natural part of ageing that usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age, as a woman's oestrogen levels decline. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 51. However, around 1 in 100 women experience the menopause before 40 years of age. This is known as premature menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency. Symptoms of the menopause Most women will experience menopausal symptoms. Some of these can be quite severe and have a significant impact on your everyday activities. Common symptoms include: hot flushes  night sweats vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex difficulty sleeping low mood or anxiety reduced sex drive (libido) problems with memory and concentration Menopausal symptoms can begin months or even years before your periods stop and last around four years after your last period, although some women experience them for much longer. Read more about the symptoms of the menopause. When to see your GP It's worth talking to your GP if you have menopausal symptoms that are troubling you or if you're experiencing symptoms of the menopause before 45 years of age. Your GP can usually confirm whether you are menopausal based on your symptoms, but a blood test to measure your hormone levels may be carried out if you're aged 40 to 45. Blood tests may also be carried out to help diagnose suspected premature menopause if you\u2019re under 40 and have menopausal symptoms. Read more about how your GP can help during the menopause. Treatments for menopausal symptoms Your GP can offer treatments and suggest lifestyle changes if you have severe menopausal symptoms that interfere with your day-to-day life, including: hormone replacement therapy (HRT) \u2013 tablets, skin patches, gels and implants that relieve menopausal symptoms by replacing oestrogen vaginal oestrogen creams, lubricants or moisturisers for vaginal dryness cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013 a type of talking therapy that can help with low mood and anxiety eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly \u2013 maintaining a healthy weight and staying fit and strong can improve some menopausal symptoms Your GP can refer you to a menopause specialist if your symptoms don't improve after trying treatment or if you're unable to take HRT. Read more about treating the menopause. What causes the menopause? The menopause is caused by a change in the balance of the body's sex hormones, which occurs as you get older. It happens when your ovaries stop producing as much of the hormone oestrogen and no longer release an egg each month. Premature or early menopause can occur at any age, and in many cases, there's no clear cause. Sometimes it's caused by a treatment such as surgery to remove the ovaries (oophorectomy), some breast cancer treatments, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or it can be brought on by an underlying medical condition, such as Down's syndrome or Addison's disease.

This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you've been bitten or stung When to get medical advice When to get emergency medical help Prevention Symptoms of insect bites and stings Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Some people have a mild allergic reaction and a larger area of skin around the bite or sting becomes swollen, red and painful. This should pass within a week. Occasionally, a severe allergic reaction can occur, causing symptoms such as breathing difficulties, dizziness and a swollen face or mouth. This requires immediate medical treatment (see below). Read more about the symptoms of common insect bites and stings. What to do if you've been bitten or stung To treat an insect bite or sting: Remove the sting or tick if it's still in the skin (see treating insect bites and stings for advice about how to do this safely). Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they're unlikely to help. The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. Ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments that can help, such as painkillers, creams for itching and antihistamines. Read more about treatments for insect bites and stings.

Prevent insect bites and stings There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin \u2013 repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants \u2013 these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. You may need to take extra precautions if you're travelling to part of the world where there's a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about how to prevent insect bites and stings.

For example, you should: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin \u2013 repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants \u2013 these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. You may need to take extra precautions if you're travelling to part of the world where there's a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about how to prevent insect bites and stings.

Not all women experience hot flushes going through the menopause, but most do. Three out of every four menopausal women have hot flushes. They\u2019re characterised by a sudden feeling of heat which seems to come from nowhere and spreads through your body. They can include sweating, palpitations, and a red flush (blushing), and vary in severity from woman to woman. Some women only have occasional hot flushes which don\u2019t really bother them at all, while others report 20 hot flushes a day, that are uncomfortable, disruptive and embarrassing. Hot flushes usually continue for several years after your last period. But they can carry on for many, many years \u2013 even into your 70s or 80s. They\u2019re probably caused by hormone changes affecting the body\u2019s temperature control. Causes of hot flushes Most women going through a natural menopause experience hot flushes. But there are other causes of hot flushes, including: Breast cancer treatment \u2013 according to Cancer Research UK, seven out of 10 women who\u2019ve had breast cancer treatment have hot flushes, and they tend to be more severe and frequent than those of women going through a natural menopause. This is because chemotherapy and tamoxifen tablets reduce oestrogen levels. Prostate cancer treatment \u2013 men having treatment for prostate cancer can also have hot flushes, sometimes for years. Hormone treatment causes hot flushes in men by lowering the amount of testosterone in their body. Read advice for men with prostate cancer on how to tackle hot flushes. What does a hot flush feel like? Women often describe a hot flush as a creeping feeling of intense warmth that quickly spreads across your whole body and face \u2018right up to your brow\u2019 and which lasts for several minutes. Others say the warmth is similar to the sensation of being under a sun bed, feeling hot \u2018like a furnace\u2019 or as if someone had 'opened a little trap door in my stomach and put a hot coal in\u2019. Watch these videos where women describe what a hot flush feels like. Hot flush triggers Hot flushes can happen without warning throughout the day and night, but there are well-known triggers, including woolly jumpers, especially polo necks; feeling stressed; drinking alcohol or coffee; or eating spicy foods. Treatments for hot flushes Many women learn to live with menopause-related hot flushes, but if they\u2019re really bothering you and interfering with your day-to-day life, talk to your doctor about treatments that may help. The most effective is HRT which usually completely gets rid of hot flushes. But other medicines have been shown to help, including vitamin E supplements, some antidepressants, and a drug called gabapentin, which is usually used to treat seizures. Note that doctors recommend that you don\u2019t take HRT if you've had a hormone dependent cancer such as breast or prostate cancer. Here\u2019s more information on help for hot flushes from your GP. Complementary therapies for hot flushes Women often turn to complementary therapies as a \u2018natural\u2019 way to treat their hot flushes. There have been small studies indicating that acupuncture, soy, black cohosh, red clover, pine bark supplement, folic acid, and evening primrose oil may help reduce hot flushes. However, the research is patchy, the quality of the products can vary considerably, and the long-term safety of these therapies isn't yet known. It\u2019s important to let your doctor know before you take a complementary therapy because it may have side effects (for example liver damage has been reported with black cohosh) or mix badly with prescription medicines (red clover is unsuitable for women taking anticoagulants). Be aware, too, that soy and red clover contain plant oestrogens so may be unsafe for women who have had breast cancer. Read more about complementary therapies and whether they work. Self help remedies for hot flushes Try these everyday tips to ease the overheating: cut out coffee, tea, and stop smoking keep the room cool, use a fan \u2013 electric or handheld \u2013 if necessary if you feel a flush coming on, spray your face with a cool water atomiser or use a cold gel pack (available from pharmacies) wear loose layers of light cotton or silk clothes so you can easily take some clothes off if you overheat have layers of sheets on the bed rather than a duvet so you can remove them as you need to and keep the bedroom cool cut down on alcohol sip cold or iced drinks have a lukewarm shower or bath instead of a hot one change the timing of your medicine. If tamoxifen is causing your hot flushes, Cancer Research UK suggests taking half your dose in the morning and half in the evening Is a hot flush anything to worry about? Hot flushes are generally a harmless symptom of the menopause. But very occasionally they may be a sign of a blood cancer or carcinoid (a type of neuroendocrine tumour). See your doctor if, in addition to hot flushes, you've been unwell with, for example, fatigue, weakness, weight loss or diarrhoea. Now read about the best foods to eat during the menopause.

A bursa is a fluid-filled sac which forms under the skin, usually over the joints, and acts as a cushion between the tendons and bones. The main symptoms of bursitis are pain, swelling and tenderness in the affected area. Any bursa can become inflamed, but bursitis most commonly occurs in the: shoulder elbow  knee (known as housemaid's knee) hip Other areas affected can include the ankle, foot and Achilles tendon (the large tendon that attaches the heel bone to the calf muscle).  What causes bursitis? A bursa can become inflamed through injury or repetitive movement. Your risk of developing bursitis is increased if you regularly take part in physical activities that involve a lot of repetitive movement, for example running (bursitis in the ankle) or playing darts (bursitis in the elbow). People who spend a lot of time kneeling, such as carpet fitters and gardeners, also have an increased risk of developing bursitis in their knee. Less commonly, bursitis can develop as a result of an infection or as a complication of certain conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis. Read more about the causes of bursitis. Treating bursitis Most cases of bursitis can be treated at home. Resting the affected area, using an ice pack (a frozen bag of vegetables wrapped in a tea towel works well) to reduce inflammation, and taking painkillers such as aspirin, paracetamol and ibuprofen will help relieve your symptoms and speed up your recovery. The pain usually improves within a few weeks, but the swelling may take longer to completely disappear. See your GP if your symptoms do not improve after two weeks. Read more about treating bursitis. Preventing bursitis Taking precautions, such as wearing knee pads when kneeling and warming up properly before exercise, may help reduce your risk of getting bursitis.

They act as cushions between two surfaces that rub against each other, such as bones, muscles, joints and tendons.  Each bursa is lined with special cells called synovial cells. The cells produce a liquid that lubricates the body's moving parts and helps reduce friction.

The vaccine protects against cervical cancer. It's usually given to girls in year eight at schools in England. According to Cancer Research UK, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women under the age of 35. In the UK, 2,900 women a year are diagnosed with cervical cancer, that's around eight women every day. Around 970 women died from cervical cancer in 2011 in the UK. It's estimated that about 400 lives could be saved every year in the UK as a result of vaccinating girls before they are infected with HPV. The HPV vaccine is delivered largely through secondary schools, and consists of two injections into the upper arm spaced at least six, and not more than 24 months apart (girls who began vaccination before September 2014 receive three injections). What is HPV? The human papilloma virus (HPV) is the name given to a family of viruses. Different types of HPV are classed as either high risk or low risk, depending on the conditions they can cause. For instance, some types of HPV can cause warts or verrucas. Other types are associated with cervical cancer. In 99% of cases, cervical cancer occurs as a result of a history of infection with high-risk types of HPV. Often, infection with the HPV causes no symptoms.  Read more about HPV. Different types of HPV and what they do There are over 100 different types of HPV, with around 40 types that affect the genital area. Infection with some high-risk types of HPV can cause abnormal tissue growth as well as other cell changes that can lead to cervical cancer. Infection with other types of HPV may cause: genital warts: small growths or skin changes on or around the genital or anal area, these are the most common viral sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the UK skin warts and verrucas vaginal cancer or vulval cancer (although these types of cancer are rare) anal cancer or cancer of the penis some cancers of the head and neck laryngeal papillomas (warts on the voice box or vocal cords) For more information see Why is the HPV vaccine needed? How the HPV vaccine helps A vaccine called Gardasil is used in the national NHS cervical cancer vaccination programme. Gardasil protects against the two types of HPV, between them responsible for more than 70% of cervical cancers in the UK. A bonus of using Gardasil to prevent cervical cancer is that it prevents genital warts too. Which girls should have the HPV vaccination? The HPV vaccine is part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme and is routinely offered to secondary school girls aged 12 and 13. It's a safe vaccine and there are very few girls who aren't suitable for HPV vaccination. However, special precautions may need to be taken for girls with certain health conditions, or who have ever had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Read more about who should have the HPV vaccine. Why is the HPV vaccine given at such a young age? The HPV virus is very common and is easily spread by sexual activity. As much as half the population will be infected at some time in their life. In most cases, the virus doesn't do any harm because your immune system gets rid of the infection. But in some cases, the infection persists and can lead to health problems. Although most girls don't start having sex until after they're 16 years of age, it's important that they are protected against HPV infection early enough and a good time is in the early teenage years. Getting the vaccine as early as possible will protect them in the future. Read more about how to prevent HPV infection. How is the HPV vaccine given? The HPV vaccine is currently given as a series of two injections within a six- to 24-month period. Girls who began their course of HPV vaccination before September 2014 receive three injections. Learn more about how the HPV vaccine is given. How long does the HPV vaccine protect for? Studies have already shown that the vaccine protects against HPV infection for around 10 years, although experts expect protection to be for much longer. Can girls who missed HPV vaccination still have it? Yes, if a girl misses either of her HPV vaccinations, for whatever reason, speak to her nurse or doctor about making another appointment, ideally as close as possible to the original one. Girls can have the HPV vaccination on the NHS up to age of 18. Girls who have the HPV vaccination after the age of 15 will need three doses as the response to two doses is not so good in older girls. Cervical screening and the HPV vaccine Cervical screening is a way of picking up abnormal cells in the cervix before they progress to cancer. It's been shown that early detection and treatment of cervical abnormalities picked up by screening can prevent three-quarters of cervical cancers. The NHS cervical screening programme involves checking women between the ages of 25 and 64 every three to five years for early cervical abnormalities. Regular cervical screening is the best way to identify abnormal cell changes in the cervix. So it's important that all girls who receive the HPV vaccine also have regular cervical screening once they reach the age of 25. Now, read why it's so important for 12-13 year-old girls to receive the HPV vaccination and find out more about the safety of the HPV vaccine.

It typically results in a rash and joint and tummy pain. HSP can affect people of any age, but the majority of cases occur in children under 10. The medical term for inflammation of the blood vessels is vasculitis. Blood vessels throughout the body become irritated and swollen, which can cause problems such as bleeding into the skin (resulting in a rash) and occasionally problems affecting the kidneys and bowel. HSP is not usually serious and most cases get better within a few weeks. Signs and symptoms The main symptoms of HSP are: a skin rash (purpura) that looks like small bruises or reddish-purple spots, usually on the buttocks, around the elbows and on the legs, and sometimes also on the face and upper body pain in the joints such as the knees and ankles, which can also become swollen, tender and warm tummy pain, which can develop suddenly before the rash appears HSP can also cause some other symptoms, including passing blood in your urine or stools, vomiting and diarrhoea. The condition is often associated with a previous infection (see below), so you or your child may initially have symptoms of an infection as well, such as a high temperature (fever) and feeling generally unwell. Possible complications HSP will usually get better on its own without causing any further problems, but occasionally it can lead to potentially serious complications. The main complications associated with HSP are problems affecting the kidneys, which may not occur until several weeks or months after the other symptoms have passed. This can cause: blood in your urine protein in your urine \u2013 you won't be able to see this yourself, but it can sometimes cause your urine to become \"frothy\" high blood pressure (hypertension) swelling (oedema), particularly around the eyes and ankles These symptoms eventually get better in most people, but in a small proportion the kidneys can stop working properly (kidney failure). HSP can also sometimes cause other problems, such as swelling and pain in the testicles (orchitis) or an abnormal folding in the gut (intussusception) that can lead to a blockage in your bowel. What causes HSP? HSP is caused by a problem with your immune system, possibly as a result of a previous infection. It has been known to occur after a bacterial or viral infection of the throat, airways or lungs (respiratory tract infection). HSP cannot be spread from person to person and doesn't usually run in families. Diagnosing HSP Your GP may suspect HSP based on your symptoms and medical history. To confirm a diagnosis, you may need to be referred to a hospital doctor for the following tests: blood tests \u2013 to see how well the kidneys are working, or to look for recent signs of infection urine dipstick test \u2013 this is used to detect traces of blood or protein in the urine, as these are signs of a problem with the kidneys blood pressure tests \u2013 high blood pressure can also be a sign that the kidneys are affected skin biopsy \u2013 a very small sample of skin is sent to the laboratory to be examined under a microscope (this is only usually done if the doctor is not certain whether it is HSP) If kidney problems are suspected, an ultrasound scan of your tummy and kidneys may also be carried out and you may have a kidney biopsy. This is where a small sample of kidney cells are removed using a needle that is inserted into your lower back. Treating HSP HSP is not usually serious. Most people can be treated at home with only occasional appointments to monitor the condition, although in severe cases admission to hospital may be necessary. The rash, joint pain and tummy pain will usually get better over days or weeks without any treatment. Anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen may help relieve joint pain if needed, but you should check with your doctor before using these as they shouldn't be taken by people with kidney or bowel problems. Paracetamol may be a suitable alternative and resting can also help. A steroid medication such as prednisolone can sometimes help severe tummy pain. Follow-up Due to the risk of kidney problems, you or your child's urine and blood pressure will need to be tested regularly during and after treatment. This may be done during trips to your GP or visits from a community nurse, although you may sometimes be asked to check your child's urine yourself and seek further advice if the results suggest there is a problem.  The exact timing of these tests can vary, but they will usually start off being daily (if testing is done at home) or weekly at first and become less frequent over time. If no problems develop, monitoring can usually stop after around six months. If any problems are detected, you or your child will be referred to a specialist for further tests and any necessary treatment. Testing your or your child's urine If you are asked to check your or your child's urine, you will be given containers to use and a special dipstick that detects small amounts of blood or protein in urine. Your doctor or a nurse will tell you how to use these and how often a urine sample should be tested. You'll need to collect a urine sample first thing in the morning, as this gives the most accurate reading. Your doctor or nurse will talk to you about what the results of the test mean and what you should do if they suggest there is a problem. When to seek medical advice Regardless of your dipstick results, you should contact your GP, nurse or hospital if you or your child: pass red, rusty or blood-coloured urine pass stools with blood in them develop very painful and swollen joints develop severe tummy pain have swollen or painful testicles Outlook HSP usually gets better on its own within about four to six weeks and doesn't generally cause any lasting problems. However, the condition can sometimes be severe and long-lasting \u2013 particularly in adults \u2013 and some people will get it more than once. Kidney problems usually pass without any complications or need for treatment, but in rare cases kidney failure or permanent kidney damage can develop. This is why it's important to check for any early signs of a problem with regular urine tests, as instructed by your doctor.

This means people with APS are at greater risk of developing conditions such as: deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot that usually develops in the leg arterial thrombosis (a clot in an artery), which can cause a stroke or heart attack blood clots in the brain, leading to problems with balance, mobility, vision, speech and memory Pregnant women with APS also have an increased risk of having a miscarriage, although the exact reasons for this are uncertain. APS doesn't always cause noticeable problems, but some people have general symptoms that can be similar to those of multiple sclerosis (a common condition affecting the central nervous system). Read more about the signs and symptoms of APS. What causes antiphospholipid syndrome? APS is an autoimmune condition. This means the immune system, which usually protects the body from infection and illness, attacks healthy tissue by mistake. In APS, the immune system produces abnormal antibodies called antiphospholipid antibodies. These target proteins attached to fat molecules (phospholipids), which makes the blood more likely to clot. It's not known what causes the immune system to produce abnormal antibodies. As with other autoimmune conditions, genetic, hormonal and environmental factors are thought to play a part. Read more about the causes of APS. Who's affected APS can affect people of all ages, including children and babies. However, most people with APS are aged between 20 and 50, and it affects three to five times as many women as men. It's not clear how many people in the UK have the condition. Diagnosing APS Diagnosing APS can sometimes be tricky, as some of the symptoms are similar to multiple sclerosis. Therefore, blood tests to identify the antibodies responsible for APS are essential in diagnosing the condition. Read more about diagnosing APS. How antiphospholipid syndrome is treated Although there's no cure for APS, the risk of developing blood clots can be greatly reduced if it's correctly diagnosed. An anticoagulant medicine such as warfarin or an antiplatelet such as low-dose aspirin is usually prescribed. These reduce the likelihood of unnecessary blood clots forming but still allow clots to form when you cut yourself. Treatment with these medications can also improve a pregnant woman's chance of having a successful pregnancy. With treatment, it's estimated there's about an 80% chance of having a successful pregnancy. Most people respond well to treatment and can lead normal, healthy lives. However, a small number of people with APS continue to experience blood clots despite extensive treatment. Read more about treating APS. Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome In very rare cases, blood clots can suddenly form throughout the body, resulting in multiple organ failure. This is known as catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). CAPS requires immediate emergency treatment in hospital with high-dose anticoagulants. Read more about catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). Information about you If you have APS, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

However, a curve of more than 45 degrees is considered excessive. Sometimes kyphosis doesn't cause any symptoms other than the back appearing abnormally curved or hunched. However, in some cases the condition causes: back pain and stiffness tenderness of the spine tiredness Back pain can be particularly problematic in adults with kyphosis because the body has to compensate for the spinal abnormality. If you have severe kyphosis, your symptoms may get worse over time. You may also have difficulty breathing and eating. What causes kyphosis? In kyphosis, the normal curve in the middle section of vertebral column (the thoracic vertebrae) is more curved than normal. There are a number of reasons why this might happen, including: poor posture (postural kyphosis) \u2013 slouching, leaning back in chairs and carrying heavy bags can stretch supporting muscles and ligaments, which can increase spinal curvature abnormally shaped vertebrae (Scheuermann\u2019s kyphosis) \u2013 if the vertebrae don't develop properly, they can end up being out of position abnormal development of the spine in the womb (congenital kyphosis) \u2013 if something disrupts the spine's normal development, two or more vertebrae sometimes fuse together age \u2013 as people get older, their spinal curvature can be expected to increase Kyphosis can also develop as a result of a spinal injury. Read more about the causes of kyphosis. Treating kyphosis If you have kyphosis, your treatment depends on how curved your spine is, whether you have any additional symptoms such as back pain, and the underlying causes. Children with kyphosis may be able to be treated using non-surgical methods, such as bracing, to limit the progression of kyphosis as they grow. Treatment for mild kyphosis may not be necessary. Kyphosis rarely requires surgical treatment. It's only needed in some severe cases to correct the curvature of the spine. Read more about treating kyphosis. Emotional issues Older children with kyphosis may become concerned or embarrassed about the effect the condition has on their appearance, or having to wear a back brace. These concerns can affect different children in different ways. Some children can become socially withdrawn and they may be reluctant to take part in activities, such as PE, where their condition may be exposed. There are no easy answers to these problems, but it can sometimes help to reassure your child that their feelings will improve with time. Complications Complications of kyphosis usually only occur in more severe cases. They include: persistent pain that can't be controlled with medication breathing difficulties caused by the spine compressing the lungs and airways Occasionally, people with kyphosis can have difficulties when the nerves running through the spine become compressed or pinched. This can disrupt nerve signals and cause symptoms such as: numbness or weakness in the arms and legs problems with sense of balance loss of normal bladder or bowel control These serious complications require urgent medical attention and surgery would usually be recommended. Can kyphosis be prevented? Postural kyphosis can be prevented by being aware of your posture and by taking care of your back. You should encourage your child to: avoid slouching sit correctly \u2013 sit upright, ensuring that the small of the back is supported avoid carrying heavy schoolbags that can pull on the back muscles and ligaments; the best schoolbags are well-designed backpacks take regular exercise (see below) to help strengthen the back and keep it flexible; activities such as swimming, running, walking, yoga and pilates are ideal for helping to prevent back problems Further information: Physical activity guidelines for children under five years of age Physical activity guidelines for children and young people Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 19\/09\/2015 Next review due: 19\/09\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

This brain damage gets progressively worse over time and can affect movement, cognition (perception, awareness, thinking, judgement) and behaviour. Early features can include personality changes, mood swings, fidgety movements, irritability and altered behaviour, although these are often overlooked and attributed to something else. Read more about the features of Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease was originally called Huntington's chorea (\"chorea\" is the Greek word for dancing). This is because the involuntary movements associated with the condition can look like jerky dancing. However, \"disease\" is now the preferred term, because the condition involves a lot more than just abnormal movements. Huntington's disease is caused by an inherited faulty gene. However, in around 3% of cases, there's no family history of the condition, normally because the parents died at a young age. Read more about the cause of Huntington's disease. Diagnosing Huntington's disease If you have symptoms of Huntington's disease, your GP will refer you to a specialist clinician (usually a neurologist) if they feel your symptoms need further investigation. The specialist will ask about your symptoms to assess how likely it is that you have Huntington's disease and to rule out similar conditions. They may also test a number of physical functions, such as your eye movements, balance, control, movement and walking. Your speech and cognition may also be tested. All of these can be affected by Huntington's disease. Genetic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Read more about how Huntington's disease is diagnosed. Treating Huntington's disease There's no cure for Huntington's disease and its progress can't be reversed or slowed down. As the condition progresses, it may put a strain on family and relationships. Treatments for Huntington's disease aim to improve any mood disturbance; this is done to maintain skills used in daily living that can deteriorate over time. Medication can help manage some of the symptoms, such as irritability or excessive movement. Therapies such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy can help with communication and day-to-day living. Support is also available for the family of a person with Huntington's disease. This includes, for example, testing family members who don't have any of the condition's features (manifest) to see whether they carry the gene, or help with choosing a suitable care home in advanced cases. Read more about how Huntington's disease is treated and living with Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease usually progresses and gets worse over a 10-25 year period from when it first appears, before the person eventually dies from it. During the condition's later stages, the person will be totally dependent and need full nursing care. Death is usually from a secondary cause, such as heart failure, pneumonia or another infection. Who's affected by Huntington's disease? Both men and women with a family history of Huntington's disease can inherit the condition. Symptoms usually start to appear during adulthood.  Juvenile (children's) Huntington's disease develops before the age of 20. Only 5-10% of people with Huntington's disease develop it at a very young age, and the pattern of features may be different. It was previously thought that 4-6 people in a population of 100,000 were affected by Huntington's disease. However, UK research carried out in 2012 found the actual figure for those affected by the condition to be about 12 people per 100,000.   It's thought that the number of people who have the Huntington's gene and are not yet affected is about twice that of those who have symptoms. Current research Research is underway to find disease-modifying medication and new treatments for the features of Huntington's disease. Exciting progress has been made in identifying potential ways of slowing down or halting the condition by \"switching off\" the faulty gene that causes Huntington's disease. See our page on clinical trials for Huntington's disease for details of the clinical trials that are currently running. You can find out more by visiting the European Huntington's Disease Network.

It usually affects premature babies.  NRDS is also known as:  hyaline membrane disease infant respiratory distress syndrome newborn respiratory distress syndrome surfactant deficiency lung disease (SDLD) Despite having a similar name, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) isn't related. ARDS is caused by a serious underlying health condition and can affect people of any age. Why it happens NRDS most often occurs when there isn't enough surfactant in the lungs. This substance, made up of proteins and fats, helps keep the lungs inflated and prevents parts of the lung called air sacs collapsing. A baby normally begins producing surfactant sometime between weeks 24 and 28 of pregnancy. Most babies produce enough surfactant to breathe normally by week 34. If your baby is born prematurely, they may not have enough surfactant in their lungs. Occasionally, NRDS occurs in babies that aren't born prematurely. This is usually caused by other risk factors, such as: the mother having diabetes the baby being underweight poor lung development, which can be caused by a variety of illnesses Problems with the genes can play a role in lung development, but this is very rare. It's estimated half of all babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy will develop NRDS. However, this has reduced in recent years, as steroid injections can be given to mothers at risk of NRDS during premature labour. Signs and symptoms The signs of NRDS are often noticeable immediately after birth and get worse over the following few days. They can include: blue-coloured lips, fingers and toes rapid, shallow breathing flaring nostrils a grunting sound when breathing As premature babies are usually born in hospital, most babies with NRDS are already in hospital when they develop these problems and receive treatment. If you give birth outside hospital and notice the above symptoms in your child, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Diagnosing NRDS A number of tests can be used to look for the signs of NRDS and rule out other possible causes. These tests may include: a physical examination blood tests \u2013 to measure the amount of oxygen in the blood and check for an infection a pulse oximetry test \u2013 to measure how much oxygen is being absorbed in the blood, using a sensor attached to the fingertip, ear or toe a chest X-ray \u2013 to look for the distinctive cloudy appearance of NRDS Treating NRDS Most babies with NRDS need breathing help with extra oxygen and possibly some form of ventilator support. Babies needing ventilation can often be treated with a medication directly into the lungs called artificial surfactant, which helps restore normal lung function. Some cases can be prevented or at least made less severe by treating the mother with a medication called betamethasone before birth. Read more about treating NRDS. Complications In the majority of cases NRDS can be treated successfully, and deaths directly linked to NRDS are rare in the UK. However, in more severe cases there's a risk of further problems. These can include scarring to the lungs, leading to longer-term breathing problems. There's also a risk of brain damage, which may result in problems such as learning difficulties.

What happens In a normal pregnancy, the placenta provides nourishment to the developing baby and removes waste products. The placenta is made up of millions of cells known as trophoblastic cells. In a molar pregnancy, these cells behave abnormally as soon as the egg has been fertilised by the sperm. This results in a mass of abnormal cells that can grow as fluid-filled sacs (cysts) with the appearance of white grapes. These cells grow rapidly within the womb, instead of developing into a baby. The abnormal cells are referred to as a \"mole\", which is from the Latin for mass or lump. Molar pregnancy is also called a hydatidiform mole and is a pre-cancerous form of gestational trophoblastic disease.  Molar pregnancies are caused by an imbalance in genetic material (chromosomes) in the pregnancy. This usually occurs when an egg that contains no genetic information is fertilised by a sperm (a complete molar pregnancy), or when a normal egg is fertilised by two sperm (a partial molar pregnancy). In complete molar pregnancy, the embryo does not develop at all. In a partial molar pregnancy, a foetus can develop but never results in a viable baby, due to the imbalance between the male and female chromosomes. A molar pregnancy is not caused by anything that you or your partner does or does not do. How common is molar pregnancy? Molar pregnancies are rare. About one to three in every 1,000 pregnancies turn out to be molar.  Increased risk Factors that increase the risk of molar pregnancies are thought to include: Age \u2013 complete molar pregnancies are more common in teenage women and women over 45 years old. Age has little or no effect on the risk of partial molar pregnancy.  Previous molar pregnancy \u2013 if you have had one molar pregnancy before, your chance of having another one is around one to two in 100, compared with one in 600 for women who haven't had a molar pregnancy. If you have had two or more molar pregnancies, your risk of having another is around 15-20 in 100.  Ethnicity \u2013 molar pregnancies are most common in Asian countries, such as Taiwan, the Philippines and Japan, and also among Native Americans. However, in recent years, the differences in the incidence of molar pregnancy between these communities and the general population have become less marked.  Types of molar pregnancy There are two main types of molar pregnancy, depending on the balance of chromosomes in the egg. These are: complete moles \u2013 when no normal placental tissue forms and no foetus develops; instead, a mass of abnormal cells grow partial moles \u2013 when some abnormal placental tissue forms along with some abnormal foetus; the foetus cannot develop into a baby In very rare cases, a twin pregnancy can include a normal foetus and a mole. Symptoms and diagnosis There are often no signs that a pregnancy is a molar pregnancy. In most cases, the problem is first spotted during an ultrasound scan, which may be the first pregnancy scan at 10-14 weeks. If there are symptoms, they usually appear between weeks 4 and 12 of pregnancy. The most common symptom is bleeding or losing brown-red fluid from the vagina. Sickness and vomiting may be more severe than in a normal pregnancy. Bleeding usually requires an ultrasound scan. If this scan is abnormal, an evacuation of the uterus is performed. This is when the molar pregnancy is removed, usually with a surgical procedure called suction evacuation. The surgery involves opening your cervix (neck of the womb) with a small tube known as a dilator, and removing any remaining tissue with a suction device. Tissue from the pregnancy is then sent to a laboratory to confirm whether it is a molar pregnancy. If a woman has a miscarriage or a termination for other reasons, tissue may be sent to a laboratory for analysis. This may confirm that the pregnancy was molar, even if a molar pregnancy wasn't suspected. Treatment A molar pregnancy usually needs to be removed surgically. This is done with a suction evacuation, under the care of a gynaecologist. In some cases, molar pregnancy can be treated with the removal of the womb (hysterectomy), but this is usually only if you no longer wish to have children. Almost all cases of molar pregnancy are successfully cured. For further information, go to the Charing Cross Hospital Trophoblast Disease Service or the The Sheffield Trophoblastic Disease Centre websites. After treatment Following the mole's removal, some cells will be left in the womb. These cells usually die off over time in around 90% of women. To check the cells have died, all women who have had a molar pregnancy in the UK undergo monitoring of the hormone hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) via the National Trophoblastic Screening Centre's surveillance programme. hCG is the pregnancy test hormone produced by a normal placenta, but also by the mole cells, and is the hormone detected in a pregnancy test. It can also be detected in blood and urine tests. Women on the surveillance programme send in blood or urine samples every two weeks. This is so they can be monitored for signs of persistent trophoblastic disease, which is a risk after all molar pregnancies (see below). Persistent trophoblastic disease needs further treatment with chemotherapy. For further information, go to the Charing Cross Hospital Trophoblast Disease Service or the Sheffield Trophoblastic Disease Centre websites. Hormone monitoring will identify the small number of women who develop a persistent or invasive mole (see below). In these cases, levels of hCG will stay steady or rise, rather than fall. Complications In some cases, the molar disease left after the evacuation of the uterus regrows rather than dies out, and is then known as a persistent disease. This is one of the malignant forms of gestational trophoblastic disease and includes invasive mole and choriocarcinoma. A further suction evacuation may help in a few patients, but chemotherapy is usually necessary to cure the problem. The risk of needing further treatment is: 1 in 10 after a complete molar pregnancy 1 in 100 after a partial molar pregnancy Invasive molar pregnancy is usually treated with chemotherapy in the form of methotrexate and folinic acid. Methotrexate is given as an intramuscular (into the muscle) injection, and folinic acid as a tablet. The injection and tablet are given on alternate days for eight days, followed by a six-day rest period. The eight-day cycle of injections and tablets then begins again. This continues until six weeks after the hCG levels return to normal.  Between one and three in every 100 women may see the condition flare up again, so all women are put into a follow-up programme to monitor their hCG after treatment. Persistent trophoblastic disease is different from normal types of cancer, and the cure rate for women developing it after a molar pregnancy is about 100%. This means that around 100 in 100 women who develop persistent trophoblastic disease after molar pregnancy are cured. There are two treatment centres on in Sheffield and one in London. For further information, go to the Charing Cross Hospital Trophoblast Disease Service or the Sheffield Trophoblastic Disease Centre website. Getting pregnant again It is recommended that you do not get pregnant again until you complete your hCG hormone monitoring, following a molar pregnancy. This normally happens within a few months, but in some cases can take up to a year. Your medical team will discuss this with you. Most women who have chemotherapy treatment for persistent trophoblastic disease will have started their periods again six months after treatment. The Charing Cross Hospital trophoblastic disease treatment team suggest that you do not try to get pregnant again for 12 months after finishing chemotherapy. You can use any method of contraception, including the pill. For an online patient support group with a chat room visit www.mymolarpregnancy.com. Grape-like cysts from a hydatidiform mole  Emotional effects While physical recovery is often relatively quick, it can take longer to recover emotionally from a molar pregnancy. Not only does molar pregnancy involve the loss of a foetus, it also carries the slight risk of a cancerous growth. This can create an enormous emotional strain. Communicating your feelings with your partner, a doctor, a counsellor, or someone else who has gone through a similar experience can be beneficial. There are support groups and forums that can help people handle the stress of a molar pregnancy, such as the Molar Pregnancy Support Group and the Hydatidiform Mole UK Information and Support Service.

The excess fluid puts pressure on the brain, which can damage it. The damage to the brain can cause a wide range of symptoms, including: headache being sick blurred vision difficulty walking Read more about the symptoms of hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus can usually be treated using a piece of equipment known as a shunt. This is a thin tube that's surgically implanted in the brain and drains away the excess fluid. If left untreated, hydrocephalus can be fatal. Read more about how hydrocephalus is treated. What causes hydrocephalus? In the past, hydrocephalus was often referred to as \"water on the brain\". However, the brain isn't surrounded by water but by a special fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF has three important functions, it: protects the brain from damage removes waste products from the brain provides the brain with the nutrients it needs to function properly The brain constantly produces new CSF (about a pint a day), while old fluid is released from the brain and absorbed into the blood vessels. However, if this process is interrupted, the level of CSF can quickly build-up, placing pressure on the brain. Read more about the causes of hydrocephalus. Types of hydrocephalus There are three main types of hydrocephalus: hydrocephalus that's present at birth (congenital hydrocephalus) hydrocephalus that develops after birth (acquired hydrocephalus) hydrocephalus that usually only develops in older people (normal pressure hydrocephalus or NPH) These are described below. Congenital hydrocephalus Congenital hydrocephalus is present in babies when they're born and can be caused by birth defects, such as spina bifida, or as a result of an infection the mother develops during pregnancy, such as mumps or rubella (German measles). It's estimated that spina bifida affects one baby in every 1,000 born in Britain. Most of them will have hydrocephalus. Congenital hydrocephalus carries the risk of long-term mental and physical disabilities as a result of permanent brain damage. Read more about the complications of hydrocephalus. Acquired hydrocephalus Acquired hydrocephalus can affect children or adults. It usually develops after an illness or injury. For example, it may occur after a serious head injury, or as a complication of a medical condition, such as a brain tumour. Normal pressure hydrocephalus Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is an uncommon and poorly understood condition that most often affects people over 60 years of age. It can sometimes develop after an injury or a stroke, but in most cases the cause is unknown. Mobility problems, dementia and urinary incontinence are the main symptoms of NPH, but because they're similar to the symptoms of the other conditions, NPH can be difficult to diagnose.

It can affect people of any age and is sometimes spotted in unborn babies during routine pregnancy ultrasound scans (this is known as antenatal hydronephrosis). Hydronephrosis doesn't generally cause any long-term problems if it's diagnosed and treated promptly. Babies with the condition may not require any treatment at all. However, the condition can increase your chances of getting urinary tract infections (UTIs). In severe cases that are left untreated, the kidney(s) may become scarred, which could lead to loss of kidney function (kidney failure). Hydronephrosis in babies Hydronephrosis is increasingly being found in unborn babies during routine ultrasound scans. This is known as antenatal hydronephrosis. It's estimated to occur in at least 1 in every 100 pregnancies. As a parent, it can be worrying to learn your baby has a problem with their kidneys. However, most cases of hydronephrosis in babies aren't serious and shouldn't affect the outcome of your pregnancy. About four out of every five cases will resolve on their own before or within a few months of birth and will cause no long-term problems for you or your baby. The remaining cases may require treatment with antibiotics to prevent kidney infections, and in some cases surgery may be needed. Read more about diagnosing antenatal hydronephrosis and treating antenatal hydronephrosis. Signs and symptoms Hydronephrosis doesn't always cause symptoms. If it does, these may develop quickly over a few hours or gradually over weeks or months. Symptoms can include: pain in your back or side \u2013 this may be sudden and severe, or may be a dull ache that comes and goes over time; it may get worse after you've drunk a lot symptoms of a UTI, such as a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above, chills and feeling or being sick blood in your urine urinating less often than you used to or with a weak stream in severe cases, noticeably swollen kidneys You should see your GP if you develop severe or persistent pain in your back or side, have symptoms of a UTI, or notice a change in how often you urinate. They may refer you for an ultrasound scan to assess your kidneys. Hydronephrosis in babies doesn't usually cause symptoms, but you should seek medical advice as soon as possible if your child develops signs of a possible UTI, such as a high fever without any other obvious cause. Read more about diagnosing hydronephrosis. What causes hydronephrosis? Hydronephrosis diagnosed in pregnancy is usually mild. It is thought to be caused by an increase in the amount of urine your baby produces in the later stages of pregnancy. In more severe cases, it may be caused by a blockage in the flow of urine from the kidney(s) to the bladder, backflow of urine from the bladder to the kidney(s), or a blockage in the flow of urine out of the bladder. In adults, hydronephrosis is commonly caused by: kidney stones pregnancy an enlarged prostate gland in men narrowing of the ureters (the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder) because of injury, infection or surgery some types of cancer, including kidney cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer or ovarian cancer Read more about the causes of hydronephrosis. Treating hydronephrosis If you have hydronephrosis, your treatment will depend on what's causing the condition and how severe it is. Pregnant women and babies with the condition may not require any treatment. In adults, the first stage of treatment is often to drain the urine out of your kidneys by inserting a tube called a catheter into your bladder or kidney(s). This will help relieve the pressure on your kidneys. Once the pressure has been relieved, the cause of the build-up of urine may need to be treated. The treatments used will depend on why the condition developed. For example: kidney stones may be removed during an operation or broken up using sound waves an enlarged prostate can be treated with medication or surgery to remove some of the prostate blockages in the ureters can be treated using surgery to insert a small tube called a stent cancer may be treated using a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery to remove the cancerous tissue Read more about how hydronephrosis is treated.

It's almost always fatal once symptoms develop, but can be prevented if treatment is given promptly after exposure. In the UK, rabies is not found in the animal population (with the exception of bats) and infections are almost always picked up during travel abroad. When to seek medical help Seek immediate medical advice if you're worried that you or your child may have been bitten, scratched or licked by an animal while abroad, or if you're bitten or scratched by a bat in any country, including the UK. Although rabies is unlikely, you should also seek immediate medical help if you're bitten or scratched by a pet that has travelled abroad and has an uncertain vaccination history. If you've been bitten or scratched, you should: wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water under a running tap for 15 minutes apply antiseptic or alcohol to clean the wound leave the wound open go to the nearest hospital or medical centre and explain that you've been bitten If the incident happens abroad, you should seek local medical help and not wait until you have returned to the UK. How rabies spreads Rabies can be spread to humans from infected animals through a bite, scratch or lick to broken skin, the mouth or the eye. You may also be at risk if an animal spits in your face. In very rare cases, rabies can be spread during an organ transplant. Once it enters the body, the rabies virus multiplies before spreading into nerve endings. It then travels to the spinal cord and brain (the central nervous system). Once the virus is in the central nervous system, it multiplies rapidly and spreads to the salivary glands, lungs, kidneys and other organs. Animals that carry rabies All mammals, including monkeys, can carry the rabies virus, but the following species are more commonly infected: dogs bats raccoons foxes jackals cats mongooses What are the symptoms? It can take a while for symptoms to develop, but when they do the condition is almost always fatal. Symptoms in humans can include: a high temperature (fever) an irrational fear of water (hydrophobia) sensitivity to light (photophobia) fear of drafts of air (aerophobia) confusion or aggressive behaviour Read more about the symptoms of rabies. Treating rabies If you have been exposed (bitten, scratched or licked) by an animal that might have rabies, you'll need to seek medical advice to determine whether you need to have a course of treatment to prevent rabies. This is known as post-exposure treatment. It's important this is done before you develop symptoms. Once symptoms develop, the infection cannot be treated and it's almost always fatal. Post-exposure treatment (preventing rabies) Post-exposure treatment usually involves administering a course of the rabies vaccine, with or without rabies immunoglobulin, in an attempt to prevent the infection spreading to the brain and nervous system. If started promptly, post-exposure treatment is very effective. However, if rabies infection reaches a stage where it causes symptoms, it's almost always fatal. In these cases, treatment will usually focus on making you as comfortable as possible. Rabies can only be diagnosed once you have developed the disease and get symptoms. Various tests, including a skin biopsy, saliva tests or blood tests, can be used to make the diagnosis. Read more about treating rabies. Vaccination A number of vaccines can be used to prevent a rabies infection developing. Routine (pre-exposure) vaccination is usually only recommended if you regularly work with potentially infected animals or are travelling to a part of the world known to have high levels of rabies and limited medical care. A course of rabies vaccine can also prevent rabies from developing after a potential exposure, provided it is started promptly. Before you travel, you should seek advice about whether you need a rabies vaccination. For more information, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) website. Read more about the rabies vaccination. Avoiding rabies When travelling in countries that aren't rabies-free, avoid contact with animals and educate your children about the dangers of petting them. Examine your children regularly for cuts and scratches after contact with any animal and ask how they got them. Make sure they know that being bitten or licked by an animal may be dangerous and they need to tell you about it. It's rare for bat rabies viruses to infect other animals, and the risk of human infection is thought to be low. Nevertheless, if you find an injured bat or a bat that needs to be moved, don't touch it. Call the Bat Conservation Trust helpline on 0345 1300 228 for advice. Quarantine and the Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) To keep countries rabies-free, it's important there are strict public health measures to control stray animals such as foxes. The movement of potentially infected animals across borders into uninfected regions is controlled by strictly enforcing quarantine regulations. Animals that don't have a licence shouldn't be brought into the UK. The Pet Travel Scheme is a system that allows pet dogs, cats and ferrets from certain countries to enter the UK without going into quarantine as long as they have been vaccinated. It also means people in the UK can take their dogs, cats and ferrets to other European Union (EU) countries and return with them to the UK. More information can be found on the GOV.UK website. How common is human rabies? There are an estimated 60,000 deaths from human rabies each year worldwide. Most cases occur in the developing world, particularly in Africa and Asia. As a result of strict UK quarantine laws regarding transporting animals, as well as the introduction of the Pet Travel Scheme, the UK has been rabies-free since the beginning of the 20th century, with the exception of a rabies-like virus in a single species of bat. There have been no cases of human rabies acquired in the UK since 1902, apart from a case of rabies acquired in a bat-handler from an infected bat in 2002. The last recorded case of rabies in the UK was in 2012. The patient, who died, contracted the disease after being bitten by a dog in India.

They don't always cause symptoms and when they do they are often mistaken for another illness. Tapeworm infections are most commonly seen in developing countries and are rare in the UK. Tapeworms are known medically as cestodes. They are usually flat and ribbon-like and made up of segments. Some adult worms grow to 4.5-9m (15-30 feet) in length. Humans can catch them by: touching contaminated faeces (stools) and then placing their hands near their mouth swallowing food or water containing traces of contaminated faeces eating raw contaminated pork, beef or fish Read more about the causes of a tapeworm infection. How do I know if I have a tapeworm? You may not know you have a tapeworm infection until you see segments of the worm in your stools (poo). The segments will look like white grains of rice but sometimes longer sections of the worm may need to be seen by an expert to confirm diagnosis. A tapeworm infection does not always cause symptoms. Or if there are symptoms \u2013 typically stomach pain and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea \u2013 they are often mistaken for another illness. Read more information about the symptoms of a tapeworm infection. See your GP if you see what you think are segments of a tapeworm in your stools. Infection is usually diagnosed from a stool sample but further tests may be needed depending on the type of tapeworm infection. Read more about how tapeworm infections are diagnosed. Treating tapeworm infections If you're diagnosed with a tapeworm infection you'll need treatment to get rid of it. The beef tapeworm lives only in your intestine and is easily treated with tablets. But other tapeworms can lead to serious complications and those that develop as larvae in your body are more difficult to treat. Read more information about treating tapeworm infections and complications of a tapeworm infection. Avoiding tapeworm infections It is important to prepare food properly to avoid a tapeworm infection. Raw meat and fish in particular must be cooked and stored correctly. Vegetables and fruit should be washed thoroughly before they are eaten. Your personal hygiene is even more important if you are in close contact with animals, or travelling in a country where tapeworm infections are more common.

The condition can vary quite a lot. For example, some people find loud noises extremely uncomfortable, some find certain noises particularly annoying, some develop a fear of certain noises, while others experience pain when hearing ordinary sounds. Hyperacusis affects people of all ages and is quite common in children. The condition may just be a minor nuisance for some, but for many it can have a major impact on their life. This page covers: Symptoms of hyperacusis When to get medical help Treatments for hyperacusis Causes of hyperacusis Symptoms of hyperacusis Hyperacusis can either start suddenly or develop gradually over time. When someone with the condition hears noise, they may: feel uncomfortable cover their ears or try to get away from the noise feel angry, tense, distressed, or anxious experience pain \u2013 hyperacusis can be very painful for some people Some people become afraid of sound and avoid noisy situations, causing them to become socially isolated. School and work life can also suffer as it can be very difficult to concentrate. When to get medical help Visit your GP if you have a severe sound intolerance. They can examine your ears and refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) consultant or a hearing specialist (audiologist) for tests if necessary. There are no tests that can definitively diagnose hyperacusis, but you may be asked to fill in a questionnaire about your symptoms and have a hearing test to determine what level of sound causes a reaction. Treatments for hyperacusis There are no specific medicines or operations that can treat hyperacusis, although treating any underlying cause may help resolve the problem. If there's no clear cause, specialist techniques to help reduce your sensitivity to noise may be recommended. These therapies are widely available privately, and may be available on the NHS for people with severe or persistent hyperacusis. They should only be carried out by someone specially trained in the correct techniques. Treatment may involve: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013 this aims to help you explore and change the way you think about the troublesome noises to reduce distress, change your avoidance behaviour, and help you recover from your hyperacusis symptoms   counselling and education \u2013 to support you and help you learn more about your hyperacusis sound therapy (desensitisation) \u2013 this aims to help desensitise your hearing over several months, using special noise generators either placed in the room or in your ears (similar to hearing aids) lifestyle changes \u2013 including learning relaxation techniques, listening to calming music or sounds, not avoiding noisy situations, and not using earplugs or muffs (these may make your ears more sensitive) Recent research suggests patients often feel CBT, counselling and education are the most effective treatments. Some people also found sound therapy helpful, but it wasn't clear whether it provided any additional benefit. You may also find it helpful to get in touch with a support group, such as the British Tinnitus Association and Action on Hearing Loss, to talk to other people with hyperacusis and share your experiences. Causes of hyperacusis The cause of hyperacusis is unclear. It has been linked with a number of other conditions, although many people with hyperacusis don't have any other obvious problems. Hyperacusis has been associated with: tinnitus \u2013 hearing sounds that come from inside your body, rather than from an outside source hearing loss \u2013 the brain may sometimes compensate for reduced hearing by amplifying signals coming from the ears damage to the ear or brain \u2013 including from a head injury, ear surgery, exposure to loud noise, earwax removal, glue ear, and persistent ear infections migraines Bell's palsy \u2013 a type of facial paralysis Ménière's disease \u2013 a disorder of the inner ear that causes a spinning sensation (vertigo), tinnitus, and hearing loss depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Addison's disease \u2013 a rare disorder of the adrenal glands, which sit near the kidneys and produce important hormones disorders affecting the brain \u2013 such as Williams' syndrome or autism spectrum disorder Hyperacusis can also be a side effect of certain medications. If you're taking any medication, check the leaflet it comes with to see if hyperacusis is listed as a possible side effect.

It's mainly made by the liver, but can also be found in some foods. Having an excessively high level of lipids in your blood (hyperlipidemia) can have an effect on your health. High cholesterol itself doesn't usually cause any symptoms, but it increases your risk of serious health conditions. About cholesterol Cholesterol is carried in your blood by proteins. When the two combine, they're called lipoproteins. The two main types of lipoprotein are:  high-density lipoprotein (HDL) \u2013 carries cholesterol away from the cells and back to the liver, where it's either broken down or passed out of the body as a waste product; for this reason, HDL is referred to as \"good cholesterol\", and higher levels are better low-density lipoprotein (LDL) \u2013 carries cholesterol to the cells that need it, but if there's too much cholesterol for the cells to use, it can build up in the artery walls, leading to disease of the arteries; for this reason, LDL is known as \"bad cholesterol\" The amount of cholesterol in the blood \u2013 both HDL and LDL \u2013 can be measured with a blood test. The recommended cholesterol levels in the blood vary between those with a higher or lower risk of developing arterial disease. Why should I lower my cholesterol? Evidence strongly indicates that high cholesterol can increase the risk of: narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)  heart attack  stroke  transient ischaemic attack (TIA) \u2013 often known as a \"mini stroke\" peripheral arterial disease (PAD) This is because cholesterol can build up in the artery wall, restricting the blood flow to your heart, brain and the rest of your body. It also increases the risk of a blood clot developing somewhere in your body. Your risk of developing coronary heart disease also rises as your blood's cholesterol level increases. This can cause pain in your chest or arm during stress or physical activity (angina). What causes high cholesterol? Many factors can increase your chances of having heart problems or a stroke if you have high cholesterol. These include: an unhealthy diet \u2013 in particular, eating high levels of saturated fat smoking \u2013 a chemical found in cigarettes called acrolein stops HDL transporting cholesterol from fatty deposits to the liver, leading to narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) having diabetes or high blood pressure (hypertension) having a family history of stroke or heart disease There's also an inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolaemia, which can cause high cholesterol even in someone who eats healthily. Read more about the causes of high cholesterol. When should my cholesterol levels be tested? Your GP may recommend that you have your blood cholesterol levels tested if you: have been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, stroke or mini stroke (TIA), or peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have a family history of early cardiovascular disease have a close family member who has a cholesterol-related condition are overweight have high blood pressure, diabetes, or a health condition that can increase cholesterol levels Read more about how cholesterol is tested. What should my cholesterol levels be? Blood cholesterol is measured in units called millimoles per litre of blood, often shortened to mmol\/L. As a general guide, total cholesterol levels should be: 5mmol\/L or less for healthy adults 4mmol\/L or less for those at high risk As a general guide, LDL levels should be: 3mmol\/L or less for healthy adults 2mmol\/L or less for those at high risk An ideal level of HDL is above 1mmol\/L. A lower level of HDL can increase your risk of heart disease. Your ratio of total cholesterol to HDL may also be calculated. This is your total cholesterol level divided by your HDL level. Generally, this ratio should be below four, as a higher ratio increases your risk of heart disease. However, cholesterol is only one risk factor and the level at which specific treatment is required will depend on whether other risk factors, such as smoking and high blood pressure, are also present. How can I lower my cholesterol level? The first step in reducing your cholesterol is to maintain a healthy, balanced diet. It's important to keep your diet low in fatty food. You can swap food containing saturated fat for fruit, vegetables and wholegrain cereals. This will also help prevent high cholesterol returning. Other lifestyle changes, such as taking regular exercise and giving up smoking (if you smoke), can also make a big difference in helping to lower your cholesterol. If these measures don't reduce your cholesterol and you continue to have a high risk of developing heart disease, your GP may prescribe a cholesterol-lowering medication, such as statins. Your GP will take into account the risk of any side effects from statins, and the benefit of lowering your cholesterol must outweigh any risks. Read more about how high cholesterol is treated.

Around 7 out of every 10 pregnant women experience nausea and\/or vomiting, and this doesn't just occur in the morning. For most women, this improves or disappears completely by around week 14, although for some women it can last longer. Some pregnant women experience excessive nausea and vomiting. They might be sick many times a day and be unable to keep food or drink down, which can have a negative effect on their daily life. This excessive nausea and vomiting is known as hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), and often needs hospital treatment. Exactly how many pregnant women get HG is not known, as some cases may go unreported, but it's thought to be around 1 in every 100. If you are being sick frequently and can't keep food down, tell your midwife or doctor, or contact the hospital as soon as possible. There is a risk you may become dehydrated, and your midwife or doctor can make sure you get the right treatment. Symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum HG is much worse than the normal nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (\"morning sickness\"). Signs and symptoms of HG include: prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting \u2013 some women report being sick up to 50 times a day dehydration \u2013 not having enough fluids in your body because you can't keep drinks down; if you're drinking less than 500ml a day, you need to seek help ketosis \u2013 a serious condition that results in the build-up of acidic chemicals in the blood and urine; ketones are produced when your body breaks down fat, rather than glucose, for energy weight loss low blood pressure (hypotension) when standing Unlike regular pregnancy sickness, HG may not get better by 14 weeks. It may not clear up completely until the baby is born, although some symptoms may improve at around 20 weeks. See your GP or midwife if you have severe nausea and vomiting, ideally before you start suffering from dehydration and weight loss. There are other conditions that can cause nausea and vomiting, such as appendicitis, and your doctor will need to rule these out first. healthtalk.org has videos and written interviews of women talking about their experiences of hyperemesis gravidarum, and how they coped. What causes hyperemesis gravidarum? It's not known what causes HG, or why some women get it and others don't. Some experts believe that it is linked to the changing hormones in your body that occur during pregnancy. There is some evidence that it runs in families, so if you have a mother or sister who has had HG in a pregnancy, you may be more likely to get it yourself. If you have had HG in a previous pregnancy, you are more likely to get it in your next pregnancy than women who have never had it before, so it's worth planning in advance. Treating hyperemesis gravidarum There are medications that can be used in pregnancy, including the first 12 weeks, to help improve the symptoms of HG. These include anti-sickness (anti-emetic) drugs, vitamins (B6 and B12) and steroids, or combinations of these. Evidence suggests that the earlier you start treatment, the more effective it will be. You may need to try different types of medication until you find what works best for you. If your nausea and vomiting cannot be controlled, you may need to be admitted to hospital. This is so that doctors can assess your condition and give you the right treatment, to protect the health of you and your baby. Treatment can include intravenous fluids, which are given directly into a vein through a drip. If you have severe vomiting, the anti-sickness drugs may also need to be given via a vein or a muscle. The charity Pregnancy Sickness Support has information and tips on coping with nausea and vomiting, including HG. Will hyperemesis gravidarum harm my baby? HG is unpleasant with dramatic symptoms, but the good news is that it's unlikely to harm your baby, if treated effectively. However, if it causes you to lose weight during pregnancy, there is an increased risk that your baby may be born smaller than expected (have a low birthweight). This is why it's important to be monitored for dehydration. Other symptoms you may experience Pregnancy Sickness Support is in touch with many women who have had HG, and who report having some or all of the following symptoms in addition to the main symptoms listed above:  extremely heightened sense of smell excessive saliva production, known as ptyalism headaches and constipation from dehydration pressure sores from long periods of time in bed episodes of urinary incontinence, due to vomiting combined with pregnancy hormone relaxin If you experience these symptoms, you are not alone. Many women have them and, although they can be distressing, they will go away when the HG stops or the baby is born. How you might feel The nausea and vomiting of HG can have a huge impact on your life, at a time when you were expecting to be enjoying pregnancy and looking forward to the birth of your baby. It can affect you both emotionally and physically. The symptoms not only make your life a misery, but may lead to further health complications, such as depression or tears in your oesophagus. Severe sickness can be exhausting and stop you from doing everyday tasks, such as going to work or even getting out of bed. In addition to feeling very unwell and tired, you might also feel: anxious about going out or being too far from home, in case you need to vomit isolated, because you don't know anyone who understands what it's like to have HG confused as to why this is happening to you unsure whether you can cope with the rest of the pregnancy if you continue to feel very ill If you feel any of these, don't keep it to yourself. Talk to your midwife or doctor, and explain the impact HG is having on your life and how it is making you feel. You could also talk to your partner, family and friends, if you want to. If you want to talk to someone who has been through HG, you can contact Pregnancy Sickness Support. They have a support network across the UK, and can put you in touch with someone who has had HG. Bear in mind that HG is much worse than regular pregnancy sickness \u2013 it is not the result of anything you have or haven't done, and you do need treatment and support. Another pregnancy If you have had HG before, it's likely that you will get it again in another pregnancy. If you decide on another pregnancy, it can help to plan ahead, such as arranging child care so that you can get plenty of rest. Think back to what helped you last time \u2013 for example, specific drinks \u2013 and make sure you implement these measures this time around. Talk to your doctor about starting medication early.   Blood clots and hyperemesis gravidarum Because HG can cause dehydration, there's also an increased risk of having deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot), although this is rare.  If you are dehydrated and immobile, there is treatment that you can be given to prevent blood clots.

It's a common problem for people with diabetes. It can affect people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, as well as pregnant women with gestational diabetes. It can occasionally affect people who don't have diabetes, but usually only people who are seriously ill, such as those who have recently had a stroke or heart attack, or have a severe infection. Hyperglycaemia shouldn't be confused with hypoglycaemia, which is when a person's blood sugar level drops too low. This information focuses on hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes. Is hyperglycaemia serious? The aim of diabetes treatment is to keep blood sugar levels as near to normal as possible. But if you have diabetes, no matter how careful you are, you're likely to experience hyperglycaemia at some point. It's important to be able to recognise and treat hyperglycaemia, as it can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. Occasional mild episodes aren't usually a cause for concern and can be treated quite easily or may return to normal on their own. However, hyperglycaemia can be potentially dangerous if blood sugar levels become very high or stay high for long periods. Very high blood sugar levels can cause life-threatening complications, such as: diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) \u2013 a condition caused by the body needing to break down fat as a source of energy, which can lead to a diabetic coma; this tends to affect people with type 1 diabetes hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) \u2013 severe dehydration caused by the body trying to get rid of excess sugar; this tends to affect people with type 2 diabetes Regularly having high blood sugar levels for long periods of time (over months or years) can result in permanent damage to parts of the body such as the eyes, nerves, kidneys and blood vessels. If you experience hyperglycaemia regularly, speak to your doctor or diabetes care team. You may need to change your treatment or lifestyle to keep your blood sugar levels within a healthy range. Symptoms of hyperglycaemia Symptoms of hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes tend to develop slowly over a few days or weeks. In some cases, there may be no symptoms until the blood sugar level is very high. Symptoms of hyperglycaemia include: increased thirst and a dry mouth needing to pee frequently tiredness blurred vision unintentional weight loss recurrent infections, such as thrush, bladder infections (cystitis) and skin infections Symptoms of hyperglycaemia can also be due to undiagnosed diabetes, so see your GP if this applies to you. You can have a test to check for the condition. What should my blood sugar level be? When you're first diagnosed with diabetes, your diabetes care team will usually tell you what your blood sugar level is and what you should aim to get it down to. You may be advised to use a testing device to monitor your blood sugar level regularly at home, or you may have an appointment with a nurse or doctor every few months to see what your level is. Target blood sugar levels differ for everyone, but generally speaking: if you monitor yourself at home \u2013 a normal target is 4-7mmol\/l before eating and under 8.5-9mmol\/l two hours after a meal if you're tested every few months \u2013 a normal target is below 48mmol\/mol (or 6.5% on the older measurement scale) What causes high blood sugar? A variety of things can trigger an increase in blood sugar level in people with diabetes, including: stress an illness, such as a cold eating too much, such as snacking between meals a lack of exercise  dehydration missing a dose of your diabetes medication, or taking an incorrect dose over-treating an episode of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) taking certain medicines, such as steroid medication Occasional episodes of hyperglycaemia can also occur in children and young adults during growth spurts. Treating hyperglycaemia If you've been diagnosed with diabetes and you have symptoms of hyperglycaemia, follow the advice your care team has given you to reduce your blood sugar level. If you're not sure what to do, contact your GP or care team. You may be advised to: change your diet \u2013 for example, you may be advised to avoid foods that cause your blood sugar levels to rise, such as cakes or sugary drinks drink plenty of sugar-free fluids \u2013 this can help if you're dehydrated exercise more often \u2013 gentle, regular exercise such as walking can often lower your blood sugar level, particularly if it helps you lose weight if you use insulin, adjust your dose \u2013 your care team can give you specific advice about how to do this You may also be advised to monitor your blood sugar level more closely, or test your blood or urine for substances called ketones (associated with diabetic ketoacidosis). Until your blood sugar level is back under control, watch out for additional symptoms that could be a sign of a more serious condition (see below). When to get urgent medical attention Contact your diabetes care team immediately if you have a high blood sugar level and experience the following symptoms: feeling or being sick abdominal (tummy) pain  rapid, deep breathing signs of dehydration, such as a headache, dry skin and a weak, rapid heartbeat difficulty staying awake These symptoms could be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis or a hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (see above) and you may need to be looked after in hospital. How to prevent hyperglycaemia There are simple ways to reduce your risk of severe or prolonged hyperglycaemia: Be careful what you eat \u2013 be particularly aware of how snacking and eating sugary foods or carbohydrates can affect your blood sugar level. Stick to your treatment plan \u2013 remember to take your insulin or other diabetes medications as recommended by your care team. Be as active as possible \u2013 getting regular exercise can help stop your blood sugar level rising, but you should check with your doctor first if you're taking diabetes medication, as some medicines can lead to hypoglycaemia if you exercise too much Take extra care when you're ill \u2013 your care team can provide you with some \"sick day rules\" that outline what you can do to keep your blood sugar level under control during an illness. Monitor your blood sugar level \u2013 your care team may suggest using a device to check your level at home, so you can spot an increase early and take steps to stop it.

The sweating may affect the whole of your body, or it may only affect certain areas. Commonly affected areas include the: armpits palms of your hands soles of your feet face and chest groin Both sides of the body are usually affected equally \u2013 for example, both feet or both hands. The sweating doesn't usually pose a serious threat to your health, but it can be embarrassing and distressing. It can also have a negative impact on your quality of life and may lead to feelings of depression and anxiety. Read more about the complications of hyperhidrosis. What is excessive sweating? There are no guidelines to determine what \"normal\" sweating is, but if you feel you sweat too much and your sweating has started to interfere with your everyday daily life, you may have hyperhidrosis. For example, you may have hyperhidrosis if: you avoid physical contact, such as shaking hands, because you feel self-conscious about your sweating you don't take part in activities, such as dancing or exercise, for fear they will make your sweating worse excessive sweating is interfering with your job \u2013 for example, you have difficulty holding tools or using a computer keyboard you're having problems with normal daily activities, such as driving you're spending a significant amount of time coping with sweating \u2013 for example, frequently showering and changing your clothes you become socially withdrawn and self-conscious When to see your GP Visit your GP if you feel that your sweating is interfering with your daily activities, or you suddenly start sweating excessively. Many people with hyperhidrosis are too embarrassed to seek medical help or believe that nothing can be done to improve it. But treatment is available. Also visit your GP if you are having night sweats, because it can sometimes be a sign of something more serious. Your GP will usually be able to diagnose hyperhidrosis based on your symptoms, although occasionally you may need blood and urine tests to check for an underlying cause (see below). What causes hyperhidrosis? In many cases, hyperhidrosis has no obvious cause and is thought to be the result of a problem with the part of the nervous system that controls sweating. This is known as primary hyperhidrosis. Hyperhidrosis that does have an identifiable cause is known as secondary hyperhidrosis. This can have many different triggers, including: pregnancy or the menopause anxiety certain medications low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) infections Read more about the causes of hyperhidrosis. How hyperhidrosis is treated Excessive sweating can be challenging to treat and it may take a while to find a treatment right for you.  Doctors usually recommend starting with the least invasive treatment first, such as powerful antiperspirants. Lifestyle changes may also help, including: wearing loose and light clothes avoiding triggers, such as alcohol and spicy foods, that could make your sweating worse wearing black or white clothes to help minimise the signs of sweating If this doesn\u2019t help, you may be advised to try treatments such as iontophoresis (the affected area is treated with a weak electric current passed through water or a wet pad), botulinum toxin injections, and even surgery in a few cases. Hyperhidrosis is usually a long-term condition, but some people experience an improvement with time and the treatments available can often keep the problem under control. Read more about treating hyperhidrosis. Who is affected Hyperhidrosis is common. It's been estimated to affect between one and three in every 100 people which means there are likely to be hundreds of thousands of people living with it in the UK. Hyperhidrosis can develop at any age, although primary hyperhidrosis typically starts during childhood or soon after puberty.

Symptoms of ADHD tend to be noticed at an early age and may become more noticeable when a child's circumstances change, such as when they start school. Most cases are diagnosed when children are 6 to 12 years old. The symptoms of ADHD usually improve with age, but many adults who are diagnosed with the condition at a young age continue to experience problems. People with ADHD may also have additional problems, such as sleep and anxiety disorders. Read more about the symptoms of ADHD. Getting help  Many children go through phases where they're restless or inattentive. This is often completely normal and doesn't necessarily mean they have ADHD. However, you should consider raising your concerns with your child's teacher, their school's special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) or GP if you think their behaviour may be different to most children their age. It's also a good idea to speak to your GP if you're an adult and you think you may have ADHD, but you weren't diagnosed with the condition as a child. Read more about diagnosing ADHD. What causes ADHD? The exact cause of ADHD is unknown, but the condition has been shown to run in families. Research has also identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD compared to those who don't have the condition. Other factors that have been suggested as potentially having a role in ADHD include: being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) having a low birthweight smoking, alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy ADHD is more common in boys than girls. It's thought that around 2% to 5% of school-aged children may have the condition. ADHD can occur in people of any intellectual ability, although it's more common in people with learning difficulties. Read more about the causes of ADHD. How ADHD is treated Although there's no cure for ADHD, it can be managed with appropriate educational support, advice and support for parents and affected children, alongside medication, if necessary. Medication is often the first treatment offered to adults with ADHD, although psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may also help. Read more about treating ADHD. Living with ADHD Looking after a child with ADHD can be challenging, but it's important to remember that they can't help their behaviour. Some issues that may arise in day-to-day life include: getting your child to sleep at night getting ready for school on time listening to and carrying out instructions being organised social occasions shopping Adults with ADHD may also find they have similar problems, and some may have issues with drugs, crime and employment. Read about living with ADHD for information on ways to cope with these issues.

It's mainly made by the liver, but can also be found in some foods. Having an excessively high level of lipids in your blood (hyperlipidemia) can have an effect on your health. High cholesterol itself doesn't usually cause any symptoms, but it increases your risk of serious health conditions. About cholesterol Cholesterol is carried in your blood by proteins. When the two combine, they're called lipoproteins. The two main types of lipoprotein are:  high-density lipoprotein (HDL) \u2013 carries cholesterol away from the cells and back to the liver, where it's either broken down or passed out of the body as a waste product; for this reason, HDL is referred to as \"good cholesterol\", and higher levels are better low-density lipoprotein (LDL) \u2013 carries cholesterol to the cells that need it, but if there's too much cholesterol for the cells to use, it can build up in the artery walls, leading to disease of the arteries; for this reason, LDL is known as \"bad cholesterol\" The amount of cholesterol in the blood \u2013 both HDL and LDL \u2013 can be measured with a blood test. The recommended cholesterol levels in the blood vary between those with a higher or lower risk of developing arterial disease. Why should I lower my cholesterol? Evidence strongly indicates that high cholesterol can increase the risk of: narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)  heart attack  stroke  transient ischaemic attack (TIA) \u2013 often known as a \"mini stroke\" peripheral arterial disease (PAD) This is because cholesterol can build up in the artery wall, restricting the blood flow to your heart, brain and the rest of your body. It also increases the risk of a blood clot developing somewhere in your body. Your risk of developing coronary heart disease also rises as your blood's cholesterol level increases. This can cause pain in your chest or arm during stress or physical activity (angina). What causes high cholesterol? Many factors can increase your chances of having heart problems or a stroke if you have high cholesterol. These include: an unhealthy diet \u2013 in particular, eating high levels of saturated fat smoking \u2013 a chemical found in cigarettes called acrolein stops HDL transporting cholesterol from fatty deposits to the liver, leading to narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) having diabetes or high blood pressure (hypertension) having a family history of stroke or heart disease There's also an inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolaemia, which can cause high cholesterol even in someone who eats healthily. Read more about the causes of high cholesterol. When should my cholesterol levels be tested? Your GP may recommend that you have your blood cholesterol levels tested if you: have been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, stroke or mini stroke (TIA), or peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have a family history of early cardiovascular disease have a close family member who has a cholesterol-related condition are overweight have high blood pressure, diabetes, or a health condition that can increase cholesterol levels Read more about how cholesterol is tested. What should my cholesterol levels be? Blood cholesterol is measured in units called millimoles per litre of blood, often shortened to mmol\/L. As a general guide, total cholesterol levels should be: 5mmol\/L or less for healthy adults 4mmol\/L or less for those at high risk As a general guide, LDL levels should be: 3mmol\/L or less for healthy adults 2mmol\/L or less for those at high risk An ideal level of HDL is above 1mmol\/L. A lower level of HDL can increase your risk of heart disease. Your ratio of total cholesterol to HDL may also be calculated. This is your total cholesterol level divided by your HDL level. Generally, this ratio should be below four, as a higher ratio increases your risk of heart disease. However, cholesterol is only one risk factor and the level at which specific treatment is required will depend on whether other risk factors, such as smoking and high blood pressure, are also present. How can I lower my cholesterol level? The first step in reducing your cholesterol is to maintain a healthy, balanced diet. It's important to keep your diet low in fatty food. You can swap food containing saturated fat for fruit, vegetables and wholegrain cereals. This will also help prevent high cholesterol returning. Other lifestyle changes, such as taking regular exercise and giving up smoking (if you smoke), can also make a big difference in helping to lower your cholesterol. If these measures don't reduce your cholesterol and you continue to have a high risk of developing heart disease, your GP may prescribe a cholesterol-lowering medication, such as statins. Your GP will take into account the risk of any side effects from statins, and the benefit of lowering your cholesterol must outweigh any risks. Read more about how high cholesterol is treated.

Vision problems such as long-sightedness are often referred to as refractive errors. If you are long-sighted, you will usually be able to see distant objects clearly, but nearby objects will be out of focus. Your eyes may also get tired easily. Read more about the symptoms of long-sightedness. What causes long-sightedness? Long-sightedness occurs when the: eyeball is too short cornea is not curved enough lens is not thick enough The cornea is the transparent layer at the front of the eye, and the lens focuses light on to the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye). There are various causes of long-sightedness, including age, genetics and certain underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes (where there is too much glucose in the blood). Children are sometimes born long-sighted. The problem usually corrects itself as the child's eyes develop. However, it is important for children to have regular eyes tests, because long-sightedness that does not correct itself can lead to other eye-related problems (see below). Adults can also develop long-sightedness, which often becomes more noticeable after the age of 40. Age-related long-sightedness is known as presbyopia. Read more about the causes of long-sightedness. Diagnosing long-sightedness Refractive errors, such as long-sightedness, are usually identified during early eye examinations. Your child will have their eyesight checked regularly as part of the routine screening programme. However, you can have their eyes tested at any time if you are concerned about their vision. Find your nearest optician. In most cases, long-sightedness can be easily corrected; however, if left untreated, it could cause more serious complications that will affect your child's vision permanently (see below). Eye tests for children are free up until the age of 16 (under 19 for those in full-time education). Read more about NHS eye care services and diagnosing long-sightedness. Treating long-sightedness Long-sightedness is often corrected using either glasses or contact lenses. Several surgical techniques have also been developed to treat the condition. Laser surgery is sometimes used, although it is not suitable for everyone. Read more about treating long-sightedness. Complications of long-sightedness In adults, complications of long-sightedness are rare. In children, severe hyperopia can cause them to \"over-focus\", leading to double vision. This, in turn, can lead to two possible eye-related conditions, which are: a squint (strabismus) \u2013 where the eyes are not properly aligned with each other and focus on different things lazy eye (amblyopia) \u2013 where one eye becomes dominant Read more about the complications of long-sightedness.

People with hypermobility are particularly supple and able to move their limbs into positions others find impossible. Joint hypermobility is what some people refer to as having \"loose joints\" or being \"double-jointed\". Joint hypermobility syndrome Many people with hypermobile joints don't have any problems, and some people \u2013 such as ballet dancers, gymnasts and musicians \u2013 may actually benefit from the increased flexibility. However, some people with joint hypermobility can have a number of unpleasant symptoms as well, such as: pain and stiffness in the joints and muscles clicking joints joints that dislocate (come out of the correct position) easily fatigue (extreme tiredness) recurrent injuries \u2013 such as sprains digestive problems \u2013 such as constipation and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) dizziness and fainting thin or stretchy skin If hypermobility occurs alongside symptoms such as these, it is known as joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS). Read more about the symptoms of joint hypermobility and diagnosing joint hypermobility. What causes joint hypermobility? Joint hypermobility is often hereditary (runs in families). One of the main causes is thought to be genetically determined changes to a type of protein called collagen. Collagen is found throughout the body \u2013 for example, in skin and ligaments (the tough bands of connective tissue that link two bones together at a joint). If collagen is weaker than it should be, tissues in the body will be fragile, which can make ligaments and joints loose and stretchy. As a result, the joints can extend further than usual. JHS is widely thought to be a feature of an underlying condition affecting connective tissue called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Read more about the causes of joint hypermobility. Living with joint hypermobility Most people with hypermobile joints won't experience any problems and won't require any medical treatment or support. However, JHS can be very difficult to live with because it can cause such a wide range of symptoms. People with JHS often benefit from a combination of controlled exercise and physiotherapy, as well as additional help to manage pain and make everyday tasks easier. The nature of JHS means that you are at increased risk of injuries, such as dislocations and sprains. Managing the condition may therefore also involve treating short-term injuries as they arise, while following a long-term treatment plan to manage daily symptoms. Read more about treating joint hypermobility. Who is affected Joint hypermobility is thought to be very common, particularly in children and young people. Some estimates suggest that around one in every five people in the UK may have hypermobile joints. In many cases, the joints become stiffer with age, although joint hypermobility and its associated symptoms can continue into adult life. It's not known how many people have JHS in the UK, as the condition is often not recognised or is misdiagnosed. It's thought to be more common in females than males, and less common in white people than those of other ethnic backgrounds.

Vision problems such as long-sightedness are often referred to as refractive errors. If you are long-sighted, you will usually be able to see distant objects clearly, but nearby objects will be out of focus. Your eyes may also get tired easily. Read more about the symptoms of long-sightedness. What causes long-sightedness? Long-sightedness occurs when the: eyeball is too short cornea is not curved enough lens is not thick enough The cornea is the transparent layer at the front of the eye, and the lens focuses light on to the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye). There are various causes of long-sightedness, including age, genetics and certain underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes (where there is too much glucose in the blood). Children are sometimes born long-sighted. The problem usually corrects itself as the child's eyes develop. However, it is important for children to have regular eyes tests, because long-sightedness that does not correct itself can lead to other eye-related problems (see below). Adults can also develop long-sightedness, which often becomes more noticeable after the age of 40. Age-related long-sightedness is known as presbyopia. Read more about the causes of long-sightedness. Diagnosing long-sightedness Refractive errors, such as long-sightedness, are usually identified during early eye examinations. Your child will have their eyesight checked regularly as part of the routine screening programme. However, you can have their eyes tested at any time if you are concerned about their vision. Find your nearest optician. In most cases, long-sightedness can be easily corrected; however, if left untreated, it could cause more serious complications that will affect your child's vision permanently (see below). Eye tests for children are free up until the age of 16 (under 19 for those in full-time education). Read more about NHS eye care services and diagnosing long-sightedness. Treating long-sightedness Long-sightedness is often corrected using either glasses or contact lenses. Several surgical techniques have also been developed to treat the condition. Laser surgery is sometimes used, although it is not suitable for everyone. Read more about treating long-sightedness. Complications of long-sightedness In adults, complications of long-sightedness are rare. In children, severe hyperopia can cause them to \"over-focus\", leading to double vision. This, in turn, can lead to two possible eye-related conditions, which are: a squint (strabismus) \u2013 where the eyes are not properly aligned with each other and focus on different things lazy eye (amblyopia) \u2013 where one eye becomes dominant Read more about the complications of long-sightedness.

Parathyroid glands There are four parathyroid glands, each the size of a grain of rice, in your neck behind the thyroid gland, They produce parathyroid hormone (PTH) which helps control the levels of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D within the bones and blood. This is important because these levels can naturally fluctuate and need to be kept within a healthy range for the body to function properly. For example, calcium levels can rise if you eat a dairy-rich meal, and can fall if you take certain medication. The parathyroid glands are nothing to do with the thyroid gland. 'Parathyroid' means 'near the thyroid'. Parathyroid disorders shouldn't be confused with an underactive thyroid or overactive thyroid. Hypoparathyroidism Hypoparathyroidism means the parathyroid glands produce too little PTH. This causes blood calcium levels to fall (hypocalcaemia) and blood phosphorus levels to rise (hyperphosphataemia). You may need to take supplements for life to restore these levels. Read more about treating hypoparathyroidism. Symptoms The symptoms of hypoparathyroidism vary depending on the cause, the speed at which the condition develops and the effectiveness of treatment. People who develop hypoparathyroidism quickly (for example, after neck surgery) can have the following symptoms: a tingling sensation in the hands or feet or around the mouth (paraesthesia) unusual muscle movements, such as jerking, twitching or muscle spasms muscle cramps  feeling tired, irritable, anxious or depressed People with long-lasting (gradually developing) hypoparathyroidism caused by other medical conditions can also have: eye problems, particularly cataracts dry, thick skin coarse hair that breaks easily and can fall out fingernails that break easily, with ridges that go from left to right It's possible that very low calcium levels can cause fits, but this is rare, particularly if you've had the condition for some time and are being treated with medication. Anxiety can often make you breathe rapidly (hyperventilate). This could make you feel ill and cause your calcium level to fall even further, so it's important to remain calm. Many symptoms listed above aren't specific to hypoparathyroidism. They can also be caused by other conditions. Causes Hypoparathyroidism is most commonly caused by accidental injury to the parathyroid glands during head and neck surgery. In about 12% of people undergoing surgery it lasts for only a short time, with less than 3% having permanent hypoparathyroidism. Other causes include: destruction of the parathyroid glands by the immune system in people with autoimmune diseases, where the body mistakenly attacks its own tissues radiation therapy to the neck for thyroid cancer  surgical removal of the parathyroid glands as a result of cancer low blood magnesium levels \u2013 for example due to alcohol misuse  Who's affected You're more likely to develop hypoparathyroidism if you: have had recent thyroid or neck surgery have a family history of parathyroid disorder have Addison's disease Children or adults with the inherited genetic disorder known as Di-George syndrome will also have hypoparathyroidism because their parathyroid glands are missing at birth. Diagnosis Hypoparathyroidism is diagnosed after a blood test shows: low blood calcium levels low blood PTH levels  high blood phosphorus levels  If you have hypoparathyroidism an electrocardiogram (ECG) may show abnormal heart rhythms and a urine test will show high levels of urinary calcium (too much calcium leaving the body). Treatment Treatment aims to bring the blood levels of calcium and other minerals back to normal. The normal calcium range is around 2.1-2.50 millimoles per litre (mmol\/L). You should aim to maintain your blood calcium levels at 1.80-2.25 mmol\/L. Calcium carbonate and vitamin D supplements \u2013 usually calcitriol (Rocaltrol) or alfacalcidol (One-Alpha) \u2013 can be taken to restore these levels. With the exception of people who have short-lived hypoparathyroidism after neck surgery, these supplements usually have to be taken for life. You'll also need to have regular blood tests to monitor your blood levels. The aim of therapy is to relieve your symptoms and keep calcium in the near-normal or low-normal range. It's also recommended that you follow a high-calcium, low-phosphorus diet. Good sources of calcium include: milk, cheese and other dairy foods green leafy vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage and okra, but not spinach soya beans tofu soya drinks with added calcium nuts bread and anything made with fortified flour fish where you eat the bones, such as sardines and pilchards Phosphorus is found in: red meat dairy foods fish poultry bread rice oats If your blood calcium levels fall to a dangerously low level, or you keep having muscle spasms, you may need to be given calcium through a drip directly into your vein. Your heart rhythm will also be monitored until it's stable. You'll then continue treatment with supplements. Complications Hypoparathyroidism can sometimes lead to: stunted growth poorly developed teeth slow mental development cataracts Sometimes, hypoparathyroidism can occur with other autoimmune conditions, such as Addison's disease and pernicious anaemia. Excessive calcium replacement can cause complications, such as kidney stones. Hyperparathyroidism Hyperparathyroidism is where the parathyroid glands produce too much PTH. This causes blood calcium levels to rise (hypercalcaemia) and blood phosphorus levels to fall (hypophosphataemia). Symptoms Hyperparathyroidism doesn't always cause symptoms. It's often diagnosed while having a blood test for another unrelated problem. When high calcium levels do cause symptoms, they can be mild or general and include: depression  fatigue feeling thirsty and passing a lot of urine feeling sick and losing your appetite muscle weakness  constipation  tummy pain loss of concentration mild confusion  Left untreated, high blood levels of calcium can cause:  vomiting drowsiness dehydration  confusion muscle spasms bone pain or tenderness irregular heart beat high blood pressure (hypertension) In severe cases, high calcium levels can lead to loss of consciousness and coma. They can also cause a number of other possible complications (see below). The severity of your symptoms doesn't always match up to the calcium level in your blood. For example, some people with a slightly raised calcium level may have symptoms while others with high levels can have little or no symptoms. Symptoms depend, in part, on the rate with which calcium levels become raised. Causes There are two main types of hyperparathyroidism. They are: primary \u2013 when one or more of the parathyroid glands is enlarged or overactive, for reasons explained below, and the abnormality causing it is within the gland itself secondary \u2013 when nothing is wrong with the gland, but there's a condition, such as kidney failure or vitamin D deficiency, that lowers calcium; the body reacts by producing extra parathyroid hormone to stop calcium levels from falling to a very low level  Rarely, when secondary hyperparathyroidism goes untreated for too long, the gland remains overactive all the time. This is known as tertiary hyperparathyroidism. It's most commonly seen in people who've had kidney failure for a long time. The main cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a non-cancerous tumour called an adenoma growing on one of the parathyroid glands, causing it to become overactive. Primary hyperparathyroidism may also result from two or more of the glands becoming enlarged (hyperplasia). In rare cases, primary hyperparathyroidism can occur as a result of inherited genes and the diagnosis is made at a younger age. Very rarely, it's caused by cancer of a parathyroid gland. Who's affected Most cases of hyperparathyroidism occur in people with no family history of the condition. Only about 5% of cases can be linked to an inherited problem. Women are twice as likely as men to develop hyperparathyroidism and the risk increases with age. Diagnosis Hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed after a blood test shows: high levels of PTH high levels of blood calcium low levels of phosphorus A DEXA scan (a bone density X-ray) can help detect bone loss, fractures or bone softening, and X-rays, CT scans or ultrasound scans may show calcium deposits or kidney stones. While scans may help plan management, they're not essential for the diagnosis of the condition, which is based on blood tests. Treatment Primary hyperparathyroidism can only be treated with surgery to remove the adenoma from the parathyroid gland. Surgery is effective in curing about 97% of hyperparathyroidism cases. Bisphosphonate medicines are sometimes used to lower very high calcium levels. It's usually given as an intravenous drip (directly into the vein). Bisphosphonates may also be used to treat osteoporosis. Make sure you have a healthy, balanced diet. You don't need to avoid calcium altogether, and a lack of dietary calcium is more likely to lead to a loss of calcium from your skeleton, resulting in brittle bones (osteoporosis). However, you should avoid a high-calcium diet and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration. Treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism depends on the underlying cause. Kidney disease is the most common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism (read more about treating chronic kidney disease). In some people with secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by kidney disease, a tablet called cinacalcet may be used to help control the condition. Complications Complications of hyperparathyroidism are rare but include: osteoporosis and bone fractures kidney stones and blockage, and kidney damage or failure  peptic ulcers  pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) How PTH and vitamin D increase blood calcium If blood calcium levels begin to fall, the parathyroid glands release more parathyroid hormone (PTH) into the blood. PTH, along with calcitriol (vitamin D hormone), causes the: bones to release more calcium into the blood intestines to absorb more calcium from food kidneys to reduce the amount of calcium passed out of the body in urine (and to pass out more phosphate) If blood calcium rises too much, less PTH is released from the parathyroid glands and calcium levels start to fall again. In hypo- and hyperparathyroidism, this system doesn't work properly.

It can have many possible causes, including conditions such as narcolepsy, sleep apnoea or restless legs syndrome; severe sleep deprivation; depression; certain medications (such as tranquillisers); or drug and alcohol misuse. However, some people with hypersomnia will not have an underlying medical condition and there will be no obvious explanation for it \u2013 they have it throughout the day, despite sleeping for a very long time at night. This is known as \"idiopathic\" or primary hypersomnia. The rest of this page focuses on idiopathic hypersomnia.  Signs and symptoms People with idiopathic hypersomnia struggle to stay awake during the day and are usually compelled to take frequent long naps. These may be prolonged or at inappropriate times \u2013 such as during a conversation or meal, or even while driving \u2013 and generally don't provide any relief from the sleepiness. Most people with idiopathic hypersomnia also sleep for more than 10 hours a night and struggle to wake in the morning, because they feel very drowsy and confused upon waking (\"sleep drunkenness\"), although some people sleep for a regular amount of time (about eight hours) and are able to wake relatively normally. The excessive sleepiness may have a negative impact on the person's work, relationships and social life, and they may also: have mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression  have low energy be restless or agitated think or speak slowly have trouble remembering things or maintaining concentration perform behaviours around the house as if on \u201Cautopilot\u201D These symptoms often develop during adolescence or in a person's early twenties, although they can occur earlier or later in life. What to do See your GP if you're constantly drowsy during the day and it's affecting your everyday life. They'll want to know about your sleeping habits, how much sleep you get at night, if you wake during the night, and whether you fall asleep during the day. They will also want to know if you have any emotional problems, such as depression, or if you're taking any medication that could explain your hypersomnia. Your GP may also suggest keeping a diary of your sleeping patterns and sleepiness levels for a few weeks, or filling in a questionnaire called the Epworth sleepiness scale to assess whether you're excessively sleepy during the day. If necessary, your GP can refer you to a doctor specialising in sleep disorders for tests to help diagnose the cause of your symptoms. Seeing a sleep specialist A number of tests can be carried out to assess your sleep and help identify any underlying cause. These are usually carried out at a specialist sleep centre. Two of the main tests used are: Polysomnography (a night time sleep test), which will help rule out sleep disorders such as narcolepsy or sleep apnoea. You stay in a special bedroom and are observed from another room through the night. Electrodes are attached to your face, head and body to record brainwaves, muscle activity, eye movement, breathing and snoring.  Multiple sleep latency test \u2013 this test usually follows the next day. You'll be asked to take several naps throughout the day, so doctors can see how long it takes you to fall asleep when instructed (this shouldn't take longer than eight minutes for someone with hypersomnia). Doctors may diagnose idiopathic hypersomnia if you have excessive daytime sleepiness and need regular daytime naps, but no other cause is found. Managing idiopathic hypersomnia Idiopathic hypersomnia doesn't usually get better by itself. Many people find that the symptoms improve with treatment. Medication There are no medicines specifically designed to treat idiopathic hypersomnia, but medications used for narcolepsy can often help. The main medications used are stimulants, such as modafinil, dexamphetamine and methylphenidate, which help to keep you awake during the day. See treating narcolepsy for more information on these medicines. Antidepressants may be prescribed if emotional problems are interfering with your sleep. A medicine called flumazenil has been shown to help some patients with idiopathic hypersomnia, although more research is needed to be sure of its effectiveness. Lifestyle changes It may also help to adopt good sleeping habits, such as avoiding alcohol, caffeine and medications that make the condition worse, sticking to a bedtime routine, and avoiding working at night or engaging in social activities that delay bedtime. Idiopathic hypersomnia or narcolepsy? Idiopathic hypersomnia is similar to narcolepsy, in that both cause excessive daytime sleepiness and can mean you fall asleep at virtually any time, but there are some key differences:  In narcolepsy, you may lose muscle control when experiencing strong emotions (cataplexy) \u2013 this does not happen in idiopathic hypersomnia. People with narcolepsy often have very vivid dreams and even hallucinations when they are drowsy, which are generally not seen in idiopathic hypersomnia. The overnight sleep in narcolepsy is usually very fragmented and of poor quality, but people with idiopathic hypersomnia tend to sleep continuously through the night. Short daytime naps in narcolepsy tend to be refreshing, but naps in idiopathic hypersomnia are more like long sleeps and are not refreshing. In idiopathic hypersomnia, you don't tend to fall quickly into rapid eye movement (REM) or dream sleep, which is often a key feature in narcolepsy.

But if untreated, it increases your risk of serious problems such as heart attacks and strokes. More than one in four adults in the UK have high blood pressure, although many won't realise it. The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have your blood pressure checked.  This page covers: What is high blood pressure? Health risks Checking your blood pressure Causes Reducing your blood pressure Medication for high blood pressure What is high blood pressure? Blood pressure is recorded with two numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body. The diastolic pressure (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels. They're both measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg). As a general guide: high blood pressure is considered to be 140\/90mmHg or higher ideal blood pressure is considered to be between 90\/60mmHg and 120\/80mmHg low blood pressure is considered to be 90\/60mmHg or lower A blood pressure reading between 120\/80mmHg and 140\/90mmHg could mean you're at risk of developing high blood pressure if you don't take steps to keep your blood pressure under control. Find out more about what your blood pressure result means. Risks of high blood pressure If your blood pressure is too high, it puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes. Persistent high blood pressure can increase your risk of a number of serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as: heart disease heart attacks strokes heart failure peripheral arterial disease aortic aneurysms kidney disease vascular dementia If you have high blood pressure, reducing it even a small amount can help lower your risk of these conditions. Check your blood pressure The only way of knowing whether you have high blood pressure is to have a blood pressure test. All adults over 40 are advised to have their blood pressure checked at least every five years. Getting this done is easy and could save your life. You can get your blood pressure tested at a number of places, including: at your GP surgery at some pharmacies as part of your NHS Health Check in some workplaces You can get your blood pressure checked at your GP practice Results for Edit Find your GP's contact details Your location could not be found.

Causes of high blood pressure It's not always clear what causes high blood pressure, but certain things can increase your risk. You're at an increased risk of high blood pressure if you: are over the age of 65 are overweight or obese are of African or Caribbean descent have a relative with high blood pressure eat too much salt and don't eat enough fruit and vegetables don't do enough exercise drink too much alcohol or coffee (or other caffeine-based drinks) smoke don't get much sleep or have disturbed sleep Making healthy lifestyle changes can help reduce your chances of getting high blood pressure and help lower your blood pressure if it's already high. Read more about the causes of high blood pressure. Reduce your blood pressure The following lifestyle changes can help prevent and lower high blood pressure: reduce the amount of salt you eat and have a generally healthy diet cut back on alcohol if you drink too much lose weight if you're overweight exercise regularly cut down on caffeine stop smoking try to get at least six hours of sleep a night Some people with high blood pressure may also need to take one or more medicines to stop their blood pressure getting too high. Read more about how to keep your blood pressure healthy. Medicines for high blood pressure If you're diagnosed with high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend taking one or more medicines to keep it under control. These usually need to be taken once a day. Common blood pressure medications include: ACE inhibitors \u2013 such as enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) \u2013 such as candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, valsartan and olmesartan calcium channel blockers \u2013 such as amlodipine, felodipine and nifedipine or diltiazem and verapamil. diuretics \u2013 such as indapamide and bendroflumethiazide beta-blockers \u2013 such as atenolol and bisoprolol alpha-blockers \u2013 such as doxazosin renin inhibitors \u2013 such as aliskiren other diuretics \u2013 such as amiloride and spironolactone The medication recommended for you will depend on things like how high your blood pressure is and your age.

Excess levels of thyroid hormones can then speed up the body\u2019s metabolism, triggering a range of symptoms, such as: nervousness and anxiety hyperactivity \u2013 where a person can\u2019t stay still and is full of nervous energy unexplained or unplanned weight loss  swelling of the thyroid gland, which causes a noticeable lump, known as a goitre, to form in the throat The severity, frequency and range of symptoms can vary from person to person. Read more about the symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland. What causes an overactive thyroid gland? The thyroid gland is found in the neck. It produces hormones that are released into the bloodstream to control the body's growth and metabolism. These hormones are called thyroxine and triiodothyronine. They affect processes such as heart rate and body temperature, and help convert food into energy to keep the body going. In hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland produces too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine, which speeds up the body's metabolism. There are several possible underlying causes, the most common being Graves' disease, in which the body's immune system targets the thyroid gland and causes it to produce too much of the thyroid hormones. Read more about the causes of an overactive thyroid gland. Treatment An overactive thyroid usually responds well to treatment, and most people are able to control their symptoms. The three most widely used treatments for an overactive thyroid gland are: thionamides \u2013 a group of medications, including carbimazole and methimazole, that stop the thyroid gland producing too much thyroid hormone radioiodine treatment \u2013 a radioactive substance called iodine that helps shrink the thyroid gland, reducing its activity (the radiation contained in iodine is a very low dose and does not pose a threat to health) surgery \u2013 in a small number of cases surgery may be required to remove some or all of the thyroid gland, particularly if there is a large goitre Beta-blockers may also sometimes be used to temporarily relieve many symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland, although it doesn't target the thyroid gland itself. It's common for treatment to lead to the thyroid not producing enough hormones. This is known as having an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). However, an underactive thyroid is not usually serious and is easily treated. Read more about the treatment of an overactive thyroid gland. Complications Around 1 in 20 people with Graves' disease will also develop symptoms affecting their eyes, such as: double vision  sensitivity to light (photophobia) tearing (excess production of tears) This is known as Graves' ophthalmopathy and should be seen by a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions (an ophthalmologist). A rarer and more serious complication is a sudden and severe flare-up of symptoms, known as a thyroid storm. A thyroid storm can be life-threatening, as it causes severe dehydration and heart problems. Read more about the complications of an overactive thyroid gland. Who is affected Women are 10 times more likely to have an overactive thyroid gland than men. It is estimated that around 1 in 50 women in England currently live with an overactive thyroid gland. In most cases, symptoms will begin somewhere between the ages of 20 and 40, though they can start at any age, including in childhood. An overactive thyroid gland occurs most frequently in white and Asian people, and less frequently in African-Caribbean people.

This affects the heart's ability to pump blood around the body. Some types of cardiomyopathy are inherited and are seen in children and younger people. This page explains the main types of cardiomyopathy: dilated cardiomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy takotsubo cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome' It then explains:  diagnosing cardiomyopathy treating cardiomyopathy information about you Dilated cardiomyopathy In dilated cardiomyopathy the muscle walls of the heart have become stretched and thin, so they can't contract (squeeze) properly to pump blood around the body. How serious is it? If you have dilated cardiomyopathy, you're at greater risk of heart failure, where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure. Heart failure typically causes shortness of breath, extreme tiredness and ankle swelling. Learn more about the symptoms of heart failure. There's also a risk of heart valve problems, an irregular heartbeat and blood clots. You'll need to have regular appointments with your GP so the disease can be monitored. Who's affected? Dilated cardiomyopathy can affect both children and adults.  The heart muscle can become stretched if you have an unhealthy lifestyle or an underlying medical condition, or both. The following can all play a role in the disease: uncontrolled high blood pressure an unhealthy lifestyle \u2013 such as a lack of vitamins and minerals in the diet, heavy drinking and recreational drug use a viral infection that causes inflammation of the heart muscle   a heart valve problem a disease of the body tissues or vessels \u2013 such as Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, lupus, polyarteritis nodosa, vasculitis or muscular dystrophy inheriting a mutated (changed) gene that makes you more vulnerable to the disease pregnancy \u2013 cardiomyopathy can sometimes develop as a complication of pregnancy But for many people, the cause is unknown. More information Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on living with dilated cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle cells have enlarged and the walls of the heart chambers thicken. The chambers are reduced in size so they can't hold much blood, and the walls can't relax properly and may stiffen. How serious is it? Most people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will be able to live a full, normal life. Some people don't even have symptoms and don't need treatment. But that doesn't mean the condition can't be serious. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden unexpected death in childhood and in young athletes. The main heart chambers can become stiff, leading to back pressure on the smaller collecting chambers. This can sometimes worsen the symptoms of heart failure and lead to abnormal heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation). Blood flow from the heart may become reduced or restricted (known as obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Also, the mitral heart valve can become leaky, causing blood to leak backwards. Read more about mitral regurgitation. These heart changes can cause dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath and temporary loss of consciousness. You'll also be at greater risk of developing endocarditis (a heart infection). If you have severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, you'll need to see your doctor regularly so your condition can be monitored. Your doctor will advise about the level and amount of exercise you can do and sensible lifestyle changes to make.  Who's affected? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is thought to affect 1 in 500 people in the UK. Most people inherit the disease from their parents. Read more about how genetic conditions are inherited.   More information Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on living with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy is rare and mostly affects older adults. The walls of the main heart chambers become stiffened and rigid and can't relax properly after contracting. This means the heart can't fill up properly with blood. It results in reduced blood flow from the heart and can lead to symptoms of heart failure, such as breathlessness, tiredness and ankle swelling, as well as heart rhythm problems. In many cases the cause is unknown, although sometimes it can be inherited. More information Read the American Heart Association's leaflet on restrictive cardiomyopathy (PDF, 102kb). Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy In arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), the proteins that normally hold the heart muscle cells together are abnormal. Muscle cells can die and the dead muscle tissue is replaced with fatty and fibrous tissue. The walls of the main heart chambers become thin and stretched, and can't pump blood around the body properly. People with ARVC typically have heart rhythm problems. Reduced blood flow from the heart can also lead to symptoms of heart failure. ARVC is an uncommon inherited condition caused by a mutation (change) in one or more genes. It can affect teenagers or young adults and has been the reason for some sudden unexplained deaths in young athletes. There's increasing evidence that prolonged, strenuous exercise worsens the symptoms of ARVC. It's important that people with or at risk of ARVC have a careful discussion about this with their cardiologist. More information Read the British Heart Foundation's detailed booklet on ARVC. Diagnosing cardiomyopathy Some cases of cardiomyopathy can be diagnosed after various heart scans and tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an echocardiogram. Cardiomyopathy that runs in the family can be diagnosed after a genetic test. If you've been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, you may be advised to have a genetic test to identify the mutation (faulty gene) that caused this. Your relatives can then be tested for the same mutation and, if they have it, their condition can be monitored and managed early. Treating cardiomyopathy  There's no cure for cardiomyopathy, but the treatments described below are usually effective at controlling symptoms and preventing complications. Not everyone with cardiomyopathy will need treatment. Some people only have a mild form of the disease that they can control after making a few lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes If the cause of your cardiomyopathy isn't genetic, it should generally help to: follow a healthy diet and take gentle exercise quit smoking (if you smoke) lose weight (if you're overweight) avoid or reduce your intake of alcohol  get plenty of sleep manage stress make sure any underlying condition, such as diabetes, is well controlled  Medication Medication may be needed to control blood pressure, correct an abnormal heart rhythm, remove excess fluid or prevent blood clots.  Read about: medication for high blood pressure beta-blockers to treat an irregular heartbeat or heart failure diuretics to remove excess fluid from your body if this has caused swelling anticoagulants such as warfarin to prevent blood clots medication to treat heart failure Hospital procedures In some people with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the septum (the wall dividing the left and right side of the heart) is thickened and bulges into the main heart chamber. They may need to have either: an injection of alcohol into their heart \u2013 this is to reduce part of the muscle in the septum a septal myectomy \u2013 heart surgery to remove part of the thickened septum (the mitral valve may be repaired at the same time, if necessary) Those with heart rhythm problems may need to have a pacemaker, or a similar device, implanted to control their abnormal heart rhythm. Read more about having a pacemaker fitted. As a last resort, a heart transplant may be necessary. Information about you If you have cardiomyopathy, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. GOV.UK has more information about the register. Broken heart syndrome Some people who sustain significant emotional or physical stress, such as bereavement or major surgery, go on to experience a temporary heart problem. The heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or \"stunned\", causing the left ventricle (one of the heart's main chambers) to change shape. It may be caused by a surge of hormones, particularly adrenaline, during this period of stress. The main symptoms are chest pain and breathlessness, similar to those of a heart attack \u2013 always call 999 if you or someone else experiences these. The condition \u2013 known medically as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or acute stress cardiomyopathy \u2013 is temporary and reversible. It's unusual for it to happen again.

Hypnosis is widely promoted as a treatment for various long-term conditions and for breaking certain habits. This is despite the fact there's no strong evidence to support these uses. However, hypnosis does seem to have an effect, though scientists disagree about how it works. Some experts see it as a relaxation technique that uses the power of suggestion or relies on the placebo effect. When might it be helpful? Irritable bowel syndrome Some research studies have suggested that hypnotherapy may help with the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), such as abdominal pain. These studies don't provide any strong evidence for its effectiveness, but the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has nevertheless recognised hypnotherapy as a possible treatment for IBS in those who haven't responded to other treatments. Losing weight and quitting smoking There's only limited research evidence that hypnotherapy may help some people to lose weight and to quit smoking, so we can't be certain of its benefit. Read the 2010 Cochrane review on Hypnotherapy for Smoking Cessation and the 2009 Cochrane review on Psychological Interventions for Overweight or Obesity. Skin conditions Some studies suggest that hypnotherapy can be beneficial for childhood eczema. It may also be useful for treating other minor skin conditions, especially those made worse by stress, if used alongside medicine. Anxiety, pregnancy and childbirth Hypnotherapy is widely promoted as a treatment for anxiety, although a systematic review of the effectiveness of hypnosis for the treatment of anxiety found there wasn't enough good evidence to support this.  That said, it has shown some promise in preventing anxiety in pregnancy and relieving pain in labour and childbirth. Bottom line Overall, the evidence supporting the use of hypnotherapy as a treatment in these situations isn't strong enough to make any recommendations for clinical practice. No firm conclusions can be made, because the studies are generally only small and of poor quality. That doesn't mean hypnotherapy won't help you \u2013 but if you wish to try it, be aware of the relevant safety and regulation issues, outlined below. Safety and regulation issues  Hypnotherapy is practised by some doctors, dentists, psychologists and counsellors, but it's also offered by non-professionals with little training. This is because in the UK, hypnotherapists don't have to join any organisation or have any specific training by law. Make sure you choose a qualified hypnotherapist with a solid healthcare background. Most health professionals who practise hypnotherapy belong to a professional organisation such as the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP) and are regulated by the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC). Search for a CNHC-registered hypnotherapist.  You can also find a hypnotherapist by searching the website of the National Hypnotherapy Society. This organisation has a register accredited by the Professional Standards Authority. A private hypnotherapy session can cost anywhere between £50 and £90, although costs will vary across the country. It's unlikely you would get hypnotherapy on the NHS, but it depends on the availability in your area. What to expect You're fully in control when under hypnosis and don't have to take on the therapist's suggestions if you don't want to. If necessary, you can bring yourself out of the hypnotic state. Hypnosis doesn't work if you don't want to be hypnotised. According to Cancer Research UK, most cancer patients say they've had a positive experience with hypnotherapy, although it has made some feel anxious. Read information about hypnotherapy on the Cancer Research UK website. When you shouldn't use hypnotherapy You shouldn't use hypnotherapy if you suffer from psychosis or certain types of personality disorder, as it could make these conditions worse.  If you have any type of mental health problem or serious illness, such as cancer, make sure the hypnotherapist is trained in working with your particular condition. Similarly, children should not be hypnotised by anyone who isn't trained to work with this age group.

But for some people, health worries become overwhelming and a problem in itself. Hypochondria (health anxiety) is excessive worrying about your health, to the point where it causes great distress and affects your everyday life. Some people with health anxiety have a medical condition, which they worry about excessively. Others have medically unexplained symptoms, such as chest pain or headaches, which they are concerned may be a sign of a serious illness, despite the doctor's reassurance. Others may be permanently anxious about their future health, worrying about things like: \"What if I get cancer or heart disease?\" What causes health anxiety? There are many reasons why someone worries too much about their health. You may be going through a particularly stressful period of your life. There may have been illness or death in your family, or another family member may have worried a lot about your health when you were young. Personality can be a factor. You may be vulnerable to health anxiety because you are a worrier generally. You may find it difficult to handle emotions and conflict, and tend to \"catastrophise\" when faced with problems in your life. Sometimes, health anxiety can be a symptom of a mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety disorder, which needs recognising and treating in its own right (see below). Types of health anxiety People with health anxiety can fall into one of two extremes: Constantly seeking information and reassurance \u2013 for example, obsessively researching illnesses from the internet, booking frequent GP appointments, and having frequent tests that don't find any problems. Avoidant behaviour \u2013 avoiding medical TV programmes, GP appointments and anything else that might trigger the anxiety, and avoiding activities such as exercise that are perceived to make the condition worse. Neither of these behaviours are helpful, and need addressing if you are to break the vicious circle of health anxiety. Health anxiety can be a vicious circle If you constantly check your body for signs of illness, such as a rash or bump, you will eventually find something. It often won't be anything serious \u2013 it could be a natural body change, or you could be misinterpreting signs of anxiety (such as increased heart rate and sweating) as signs of a serious condition. However, the discovery tends to cause great anxiety and make you self-check even more. You may find yourself needing more reassurance from doctors, friends and family. The comfort you get from this reassurance may be short-lived, or you may stop believing it, which only means you need more of it to feel better. Seeking reassurance just keeps the symptoms in your head, and usually makes you feel worse. When physical symptoms are triggered or made worse by worrying, it causes even more anxiety, which just worsens the symptoms. Excessive worrying can also lead to panic attacks or even depression. Have I got health anxiety? If you can answer \"yes\" to most of the following questions, it's likely that you are affected by health anxiety and might benefit from talking to your GP. During the past six months: Have you been preoccupied with having a serious illness because of body symptoms, which has lasted at least six months? Have you felt distressed due to this preoccupation? Have you found that this preoccupation impacts negatively on all areas of life, including family life, social life and work? Have you needed to carry out constant self-examination and self-diagnosis? Have you experienced disbelief over a diagnosis from a doctor, or felt you are unconvinced by your doctor's reassurances that you are fine? Do you constantly need reassurance from doctors, family and friends that you are fine, even if you don't really believe what you are being told? How your GP can help Once your GP has established that you do suffer from health anxiety, and there is no serious underlying physical cause for any symptoms you might have, they should investigate whether you might have a problem, such as depression or anxiety disorder, that may be causing or worsening your symptoms.  If this is the case, you may be referred for psychological therapy and you may benefit from antidepressants (see below). If this is not the case, the aim should still be to help you become less worried about your health. You may find that your GP's advice and self-help resources (see below) are all you need to start feeling better, or you may still benefit from a referral for psychological therapy. Psychological therapy Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for many people with health anxiety. It involves working with a trained CBT therapist to identify the thoughts and emotions you experience and the things you do to cope with them, with the aim of changing unhealthy thoughts and behaviours that maintain health anxiety. CBT looks at how to challenge the way you interpret symptoms, to encourage a more balanced and realistic view. It should help you to: learn what seems to make the symptoms worse develop methods of coping with the symptoms keep yourself more active, even if you still have symptoms However, CBT is not the best treatment for everyone with health anxiety. Some people may benefit more from a different psychological therapy, such as trauma-focused therapy or a psychotherapy that will help a particular psychological condition. Accurate assessment is needed to select the right treatment for you and for your problem, so, if necessary, you may be referred to a mental health specialist for this next step.  Medication Antidepressants may be helpful if you have a mental health condition such as depression. For some people, these may work better than CBT. Your GP can directly prescribe antidepressants or refer you to a mental health specialist for treatment. However, treating your symptoms with medication is not always the answer and the possible benefits of medication always need to be weighed against the potential negative effects. Helping yourself There's lots you can do to help yourself. A good first step would be to read the NHS Health Anxiety leaflet, which can be downloaded from the Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS website. This is just one of many self-help guides available. It provides advice and exercises you can try yourself, such as keeping a diary of your preoccupations and symptoms, and counteracting them with realistic and rational thinking.

When your glucose (sugar) level is too low, your body doesn't have enough energy to carry out its activities. Hypoglycaemia is most commonly associated with diabetes, and mainly occurs if someone with diabetes takes too much insulin, misses a meal or exercises too hard. In rare cases, it's possible for a person who doesn't have diabetes to experience hypoglycaemia. It can be triggered by malnutrition, binge drinking or certain conditions, such as Addison's disease. Read more about the causes of hypoglycaemia. Symptoms of hypoglycaemia Most people will have some warning that their blood glucose levels are too low, which gives them time to correct them. Symptoms usually occur when blood sugar levels fall below four millimoles (mmol) per litre. Typical early warning signs are feeling hungry, trembling or shakiness, and sweating. In more severe cases, you may also feel confused and have difficulty concentrating. In very severe cases, a person experiencing hypoglycaemia can lose consciousness. It's also possible for hypoglycaemia to occur during sleep, which can cause excess sweating, disturbed sleep, and feeling tired and confused upon waking. Read more about the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. Correcting hypoglycaemia The immediate treatment for hypoglycaemia is to have some food or drink that contains sugar, such as dextrose tablets or fruit juice, to correct your blood glucose levels. After having something sugary, you may need to have a longer-acting \"starchy\" carbohydrate food, such as a sandwich or a few biscuits. If hypoglycaemia causes a loss of consciousness, an injection of the hormone glucagon can be given to raise blood glucose levels and restore consciousness. This is only if an injection is available and the person giving the injection knows how to use it. You should dial 999 to request an ambulance if: a glucagon injection kit isn't available there's nobody trained to give the injection the injection is ineffective after 10 minutes Never try to put food or drink into the mouth of someone who's drowsy or unconscious as they could choke. This includes some of the high-sugar preparations specifically designed for smearing inside the cheek. Read more about treating hypoglycaemia. Preventing hypoglycaemia If you have diabetes that requires treatment with insulin, the safest way to avoid hypoglycaemia is to regularly check your blood sugar and learn to recognise the early symptoms. Missing meals or snacks or eating less carbohydrate than planned can increase your risk of hypoglycaemia. You should be careful when drinking alcohol as it can also cause hypoglycaemia, sometimes many hours after drinking. Exercise or activity is another potential cause, and you should have a plan for dealing with this, such as eating carbohydrate before, during or after exercise, or adjusting your insulin dose. You should also make sure you regularly change where you inject insulin as the amount of insulin your body absorbs can differ depending on where it's injected. Always carry rapid-acting carbohydrate with you, such as glucose tablets, a carton of fruit juice (one that contains sugar), or some sweets in case you feel symptoms coming on or your blood glucose level is low. Make sure your friends and family know about your diabetes and the risk of hypoglycaemia. It may also help to carry some form of identification that lets people know about your condition in an emergency. When hypoglycaemia occurs as the result of an underlying condition other than diabetes, the condition will need to be treated to prevent a further hypo. Read more about preventing hypoglycaemia. What causes diabetes? The amount of sugar in the blood is normally controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach). When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it's broken down to produce energy. However, in diabetes, the body is unable to break down glucose and convert it into energy. This is because there's either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced doesn't work properly.

Other symptoms common in men this age are: mood swings and irritability loss of muscle mass and reduced ability to exercise fat redistribution, such as developing a large belly or \"man boobs\" (gynaecomastia) a general lack of enthusiasm or energy difficulty sleeping (insomnia) or increased tiredness poor concentration and short-term memory These symptoms can interfere with everyday life and happiness, so it's important to find the underlying cause and work out what can be done to resolve it. Is there such a thing as a 'male menopause'? The \"male menopause\" (sometimes called the \"andropause\") is an unhelpful term sometimes used in the media to explain the above symptoms. This label is misleading because it suggests the symptoms are the result of a sudden drop in testosterone in middle age, similar to what occurs in the female menopause. This isn't true. Although testosterone levels fall as men age, the decline is steady \u2013 less than 2% a year from around the age of 30-40 \u2013 and this is unlikely to cause any problems in itself. A testosterone deficiency that develops later in life (also known as late-onset hypogonadism) can sometimes be responsible for these symptoms, but in many cases the symptoms are nothing to do with hormones. Personal or lifestyle issues  Lifestyle factors or psychological problems are often responsible for many of the symptoms described above. For example, erectile dysfunction, loss of libido and mood swings may be the result of either: stress depression anxiety There are also physical causes of erectile dysfunction, such as changes in the blood vessels, which may happen alongside any psychological cause. Read about the causes of erectile dysfunction. Psychological problems are typically brought on by work or relationship issues, divorce, money problems or worrying about ageing parents. A \"midlife crisis\" can also be responsible. This can happen when men think they've reached life's halfway stage. Anxieties over what they've accomplished so far, either in their job or personal life, can lead to a period of depression. Read more about the male midlife crisis. Other possible causes of the above symptoms include: lack of sleep poor diet lack of exercise drinking too much alcohol smoking low self-esteem Late-onset hypogonadism  In some cases, where lifestyle or psychological problems don't seem to be responsible, the symptoms of the \"male menopause\" may be the result of hypogonadism, where the testes produce few or no hormones. Hypogonadism is sometimes present from birth, which can cause symptoms like delayed puberty and small testes. Hypogonadism can also occasionally develop later in life, particularly in men who are obese or have type 2 diabetes. This is known as late-onset hypogonadism and it can cause the \"male menopause\" symptoms mentioned above. However, this is an uncommon and specific medical condition that isn't a normal part of ageing. A diagnosis of late-onset hypogonadism can usually be made based on your symptoms and the results of blood tests used to measure your testosterone levels. What to do If you're experiencing any of the above symptoms, see your GP. They'll ask about your work and personal life, to see if your symptoms may be caused by a mental health issue, such as stress or anxiety. If stress or anxiety are affecting you, you may benefit from medication or a talking therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Exercise and relaxation can also help. Read about: stress management treating anxiety help for low mood and depression exercise for depression and exercise to relieve stress Do I need HRT? Your GP may also order a blood test to measure your testosterone levels. If the results suggest you have a testosterone deficiency, you may be referred to an endocrinologist (a specialist in hormone problems). If the specialist confirms this diagnosis, you may be offered testosterone replacement to correct the hormone deficiency, which should relieve your symptoms.

Parathyroid glands There are four parathyroid glands, each the size of a grain of rice, in your neck behind the thyroid gland, They produce parathyroid hormone (PTH) which helps control the levels of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D within the bones and blood. This is important because these levels can naturally fluctuate and need to be kept within a healthy range for the body to function properly. For example, calcium levels can rise if you eat a dairy-rich meal, and can fall if you take certain medication. The parathyroid glands are nothing to do with the thyroid gland. 'Parathyroid' means 'near the thyroid'. Parathyroid disorders shouldn't be confused with an underactive thyroid or overactive thyroid. Hypoparathyroidism Hypoparathyroidism means the parathyroid glands produce too little PTH. This causes blood calcium levels to fall (hypocalcaemia) and blood phosphorus levels to rise (hyperphosphataemia). You may need to take supplements for life to restore these levels. Read more about treating hypoparathyroidism. Symptoms The symptoms of hypoparathyroidism vary depending on the cause, the speed at which the condition develops and the effectiveness of treatment. People who develop hypoparathyroidism quickly (for example, after neck surgery) can have the following symptoms: a tingling sensation in the hands or feet or around the mouth (paraesthesia) unusual muscle movements, such as jerking, twitching or muscle spasms muscle cramps  feeling tired, irritable, anxious or depressed People with long-lasting (gradually developing) hypoparathyroidism caused by other medical conditions can also have: eye problems, particularly cataracts dry, thick skin coarse hair that breaks easily and can fall out fingernails that break easily, with ridges that go from left to right It's possible that very low calcium levels can cause fits, but this is rare, particularly if you've had the condition for some time and are being treated with medication. Anxiety can often make you breathe rapidly (hyperventilate). This could make you feel ill and cause your calcium level to fall even further, so it's important to remain calm. Many symptoms listed above aren't specific to hypoparathyroidism. They can also be caused by other conditions. Causes Hypoparathyroidism is most commonly caused by accidental injury to the parathyroid glands during head and neck surgery. In about 12% of people undergoing surgery it lasts for only a short time, with less than 3% having permanent hypoparathyroidism. Other causes include: destruction of the parathyroid glands by the immune system in people with autoimmune diseases, where the body mistakenly attacks its own tissues radiation therapy to the neck for thyroid cancer  surgical removal of the parathyroid glands as a result of cancer low blood magnesium levels \u2013 for example due to alcohol misuse  Who's affected You're more likely to develop hypoparathyroidism if you: have had recent thyroid or neck surgery have a family history of parathyroid disorder have Addison's disease Children or adults with the inherited genetic disorder known as Di-George syndrome will also have hypoparathyroidism because their parathyroid glands are missing at birth. Diagnosis Hypoparathyroidism is diagnosed after a blood test shows: low blood calcium levels low blood PTH levels  high blood phosphorus levels  If you have hypoparathyroidism an electrocardiogram (ECG) may show abnormal heart rhythms and a urine test will show high levels of urinary calcium (too much calcium leaving the body). Treatment Treatment aims to bring the blood levels of calcium and other minerals back to normal. The normal calcium range is around 2.1-2.50 millimoles per litre (mmol\/L). You should aim to maintain your blood calcium levels at 1.80-2.25 mmol\/L. Calcium carbonate and vitamin D supplements \u2013 usually calcitriol (Rocaltrol) or alfacalcidol (One-Alpha) \u2013 can be taken to restore these levels. With the exception of people who have short-lived hypoparathyroidism after neck surgery, these supplements usually have to be taken for life. You'll also need to have regular blood tests to monitor your blood levels. The aim of therapy is to relieve your symptoms and keep calcium in the near-normal or low-normal range. It's also recommended that you follow a high-calcium, low-phosphorus diet. Good sources of calcium include: milk, cheese and other dairy foods green leafy vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage and okra, but not spinach soya beans tofu soya drinks with added calcium nuts bread and anything made with fortified flour fish where you eat the bones, such as sardines and pilchards Phosphorus is found in: red meat dairy foods fish poultry bread rice oats If your blood calcium levels fall to a dangerously low level, or you keep having muscle spasms, you may need to be given calcium through a drip directly into your vein. Your heart rhythm will also be monitored until it's stable. You'll then continue treatment with supplements. Complications Hypoparathyroidism can sometimes lead to: stunted growth poorly developed teeth slow mental development cataracts Sometimes, hypoparathyroidism can occur with other autoimmune conditions, such as Addison's disease and pernicious anaemia. Excessive calcium replacement can cause complications, such as kidney stones. Hyperparathyroidism Hyperparathyroidism is where the parathyroid glands produce too much PTH. This causes blood calcium levels to rise (hypercalcaemia) and blood phosphorus levels to fall (hypophosphataemia). Symptoms Hyperparathyroidism doesn't always cause symptoms. It's often diagnosed while having a blood test for another unrelated problem. When high calcium levels do cause symptoms, they can be mild or general and include: depression  fatigue feeling thirsty and passing a lot of urine feeling sick and losing your appetite muscle weakness  constipation  tummy pain loss of concentration mild confusion  Left untreated, high blood levels of calcium can cause:  vomiting drowsiness dehydration  confusion muscle spasms bone pain or tenderness irregular heart beat high blood pressure (hypertension) In severe cases, high calcium levels can lead to loss of consciousness and coma. They can also cause a number of other possible complications (see below). The severity of your symptoms doesn't always match up to the calcium level in your blood. For example, some people with a slightly raised calcium level may have symptoms while others with high levels can have little or no symptoms. Symptoms depend, in part, on the rate with which calcium levels become raised. Causes There are two main types of hyperparathyroidism. They are: primary \u2013 when one or more of the parathyroid glands is enlarged or overactive, for reasons explained below, and the abnormality causing it is within the gland itself secondary \u2013 when nothing is wrong with the gland, but there's a condition, such as kidney failure or vitamin D deficiency, that lowers calcium; the body reacts by producing extra parathyroid hormone to stop calcium levels from falling to a very low level  Rarely, when secondary hyperparathyroidism goes untreated for too long, the gland remains overactive all the time. This is known as tertiary hyperparathyroidism. It's most commonly seen in people who've had kidney failure for a long time. The main cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a non-cancerous tumour called an adenoma growing on one of the parathyroid glands, causing it to become overactive. Primary hyperparathyroidism may also result from two or more of the glands becoming enlarged (hyperplasia). In rare cases, primary hyperparathyroidism can occur as a result of inherited genes and the diagnosis is made at a younger age. Very rarely, it's caused by cancer of a parathyroid gland. Who's affected Most cases of hyperparathyroidism occur in people with no family history of the condition. Only about 5% of cases can be linked to an inherited problem. Women are twice as likely as men to develop hyperparathyroidism and the risk increases with age. Diagnosis Hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed after a blood test shows: high levels of PTH high levels of blood calcium low levels of phosphorus A DEXA scan (a bone density X-ray) can help detect bone loss, fractures or bone softening, and X-rays, CT scans or ultrasound scans may show calcium deposits or kidney stones. While scans may help plan management, they're not essential for the diagnosis of the condition, which is based on blood tests. Treatment Primary hyperparathyroidism can only be treated with surgery to remove the adenoma from the parathyroid gland. Surgery is effective in curing about 97% of hyperparathyroidism cases. Bisphosphonate medicines are sometimes used to lower very high calcium levels. It's usually given as an intravenous drip (directly into the vein). Bisphosphonates may also be used to treat osteoporosis. Make sure you have a healthy, balanced diet. You don't need to avoid calcium altogether, and a lack of dietary calcium is more likely to lead to a loss of calcium from your skeleton, resulting in brittle bones (osteoporosis). However, you should avoid a high-calcium diet and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration. Treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism depends on the underlying cause. Kidney disease is the most common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism (read more about treating chronic kidney disease). In some people with secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by kidney disease, a tablet called cinacalcet may be used to help control the condition. Complications Complications of hyperparathyroidism are rare but include: osteoporosis and bone fractures kidney stones and blockage, and kidney damage or failure  peptic ulcers  pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) How PTH and vitamin D increase blood calcium If blood calcium levels begin to fall, the parathyroid glands release more parathyroid hormone (PTH) into the blood. PTH, along with calcitriol (vitamin D hormone), causes the: bones to release more calcium into the blood intestines to absorb more calcium from food kidneys to reduce the amount of calcium passed out of the body in urine (and to pass out more phosphate) If blood calcium rises too much, less PTH is released from the parathyroid glands and calcium levels start to fall again. In hypo- and hyperparathyroidism, this system doesn't work properly.

People with albinism have a reduced amount of melanin or no melanin at all, which can cause characteristic signs and symptoms often obvious from birth. Depending on the amount of melanin the person has, they may have very pale hair, skin and eyes, although some people with albinism can have brown or ginger hair and skin that can tan. People with albinism also usually have a number of eye conditions, such as: problems with eyesight \u2013 they may benefit from wearing glasses, although these can't usually fully correct vision nystagmus (involuntary eye movements) photophobia (sensitivity to light) Read more about the symptoms of albinism and diagnosing albinism. What causes albinism? In albinism, cells that produce melanin do not work properly because of inherited genetic mutations (faulty genes). There are a number of faulty genes that can cause albinism, and these are passed onto a child by their parents. Read more about the causes of albinism. Who is affected It is estimated that about one in every 17,000 people has some form of albinism. The condition generally affects both sexes equally, although there is one type \u2013 known as ocular albinism (which mainly affects the eyes) \u2013 that is more common in males. Albinism can affect people of all ethnic groups. Treatment for people with albinism Albinism itself does not need treatment, but the associated skin and eye problems it can cause often do. A child with albinism will need regular eye tests and it is likely they will need to wear glasses or contact lenses to correct vision problems such as short-sightedness, long-sightedness or astigmatism. Those with albinism will also need to take extra care in the sun. Without melanin, ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight can easily damage their skin (sunburn) and increase their risk of developing skin cancer. Read more about treating albinism. Outlook Albinism is a lifelong condition, but it doesn't get worse over time. A person with albinism\u2019s vision is unlikely to ever reach normal levels, even with glasses or contact lenses, and a child with the condition will often need extra support at school. A child with albinism may also need support to help them deal with any bullying they may experience because they look different. However, there is usually no reason why a person with albinism cannot otherwise do well in normal schooling, further education and employment. Information about you If you have albinism, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Naturally low blood pressure is unlikely to cause any symptoms and is normally nothing to worry about. But if your blood pressure drops too low, it can restrict the amount of blood flowing to your brain and other vital organs, which can cause unsteadiness, dizziness or fainting. See your GP if you experience any symptoms of low blood pressure and are concerned. All adults should have their blood pressure checked at least every five years. If you haven't had yours measured or don't know what your reading is, ask your GP to check it. Read more about the symptoms of low blood pressure. What is low blood pressure? The heart pumps a constant supply of blood around the body through arteries, veins and capillaries. Blood pressure is a measure of the force of the blood on the walls of the arteries as the blood flows through them. It's measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) and recorded as two measurements: systolic pressure \u2013 the pressure when your heart beats and squeezes blood into your arteries diastolic pressure \u2013 the pressure when your heart rests between beats  For example, if your systolic blood pressure is 120mmHg and your diastolic blood pressure is 80mmHg, your blood pressure is 120 over 80, which is commonly written as 120\/80. Normal blood pressure is between 90\/60 and 140\/90. If you have a reading of 140\/90 or more, you have high blood pressure (hypertension). This puts you at greater risk of developing serious health conditions, such as heart attack or stroke. People with a blood pressure reading under 90\/60 are usually regarded as having low blood pressure. Read more about diagnosing low blood pressure. Why do I have low blood pressure? You can have low blood pressure for many reasons, including the time of day, your age, the temperature, any medication you may be on, an injury, and some illnesses. Read more about the causes of low blood pressure. Treatment and self-help Naturally low blood pressure doesn't usually need to be treated unless it's causing symptoms such as dizziness or recurrent falls. If it's causing symptoms, your GP will look at what the cause might be in case it can be treated. There are also various things you can do to help limit symptoms of low blood pressure, including: standing up gradually and avoiding standing for long periods of time ensuring you are well hydrated wearing support stockings adding more salt to your diet eating smaller meals more often Read more about treating low blood pressure.

Normal body temperature is around 37C (98.6F). Hypothermia can quickly become life threatening and should be treated as a medical emergency. It's usually caused by being in a cold environment and can be triggered by a combination of factors, such as being outdoors in cold conditions for a long time, living in a poorly heated house or falling into cold water. Who's at risk? People who are unable to move around to generate heat, such as the elderly or those who are ill, are at particular risk of developing hypothermia. During 2013-14, more than 1,600 people seen in hospital were diagnosed with hypothermia. Just over 70% of these cases were people over 60 years of age. Babies are also more prone to developing hypothermia because their bodies' ability to regulate temperature isn't fully developed. But it's not just babies and elderly or ill people who develop hypothermia. Anyone who spends long periods outside during the winter without wearing appropriate warm clothing can also be at risk, particularly after drinking large amounts of alcohol. For example, in recent years there have been several cases of young people developing hypothermia after getting drunk on a night out and failing to find their way home, wearing only light clothes. People who spend a considerable amount of time outside in cold weather conditions, such as climbers and skiers, are also at increased risk of getting hypothermia, particularly if they don't wear suitable clothing. Read more about the causes of hypothermia. Signs of hypothermia The signs of hypothermia vary depending on how low a person's temperature has dropped. Initial symptoms include shivering, tiredness, fast breathing and cold or pale skin. As the temperature drops, shivering becomes more violent, although it will stop completely if the hypothermia gets worse. The person is likely to become delirious and struggle to breathe or move. They may lose consciousness. Babies with hypothermia may look healthy, but their skin will feel cold. They may also be limp, unusually quiet and refuse to feed. Read more about the symptoms of hypothermia. When to get medical help You should seek immediate medical help if you suspect someone has hypothermia. If someone you know has been exposed to the cold and they're distressed, confused, have slow, shallow breathing or they're unconscious, they may have severe hypothermia. In this case, dial 999 immediately to request an ambulance. Helping someone with hypothermia While waiting for medical help, it's important to try to prevent further heat loss and gently warm the person. Follow these steps: move the person indoors or somewhere warm as soon as possible once they're somewhere warm, carefully remove any wet clothing and dry them wrap them in blankets, towels or coats If the person is unconscious, not breathing and you can't detect a pulse in their neck after 60 seconds, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be given if you know how to do it. Once CPR is started, it should be continued without any breaks until medical assistance arrives. After the person is transferred to hospital, advanced medical treatments, such as removing blood from the body, heating it and returning it to the body, can be used to warm the person up. Read more about treating hypothermia. Preventing hypothermia There are several things you can do to prevent hypothermia. Simple measures can help, such as wearing appropriate warm clothing in cold weather and ensuring that children are well wrapped up when they go outside. Whenever possible, keep an eye on elderly or ill neighbours and relatives to ensure that their home is warm during cold weather.

Common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness, weight gain and feeling depressed. An underactive thyroid can often be successfully treated by taking daily hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn't making. There's no way of preventing an underactive thyroid. Most cases are caused either by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it, or by damage to the thyroid that occurs during some treatments for an overactive thyroid or thyroid cancer. Read more about the causes of an underactive thyroid. When to see your GP Symptoms of an underactive thyroid are often similar to those of other conditions, and they usually develop slowly, so you may not notice them for years. You should see your GP and ask to be tested for an underactive thyroid if you have symptoms including: tiredness weight gain depression  being sensitive to the cold dry skin and hair muscle aches The only accurate way of finding out whether you have a thyroid problem is to have a thyroid function test, where a sample of blood is tested to measure your hormone levels. Read more about testing for an underactive thyroid. Who's affected Both men and women can have an underactive thyroid, although it's more common in women. In the UK, it affects 15 in every 1,000 women and 1 in 1,000 men. Children can also develop an underactive thyroid. Around 1 in 3,500-4,000 babies are born with an underactive thyroid (congenital hypothyroidism). All babies born in the UK are screened for congenital hypothyroidism using a blood spot test when the baby is about five days old. Treating an underactive thyroid Treatment for an underactive thyroid involves taking daily hormone replacement tablets, called levothyroxine, to raise your thyroxine levels. You'll usually need treatment for the rest of your life. However, with proper treatment, you should be able to lead a normal, healthy life. If an underactive thyroid isn't treated, it can lead to complications, including heart disease, goitre, pregnancy problems and a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma (although this is very rare). Read more about treating an underactive thyroid and the complications of an underactive thyroid. The thyroid gland The thyroid gland is a small butterfly-shaped gland in the neck, just in front of the windpipe (trachea). One of its main functions is to produce hormones that help regulate the body's metabolism (the process that turns food into energy). These hormones are called triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). Many of the body's functions slow down when the thyroid doesn't produce enough of these hormones.

Healthy muscles are never fully relaxed. They retain a certain amount of tension and stiffness (muscle tone) that can be felt as resistance to movement. For example, a person relies on the tone in their back and neck muscles to maintain their position when standing or sitting up. Muscle tone decreases during sleep, so if you fall asleep sitting up, you may wake up with your head flopped forward. Hypotonia isn't the same as muscle weakness, although it can be difficult to use the affected muscles. In some conditions, muscle weakness sometimes develops in association with hypotonia. It is most commonly detected in babies soon after birth or at a very young age, although it can also develop later in life. Signs of hypotonia Hypotonia present at birth is often noticeable by the time a child is six months old, if not before. Newborn babies and young children with severe hypotonia are often described as being \"floppy\". Signs of hypotonia in a child include: having little or no control of their neck muscles, so their head tends to flop feeling limp when held, as though they could easily slip through your hands being unable to place any weight on their leg or shoulder muscles their arms and legs hang straight down from their sides, rather than bending at their elbows, hips and knees finding sucking and swallowing difficult a weak cry or quiet voice in infants and young children  A child with hypotonia often takes longer to reach motor developmental milestones, such as sitting up, crawling, walking, talking and feeding themselves. An adult with hypotonia may have the following problems: clumsiness and falling frequently difficulty getting up from a lying or sitting position an unusually high degree of flexibility in the hips, elbows and knees difficulty reaching for or lifting objects (in cases where there's also muscle weakness) What causes hypotonia? Hypotonia is a symptom rather than a condition. It can be caused by a number of different underlying health problems, many of which are inherited. Hypotonia can also sometimes occur in cerebral palsy, where a number of neurological (brain-related) problems affect a child's movement and co-ordination, and after serious infections, such as meningitis. In some cases, babies born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) have hypotonia because their muscle tone isn't fully developed by the time they're born. However, provided there are no other underlying problems, this should gradually improve as the baby develops and gets older. Read more about the causes of hypotonia. Diagnosing hypotonia If your child is identified as having hypotonia, they should be referred to a specialist healthcare professional, who will try to identify the cause. The specialist will ask about your family history, pregnancy and delivery, and whether any problems have occurred since birth. A number of tests may also be recommended, including blood tests, a computerised tomography (CT) scan, or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Read more about how hypotonia is diagnosed. Treating hypotonia Depending on the cause, hypotonia can improve, stay the same or get worse over time. Babies with hypotonia that results from being born prematurely will usually improve as they get older. Babies with hypotonia caused by an infection or another condition will usually improve if the underlying condition is treated successfully. Unfortunately, it's often not possible to cure the underlying cause of hypotonia. Hypotonia that has been inherited will persist throughout a person's life, although the child's motor development may steadily improve over time in cases that are non-progressive (don't get worse). Treatment can also help improve functions such as mobility and speech. In these cases, treatment may involve physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy.

You'll no longer be able to get pregnant after the operation. If you haven't already gone through the menopause, you'll no longer have periods, regardless of your age. The menopause is when a woman's monthly periods stop, which usually occurs from the ages of to 45 to 55. Around 30,500 hysterectomies were carried out in England in 2012 and 2013. It's more common for women aged 40-50 to have a hysterectomy. Why do I need a hysterectomy? Hysterectomies are carried out to treat conditions that affect the female reproductive system, including: heavy periods long-term pelvic pain non-cancerous tumours (fibroids) ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer or cancer of the fallopian tubes A hysterectomy is a major operation with a long recovery time and is only considered after alternative, less invasive, treatments have been tried. Read more about why a hysterectomy is needed. Things to consider If you have a hysterectomy, as well as having your womb removed, you may have to decide whether to also have your cervix or ovaries removed. Your decision will usually be based on your personal feelings, medical history and any recommendations your doctor may have. You should research the different types of hysterectomy and their implications. Read about the things to consider before having a hysterectomy. Types of hysterectomy There are various types of hysterectomy. The type you have depends on why you need the operation and how much of your womb and surrounding reproductive system can safely be left in place. The main types of hysterectomy are: total hysterectomy \u2013 the womb and cervix (neck of the womb) are removed; this is the most commonly performed operation subtotal hysterectomy \u2013 the main body of the womb is removed, leaving the cervix in place total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy \u2013 the womb, cervix, fallopian tubes (salpingectomy) and the ovaries (oophorectomy) are removed radical hysterectomy \u2013 the womb and surrounding tissues are removed, including the fallopian tubes, part of the vagina, ovaries, lymph glands and fatty tissue There are three ways to carry out a hysterectomy: vaginal hysterectomy \u2013 where the womb is removed through a cut in the top of the vagina abdominal hysterectomy \u2013 where the womb is removed through a cut in the lower abdomen laparoscopic hysterectomy (keyhole surgery) \u2013 where the womb is removed through several small cuts in the abdomen Read more about how a hysterectomy is performed. Complications of a hysterectomy There's a small risk of complications, including: heavy bleeding infection damage to your bladder or bowel serious reaction to the general anaesthetic Read more about the complications of a hysterectomy. Recovering from a hysterectomy A hysterectomy is a major operation. You can be in hospital for up to five days after surgery, and it takes about six to eight weeks to fully recover. Recovery times can also vary, depending on the type of hysterectomy. Rest as much as possible during this time and don't lift anything heavy, such as bags of shopping. You need time for your abdominal muscles and tissues to heal. Read more about recovering from a hysterectomy. Surgical menopause If your ovaries are removed during a hysterectomy, you'll go through the menopause immediately after the operation, regardless of your age. This is known as a surgical menopause. If one or both of your ovaries are left intact, there's a chance you'll experience the menopause within five years of having your operation. If you experience a surgical menopause after having a hysterectomy, you should be offered hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Read more about surgical menopause. The female reproductive system The female reproductive system is made up of the: womb (uterus) \u2013 a pear-shaped organ in the middle of your pelvis where a baby develops; the lining of the womb is shed during a period cervix \u2013 the neck of the womb, where the womb meets the vagina; the cervix is the lower part of the womb and not separate vagina \u2013 a muscular tube below the cervix fallopian tubes \u2013 tubes that connect the womb to the ovaries ovaries \u2013 small organs by the fallopian tubes that release an egg each month Page last reviewed: 22\/03\/2016 Next review due: 22\/03\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's carried out using a hysteroscope, which is a narrow telescope with a light and camera at the end. Images are sent to a monitor so your doctor or specialist nurse can see inside your womb. The hysteroscope is passed into your womb through your vagina and cervix (entrance to the womb), which means no cuts need to be made in your skin. When a hysteroscopy may be carried out A hysteroscopy can be used to: investigate symptoms or problems \u2013 such as heavy periods, unusual vaginal bleeding, postmenopausal bleeding, pelvic pain, repeated miscarriages or difficulty getting pregnant diagnose conditions \u2013 such as fibroids and polyps (non-cancerous growths in the womb) treat conditions and problems \u2013 such as removing fibroids, polyps, displaced intrauterine devices (IUDs) and intrauterine adhesions (scar tissue that causes absent periods and reduced fertility) A procedure called dilatation and curettage (D&C) used to be commonly used to examine the womb and remove abnormal growths, but nowadays hysteroscopies are carried out instead. What happens during a hysteroscopy A hysteroscopy is usually carried out on an outpatient or day-case basis. This means you don't have to stay in hospital overnight. It may not be necessary to use anaesthetic for the procedure, although local anaesthetic (where medication is used to numb your cervix) is sometimes used. General anaesthetic may be used if you\u2019re having treatment during the procedure or you would prefer to be asleep while it\u2019s carried out. During a hysteroscopy: you lie on a couch with your legs held in supports and a sheet is used to cover your lower half an instrument called a speculum may be inserted into your vagina to hold it open (the same instrument used for a cervical screening test), although this isn't always necessary the hysteroscope is passed into your womb and fluid is gently pumped inside to make it easier for your doctor to see the camera sends pictures to a monitor so your doctor can spot and\/or treat any abnormalities A hysteroscopy can take up to 30 minutes in total, although it may only last around 5-10 minutes if it's just being done to diagnose a condition or investigate symptoms. You may experience some discomfort similar to period cramps while it's carried out, but it shouldn't be painful. Read more about what happens during a hysteroscopy.  Recovering from a hysteroscopy Most women feel able to return to their normal activities the following day, although some women return to work the same day. You may wish to have a few days off to rest if general anaesthetic was used. While you're recovering: you can eat and drink as normal straight away you may experience cramping that's similar to period pain and some spotting or bleeding for a few days \u2013 this is normal and nothing to worry about unless it's heavy you should avoid having sex for a week, or until any bleeding has stopped, to reduce the risk of infection (see below) Your doctor or nurse will discuss the findings of the procedure with you before you leave hospital. Read more about what happens after a hysteroscopy. Risks of a hysteroscopy A hysteroscopy is generally very safe, but like any procedure there is a small risk of complications. The risk is higher for women who have treatment during a hysteroscopy.  Some of the main risks associated with a hysteroscopy are: accidental damage to the womb \u2013 this is uncommon, but may require treatment with antibiotics in hospital or, in rare cases, another operation to repair it accidental damage to the cervix \u2013 this is rare and can usually be easily repaired excessive bleeding during or after surgery \u2013 this can occur if you had treatment under general anaesthetic and can be treated with medication or another procedure; very rarely it may be necessary to remove the womb (hysterectomy) infection of the womb \u2013 this can cause smelly vaginal discharge, a fever and heavy bleeding; it can usually be treated with a short course of antibiotics from your GP feeling faint \u2013 this affects 1 in every 200 women who have a hysteroscopy carried out without an anaesthetic or just a local anaesthetic A hysteroscopy will only be carried out if the benefits are thought to outweigh the risks. Alternatives to hysteroscopy Your womb could also be examined by using a: pelvic ultrasound \u2013 where a small probe is inserted in the vagina and uses sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your womb endometrial biopsy \u2013 when a narrow tube is passed through your cervix into your womb, with suction used to remove a sample of your womb's lining These alternatives may be performed alongside a hysteroscopy, but do not provide as much information and can't be used to treat problems in the same way as a hysteroscopy.
