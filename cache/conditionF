It occurs when a parent or carer, usually the child\u2019s biological mother, exaggerates or deliberately causes symptoms of illness in the child. FII is also known as Munchausen's syndrome by proxy. Munchausen's syndrome, also known as factitious disorder, is a condition where a person pretends to be ill or causes illness or injury to themselves. However, healthcare professionals in the UK prefer to use the term fabricated or induced illness, or factitious disorder imposed on another. This is because the term Munchausen's syndrome by proxy places the emphasis on the person carrying out the abuse, rather than the victim. The term Munchausen's syndrome by proxy is still widely used in other countries. Behaviours in FII The term FII covers a wide range of cases and behaviours involving parents seeking healthcare for a child. This ranges from extreme neglect (failing to seek medical care) to induced illness. Behaviours in FII include: a mother or other carer who convinces their child they are ill when they are perfectly healthy a mother or other carer who exaggerates or lies about their child\u2019s symptoms a mother or other carer who manipulates test results to suggest the presence of illness \u2013 for example, by putting glucose in urine samples to suggest the child has diabetes a mother or other carer who deliberately induces symptoms of illness \u2013 for example, by poisoning her child with unnecessary medication or other substances Learn more about the signs of fabricated or induced illness. How common is fabricated or induced illness? It's difficult to estimate how widespread FII is, because many cases may go unreported or undetected. In an average population of one million people, around one child per year would be affected. The British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU), which is a specialist unit that assists research into rare childhood conditions, carried out a study of FII cases. It identified 97 cases of FII in the UK over a two-year period. However, it's likely that this figure underestimates the true prevalence of FII. FII can involve children of all ages, but the most severe cases usually involve children under five. In over 90% of reported cases of FII, the child\u2019s mother is responsible for the abuse. However, cases have been reported in which the father, foster parent, grandparent, guardian, or a healthcare or childcare professional was responsible. Motivation It's not fully understood why FII occurs. In cases where the mother is responsible, it could be that the mother enjoys the attention of playing the role of a \"caring mother\". A large number of mothers involved in cases of FII had a previous history of unresolved psychological and behavioural problems, such as a history of self-harming, or drug or alcohol misuse, or have experienced the death of another child. A high proportion of mothers involved in FII have been found to have so-called \"somatoform disorders\", where they experience multiple, recurrent physical symptoms. A proportion of these mothers also have Munchausen's syndrome. A high proportion of mothers also have a type of mental health problem called borderline personality disorder, which is characterised by emotional instability, impulsiveness and disturbed thinking. There have been several reported cases where illness was fabricated or induced for financial reasons \u2013 for example, to claim disability benefits. Read more about the possible causes of fabricated or induced illness. Child protection FII is a child protection issue and cannot be treated by the NHS alone. Medical professionals who suspect FII is taking place should liaise with social services and the police, and must follow local child protection procedures. If your job involves working with children \u2013 for example, if you are a nursery worker or teacher, you should inform the person in your organisation who is responsible for child protection issues. If you don't know who this is, your immediate supervisor or manager should be able to tell you. If you suspect that someone you know may be fabricating or inducing illness in their child, it's not recommended that you confront them directly. A direct confrontation is unlikely to make a person admit to wrongdoing, and it may give them the opportunity to dispose of any evidence of abuse. You can contact your local social services department or telephone the NSPCC\u2019s child protection helpline, which is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, on 0808 800 5000. Read more about diagnosing fabricated or induced illness. Treatment The child The first priority is to protect the child and restore them to good health. This may involve removing the child from the care of the person responsible. If the child is in hospital, it may involve removing the responsible parent or carer from the ward. They may need help returning to a normal lifestyle, including going back to school. Younger children and babies who don't understand they were victims of abuse often make a good recovery once the abuse stops. Older children, particularly those who have been abused for many years, will have more complex problems. For example, many older affected children believe they are really ill. They need help and support to develop a more realistic understanding of their health. They may also need to learn how to tell the difference between the lies of their parent or carer and reality. It's also common for older children to feel loyal to their parent or carer, and a sense of guilt if that parent or carer is removed from the family. The parent or carer Once the child is safe, it may be possible to treat the parent or carer's underlying psychological problems. This may include a combination of: intensive psychotherapy family therapy \u2013 the father may need individual help, especially if he is the main caregiver The aim of psychotherapy is to uncover and resolve the issues that caused them to fake or induce illness in their child. The aim of family therapy is to resolve any tensions within the family, improve parenting skills and attempt to repair the relationship between the parent or carer and the child. In more severe cases, the parent or carer may be compulsorily detained in a psychiatric ward under the Mental Health Act so their relationship with their child can be closely monitored. Parents or carers involved in FII are difficult to treat, because most do not admit their deceptions and refuse to admit their abusive behaviour. Therefore, in many cases, the child is permanently removed from their care. The best results occur in cases where the parent or carer: understands and acknowledges the harm they have caused is able to communicate the underlying motivations and needs that led them to fake or cause illness is able to work together with healthcare and other professionals Outlook Children affected by FII can experience long-term consequences in terms of their physical health, as well as significant psychological and emotional trauma. A BPSU study found that one in four victims of FII still had significant physical and\/or psychological problems two years after the abuse had stopped. In cases involving administering unnecessary medicines or other substances, it's estimated that around 1 in 16 will die as a result of this abuse. A further 1 in 14 will experience long-term or permanent injury. Munchausen\u2019s syndrome Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video. A psychiatrist explains the motivation behind Munchausen\u2019s syndrome, also known as factitious illness, where someone pretends to be ill or causes symptoms in themselves. This can include inflicting wounds or tampering with blood and urine samples. He also explains the importance of getting treatment and describes another form of the condition where a person fabricates an illness in someone in their care. Media last reviewed: 20\/05\/2016 Next review due: 20\/05\/2018 Media controversy There has been some controversy in the media regarding FII, with some commentators suggesting that it's not a real phenomenon. However, there's a great deal of evidence to suggest the condition does exist. The evidence of abuse includes hundreds of case files from more than 20 different countries, the confessions of mothers and other carers, the testimony of children and secret video footage.

Face blindness often affects people from birth and is usually a problem a person has for most or all of their life. It can have a severe impact on everyday life (see below). Many people with prosopagnosia aren't able to recognise family members, partners or friends. They may cope by using alternative strategies to recognise people, such as remembering the way they walk, or their hairstyle, voice or clothing. But these types of compensation strategies don't always work, particularly when a person with prosopagnosia meets someone out of context, at a place or time they're not used to seeing that person. The impact of prosopagnosia A person with prosopagnosia may avoid social interaction and develop social anxiety disorder (an overwhelming fear of social situations). They may also have difficulty forming relationships or experience problems with their career. Episodes of depression aren't uncommon. Some people with prosopagnosia are unable to recognise certain facial expressions, judge a person's age or gender, or follow a person's gaze. Others may not even recognise their own face in the mirror or in photos. Prosopagnosia can affect a person's ability to recognise objects, such as places or cars. Many people also have difficulty navigating. This can involve an inability to process angles or distance, or problems remembering places and landmarks.  Following the plot of films or television programmes can be almost impossible for someone with prosopagnosia because characters aren't recognisable. Someone with prosopagnosia may worry that they appear rude or disinterested when they fail to recognise a person.  What causes prosopagnosia? There are two types of prosopagnosia known as: developmental prosopagnosia \u2013 where a person has prosopagnosia without having brain damage acquired prosopagnosia \u2013 where a person develops prosopagnosia after sustaining damage to their brain, often following a stroke or a head injury In the past, most cases of prosopagnosia were thought to occur following a brain injury (acquired prosopagnosia). But research has found that many more people have prosopagnosia without having brain damage (developmental prosopagnosia) than was first thought. Developmental prosopagnosia A number of studies have indicated that as many as one in 50 people may have developmental prosopagnosia, which equates to about 1.5 million people in the UK. Most people with developmental prosopagnosia simply fail to develop the ability to recognise faces. Someone born with the condition may not realise they have a problem. Developmental prosopagnosia may have a genetic component and run in families. Many people with the condition have reported at least one first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling (brother or sister) who also has problems recognising faces. Acquired prosopagnosia Acquired prosopagnosia is rare. When someone acquires prosopagnosia after a brain injury, they'll quickly notice that they've lost the ability to recognise people they know. But if prosopagnosia occurs after brain damage in early childhood, before the child has fully developed the ability to recognise faces, they may grow up not realising they're unable to recognise faces as well as other people can. Prosopagnosia isn't related to memory problems, vision loss or learning disabilities, but it's sometimes associated with other developmental disorders, such as autistic spectrum disorder, Turner syndrome and Williams syndrome. Diagnosing prosopagnosia If you have problems recognising faces, your GP may refer you to a clinical neuropsychologist working within the NHS or private practice. You may also be referred to a researcher who specialises in the field and is based at a nearby university. You'll have an assessment involving a range of tests that assess your face recognition ability, among other skills. For example, you may be asked to: memorise and later recognise faces you've never seen before recognise famous faces spot similarities and differences between faces presented next to each other judge age, gender or emotional expression from a set of faces If you live within travelling distance of Bournemouth University, the Centre for Face Processing Disorders may be able to offer you a formal testing session and the opportunity to take part in their research programme. Treating prosopagnosia There's no specific treatment for prosopagnosia, but researchers are continuing to investigate what causes the condition, and training programmes are being developed to help improve facial recognition. It's thought that compensatory strategies that help with person recognition, or techniques that attempt to restore normal face-processing mechanisms, may work for some people with either developmental or acquired prosopagnosia. A person's age when their brain was damaged (in the case of acquired prosopagnosia), the type and severity of the brain injury, and the timing of treatment, are all thought to be important factors in relation to how effective a rehabilitation programme will be. Many people with prosopagnosia develop compensatory strategies to help them recognise people, such as recognising a person's voice, clothing or gait (the way they walk). However, compensatory strategies based on contextual cues don't always work, and may break down when a person with prosopagnosia meets someone they know in an unexpected location or who's changed their appearance. Headway has produced a factsheet called Prosopagnosia \u2013 face blindness after brain injury (PDF, 404kb). It has some useful information about living with the condition, including social, observational, memory and navigation strategies, plus tips for watching TV and films. Does my child have prosopagnosia? It can be difficult to recognise prosopagnosia in children, but the following are potential signs: your child frequently fails to recognise familiar people when encountering them unexpectedly they're particularly clingy in public places they wait for you to wave when you're collecting them from school, or approach strangers thinking they're you they're socially withdrawn at school and have difficulty making friends (this may be in contrast to more confident behaviour at home, when recognition isn't an issue) they find it difficult to follow plots of films or TV shows The Centre for Face Processing Disorders, based at Bournemouth University, has more information about prosopagnosia in children.

The procedure is designed to reduce flabby or sagging skin around the lower half of the face (mainly the jowls) and neck. If you're thinking of going ahead, be absolutely sure about your reasons for wanting a facelift and don't rush into it. The procedure can be expensive, the results can't be guaranteed, and there are risks to consider. It's a good idea to discuss your plans with your GP first. You can also read Is cosmetic surgery right for me?. Read on to find out: How much does it cost?  Where do I go?  What does it involve?  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems  More information  How much does it cost? In the UK, the cost of a facelift can vary greatly from clinic to clinic and depending on the extent of the procedure.  Expect to pay anything from a few thousand pounds for a mini facelift to £10,000 for a face and neck lift. You should also take into account the cost of any consultations or follow-up care that may be needed. Where do I go? If you're looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform facelifts.  All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC. The CQC publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. Also, research the surgeon who is going to carry out the facelift. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor's fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many facelifts they've performed where there have been complications what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? A facelift is usually carried out under general anaesthetic. It may sometimes be performed using a local anaesthetic and sedation. There are many different kinds of facelift, but generally the surgeon will: make cuts (incisions) above the hairline at the temples, which extend down in front of your ear, underneath your earlobe and behind the ear make cuts under the chin if the jawline is also being lifted remove the surplus facial skin pull the remaining skin backwards and upwards before stitching it into its new position sometimes redistribute facial fat and tissue or add this to the face bandage the face to minimise bruising and swelling It usually takes two to three hours, and most people need to stay in hospital overnight. Pain relief is provided if you experience any discomfort afterwards. Recovery It takes about two to four weeks to fully recover from a facelift. You need to take this time off work. Bruising is visible for at least two weeks. It could take up to six to nine months to see the full effect of the facelift. You won't be able to drive for a number of days after the operation \u2013 your surgeon would advise about this. You will have to avoid showering and getting the bandages wet for the first two days, and avoid strenuous activity, saunas and massages for at least two weeks. You also need to keep your head propped up with pillows for a couple of days while resting to reduce the swelling. After about a week: Stitches are removed (unless you had dissolvable stitches). After several weeks: Bruises, scars and redness should have faded. After six to nine months: The full effect of the facelift should be seen. Side effects to expect After a facelift, it's common to have: a stiff, puffy and numb face for a few weeks or months temporary bruising of the cheeks \u2013 the bruises will eventually move down the neck with gravity scars \u2013 these fade, but won't completely disappear a raised hairline or sideburn What could go wrong A facelift can occasionally result in problems, including: a collection of blood underneath the skin (haematoma) nerve injury and loss of sensation or movement in the face asymmetrical facial features \u2013 including the position of the earlobe  hair loss or a small but permanent reduction in hair growth around the scars thick, obvious scars developing Any type of operation also carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding developing a blood clot in a vein infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, patients find the desired effect wasn't achieved and feel they need another operation. You should check how this would be funded with your surgeon. What to do if you have problems  Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms. If you are not happy with the results of your facelift, or you think the procedure wasn't carried out properly, you should take up the matter with your surgeon through the hospital or clinic where you were treated. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC).

It is the most common cause of facial paralysis. Other causes of facial paralysis include: congenital facial palsy \u2013 children born with facial weakness injury to the facial nerve in an accident \u2013 such as a cut to the cheek or skull base fracture injury from surgery \u2013 which is most common during surgery of the parotid gland and neck What are the symptoms? The symptoms of Bell\u2019s palsy vary from person to person. The weakness on one side of the face can be described as either: partial palsy, which is mild muscle weakness complete palsy, which is no movement at all (paralysis) \u2013 although this is very rare Bell's palsy can also affect the eyelid and mouth, making it difficult to close and open them. In rare cases, it can affect both sides of a person\u2019s face. Read more about the symptoms of Bell's palsy When to seek medical advice As well as being a symptom of Bell's palsy, facial weakness or paralysis can also be a sign of a more serious condition \u2013 such as a stroke. Visit your nearest A&E department immediately or call 999 for an ambulance if you or someone you are with develops sudden facial paralysis, so a doctor can determine the cause. Bell's palsy is only diagnosed if other possible causes of your symptoms are ruled out. Read more about diagnosing Bell's palsy. Why does it happen? Bell's palsy is believed to occur when the nerve that controls the muscles in your face becomes compressed. The exact cause is unknown, although it's thought to be because the facial nerve becomes inflamed, possibly due to a viral infection.  The herpes virus is thought to be the most common cause but other viruses may also be responsible. Read more about the causes of Bell's palsy Who is affected? Bell's palsy is a rare condition that affects about one in 5,000 people a year. It's most common in people aged 15-60, but people outside this age group can also suffer from the condition. Both men and women are affected equally. Bell's palsy is more common in pregnant women and those with diabetes and HIV, for reasons that are not yet fully understood. Treating Bell's palsy Around seven out of 10 people with Bell's palsy make a complete recovery, with or without treatment. Most people notice an improvement in their symptoms after about two to three weeks but a complete recovery can take up to nine months. The recovery time varies from person to person and will depend on the amount of nerve damage. Prednisolone, a type of corticosteroid, is used to reduce the swelling of the facial nerve. Eye drops may be required to prevent problems if you are unable to close your eye. Tape may also be used to close the eye while sleeping. Read more about treatments for Bell's palsy. Complications Around three in 10 people with Bell\u2019s palsy will continue to experience weakness in their facial muscles, and two in 10 will be left with a more serious long-term problem. Complications include: persistent facial weakness eye problems difficulty with speech, eating and drinking reduced sense of taste facial muscle twitching Bell's palsy may reoccur in up to 14% of people, especially if there is a family history of the condition.

Their main intention is to assume the \"sick role\" to have people care for them and be the centre of attention. Any practical benefit in pretending to be sick \u2013 for example, claiming incapacity benefit \u2013 isn't the reason for their behaviour. Munchausen's syndrome is named after a German aristocrat, Baron Munchausen, who became famous for telling wild, unbelievable tales about his exploits. Types of behaviour People with Munchausen's syndrome can behave in a number of different ways, including: pretending to have psychological symptoms \u2013 for example, claiming to hear voices or claiming to see things that aren't really there pretending to have physical symptoms \u2013 for example, claiming to have chest pain or a stomach ache actively trying to get ill \u2013 such as deliberately infecting a wound by rubbing dirt into it Some people with Munchausen's syndrome may spend years travelling from hospital to hospital feigning a wide range of illnesses. When it's discovered they're lying, they may suddenly leave hospital and move to another area. People with Munchausen's syndrome can be very manipulative and, in the most serious cases, may undergo painful and sometimes life-threatening surgery, even though they know it's unnecessary. Read more about the signs and symptoms of Munchausen's syndrome. What causes Munchausen's syndrome? Munchausen's syndrome is complex and poorly understood. Many people refuse psychiatric treatment or psychological profiling, and it's unclear why people with the syndrome behave in the way they do. Based on the available research and case studies, several factors have been identified as possible causes of Munchausen's syndrome. These include: emotional trauma or illness during childhood \u2013 this often resulted in extensive medical attention a personality disorder \u2013 a mental health condition that causes patterns of abnormal thinking and behaviour a grudge against authority figures or healthcare professionals Childhood trauma Munchausen's syndrome may be caused by parental neglect and abandonment, or other childhood trauma. As a result of this trauma, a person may have unresolved issues with their parents that cause them to fake illness. They may do this because they: have a compulsion to punish themselves (masochism) by making themselves ill because they feel unworthy need to feel important and be the centre of attention need to pass responsibility for their wellbeing and care on to other people There's also some evidence to suggest people who've had extensive medical procedures, or received prolonged medical attention during childhood or adolescence, are more likely to develop Munchausen's syndrome when they're older. This may be because they associate their childhood memories with a sense of being cared for. As they get older, they try to obtain the same feelings of reassurance by pretending to be ill. Personality disorders Some examples of the different personality disorders thought to be linked with Munchausen's syndrome include: antisocial personality disorder \u2013 a person may take pleasure in manipulating and deceiving doctors, giving them a sense of power and control borderline personality disorder \u2013 where a person struggles to control their feelings and often swings between positive and negative views of others narcissistic personality disorder \u2013 where a person often swings between seeing themselves as special and fearing they're worthless It could be that the person has an unstable sense of their own identity and also has difficulties establishing meaningful relationships with others. Playing the \"sick role\" allows them to adopt an identity that brings unconditional support and acceptance from others with it. Admission to hospital also gives the person a clearly defined place in a social network. Diagnosing Munchausen's syndrome Diagnosing Munchausen's syndrome can be challenging for medical professionals. People with the syndrome are often very convincing and skilled at manipulating and exploiting a doctor's concern for their patients, and their natural interest in investigating unusual medical conditions. Investigating claims If a healthcare professional suspects a person may have Munchausen's syndrome, they'll look at the person's health records to check for inconsistencies between their claimed and actual medical history. They may also contact the person's family and friends to find out whether their claims about their past are true. Healthcare professionals can also run tests to check for evidence of self-inflicted illness or tampering with clinical tests. For example, the person's blood can be checked for traces of medication they shouldn't be taking but which could explain their symptoms. Doctors will also want to rule out other possible motivations for their behaviour, such as faking illness for financial gain or because they want access to strong painkillers. Munchausen's syndrome can usually be confidently diagnosed if: there's clear evidence of fabricating or inducing symptoms the person's prime motivation is to be seen as sick there's no other likely reason or explanation for their behaviour Treating Munchausen's syndrome Treating Munchausen's syndrome can be difficult because most people refuse to admit they have a problem and won't co-operate with suggested treatment plans. Some experts recommend that healthcare professionals should adopt a gentle non-confrontational approach, suggesting the person has complex health needs and may benefit from a referral to a psychiatrist. Others argue that a person with Munchausen's syndrome should be confronted directly and asked why they've lied and whether they have stress and anxiety. One of the biggest ironies about Munchausen's syndrome is that people who have it are genuinely mentally ill, but will often only admit to having a physical illness. If a person admits to their behaviour, they can be referred to specialist psychiatric services for further treatment. If they don't admit to lying, most experts agree the doctor in charge of their care should minimise medical contact with them. This is because the doctor-patient relationship is based on trust and if there's evidence the patient can no longer be trusted, the doctor is unable to continue treating them. Psychiatric treatment and CBT It may be possible to help control the symptoms of Munchausen's syndrome if the person admits they have a problem and co-operates with treatment. There's no standard treatment for Munchausen's syndrome, but a combination of psychoanalysis and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has shown some success in helping people control their symptoms. Psychoanalysis is a type of psychotherapy which attempts to uncover and resolve these unconscious beliefs and motivations which can cause many psychological conditions. CBT helps a person identify unhelpful and unrealistic beliefs and behavioural patterns. A specially trained therapist teaches the person ways of replacing unrealistic beliefs with more realistic and balanced ones. Family therapy People with Munchausen's syndrome still in close contact with their family may also benefit from having family therapy. The person with the syndrome and their close family members discuss how it's affected the family and the positive changes that can be made. It can also teach family members how to avoid reinforcing the person's abnormal behaviour. For example, this could involve recognising when the person is playing the \"sick role\" and avoiding showing them concern or offering support. Who's affected? From the available case studies, there appear to be two relatively distinct groups of people affected by Munchausen's syndrome. They are: women who are 20 to 40 years of age, often with a background in healthcare, such as working as a nurse or medical technician unmarried white men who are 30 to 50 years of age  It's unclear why these two groups tend to be affected by Munchausen's syndrome. It's also not known how common the syndrome is. Some experts believe Munchausen's syndrome is underdiagnosed because many people succeed in deceiving medical staff. It's also possible cases may be overdiagnosed as the same person could use different identities. A large study carried out in a Canadian hospital estimated that out of 1,300 patients, there were 10 who were faking symptoms of illness. Fabricated or induced illness Fabricated or induced illness, also known as Munchausen's by proxy, is a variant of Munchausen's syndrome. This is where a person fabricates or induces illness in a person under their care. Most cases involve a mother and her child.

It's not a condition or a disorder itself, and is sometimes associated with blood clots (venous thromboses) that are caused by genetic changes (mutations). If you have thrombophilia, you're more likely to develop a blood clot in one of the large veins in your leg. This is known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  It's important to be aware of the signs of a DVT, such as unexplained pain, swelling or tenderness in your leg (usually in your calf). See your GP as soon as possible if you have these symptoms (see below). The blood clotting process When you cut yourself, the bleeding usually triggers a number of chemical reactions in the blood. The chemical reactions cause a blood clot to form, which sticks to the injured part of the blood vessel along with blood cells called platelets. Clotting substances, known as clotting factors, help control bleeding and work with platelets to ensure the blood clots effectively. However, in thrombophilia, there's an imbalance in clotting chemicals and a person with the disorder either has too much clotting factor, or too little of the substance that prevents clotting. Types of thrombophilia There are many different types of thrombophilia. Some of the main types are outlined below. Factor V Leiden Factor V Leiden is a type of thrombophilia caused by a specific gene mutation. It's the most common type of inherited thrombophilia, with 3-8% of Europeans having one copy of the factor V Leiden mutation in each cell, and about one in 5,000 people having two copies of the mutation. It's less common in other populations. If you have Factor V Leiden, your risk of developing a DVT is increased (see above). There's also a higher risk of blood clots breaking away from their original location and travelling to other areas of your body through your bloodstream. This can be particularly serious if the blood clot becomes stuck in the main artery of your lungs (the pulmonary artery). This is known as a pulmonary embolism and it can be life-threatening (see below). Prothrombin 20210 mutation Prothrombin 20210 mutation, also known as Factor II mutation, is another genetic blood disorder that increases the risk of clots. Prothrombin is a protein in the blood which helps it to clot (thicken). However, in some people, a mutation in the gene that produces prothrombin causes too much to be produced, resulting in an increased tendency for blood clots, such as DVTs, to form. As with Factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210 is more common in white people, particularly Europeans. Protein C, protein S or antithrombin deficiency Protein C, protein S, and antithrombin are natural anticoagulants (substances that prevent the blood from clotting). If you have low levels of these anticoagulants, or if they don't work properly, your risk of developing a DVT or pulmonary embolism is increased. Problems with protein C, protein S or antithrombin can be inherited but are rare. Antiphospholipid syndrome Antiphospholipid syndrome, also known as Hughes syndrome, is an immune system disorder that increases the risk of blood clots. Your body produces antibodies that attack phospholipids, a fat molecule thought to keep blood at the right consistency. The antibodies bind to the phospholipids, increasing your risk of a blood clot developing in a vein or artery. Symptoms of thrombophilia Thrombophilia is often mild and many people don't experience any health problems. Symptoms will only occur if the disorder causes a blood clot. People with thrombophilia are particularly at risk of developing a DVT.  Warning signs of a DVT include: pain, swelling and tenderness in one of your legs (usually your calf) a heavy ache in the affected area warm skin in the area of the clot redness of your skin, particularly at the back of your leg below the knee DVT usually, although not always, affects one leg. The pain may be worse when you bend your foot up towards your knee.  Part of the blood clot can sometimes break away and travel through the bloodstream. This is known as an embolism. Embolisms can be dangerous if they become lodged in the lungs (pulmonary embolism). This is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition because it can prevent blood from reaching your lungs. The symptoms of a pulmonary embolism are: chest or upper back pain shortness of breath coughing \u2013 usually dry but you may cough up blood or mucus containing blood feeling lightheaded or dizzy fainting See your GP immediately if you experience any combination of the above symptoms. Alternatively, you can call NHS 111 or contact your local out-of-hours service for advice. Dial 999 to request an ambulance if your symptoms are severe. Diagnosing thrombophilia Thrombophilia testing isn't routinely carried out on everyone who has a blood clot. Testing for inherited thrombophilia in people with venous thrombosis isn't usually needed because the results don't usually influence clinical decisions. For example, decisions regarding the length of treatment should be made by taking into consideration whether or not venous thrombosis was provoked, whether other risk factors are present, and the risk of bleeding due to treatment with anticoagulants, regardless of whether inherited thrombophilia is present or not. Thrombophilia is diagnosed by having blood tests weeks or months after your blood clot. The tests look for anticoagulant deficiencies. Before having the tests, you'll usually have to wait until you've stopped taking anticoagulant medicine, such as warfarin, for four to six weeks. If the blood test results indicate you have thrombophilia, you may be referred to a haematologist (a specialist in diagnosing and treating blood disorders). Treating thrombophilia Treatment may not be needed if you have mild thrombophilia. If you develop a blood clot, you'll need treatment for the blood clot and treatment to prevent further clots. You may need to take warfarin tablets or have an injection of heparin. Warfarin and heparin Warfarin and heparin are anticoagulants (anti-clotting medicine). They interfere with the clotting process and are commonly used to treat or prevent DVT and pulmonary embolisms. If you need an anticoagulant to prevent a clot, you'll be prescribed warfarin. It will take a few days to work properly. If you need instant treatment for an existing clot, you'll usually be given a heparin injection (which works straight away), as well as warfarin tablets for the first few days. The injection will either be given in hospital or at home. A heparin injection may also be given to people with antiphospholipid syndrome, before and after surgery or during pregnancy. Unlike warfarin, heparin is safe to take in pregnancy. International Normalised Ratio (INR) test Your doctor will need to adjust your warfarin dose so your blood doesn't clot easily, but isn't too high to put you at risk of bleeding problems. You'll need to have a regular blood test called the International Normalised Ratio (INR) to measure your blood clotting ability while taking warfarin. You'll have the INR test less frequently once your ideal dose has been reached (an INR of two to three is usually the aim). Lifestyle advice If you have thrombophilia, it's important you're aware of the symptoms of a blood clot (see above), and that you see your GP immediately if you think you have one. You should also take the following precautions to lower your risk of blood clots: lose weight if you're overweight stop smoking if you smoke eat a healthy, balanced diet and exercise regularly avoid being immobile for long periods because this can cause a DVT (read more about preventing DVT) If you're pregnant, or planning to get pregnant, discuss this with your GP and inform the midwife and obstetrician about your condition. You may need to take low-dose aspirin or an anticoagulant medicine while you're pregnant to prevent problems occurring during pregnancy or miscarriage. If you're having a major operation, make sure you tell the healthcare professionals treating you about your condition. You may need a heparin injection to prevent a blood clot forming. Women with thrombophilia should avoid taking the combined oral contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) because they'll further increase your risk of developing a blood clot. Formation of a blood clot (thrombus)  Who gets blood clots? Anyone can get a blood clot but people most at risk are those who are unwell for long periods and unable to move around very much. Blood clots are often linked to long-haul plane journeys or the contraceptive pill, but you're much more likely to develop one after going into hospital. About two-thirds of all blood clots occur during or just after a stay in hospital. Read more about how and why blood clots occur. You can also use the venous thromboembolism (VTE) self-assessment tool to assess your risk of blood clots.

Healthcare professionals often use the term \"syncope\" when referring to fainting, because it distinguishes fainting from other causes of temporary unconsciousness, such as seizures (fits) or concussion.  In most cases, when a person faints, they'll regain consciousness within a minute or two. However, less common types of fainting can be medical emergencies. Dial 999 to request an ambulance if a person who has fainted doesn't regain consciousness within two minutes. What causes a faint? To function properly, the brain relies on oxygen that's carried in the blood. Fainting can occur when the blood flow to the brain is reduced. Your body usually corrects reduced blood flow to the brain quickly, but it can make you feel odd, sweaty and dizzy. If it lasts long enough, you may faint. Read more about the symptoms of fainting. There are various reasons for a reduction in blood flow to the brain, but it's usually related to a temporary malfunction in the autonomic nervous system. This is the part of your nervous system that regulates the body's automatic functions, including heartbeat and blood pressure. This type of fainting is called \"neurally mediated syncope\". Neurally mediated syncope can be triggered by emotional stress, pain or prolonged standing. It can also be caused by physical processes such as coughing, sneezing or laughing. Read more about the causes of fainting. What to do if you or someone else faints If you feel you're about to faint, lie down, preferably in a position where your head is low and your legs are raised. This will encourage blood flow to your brain. If it's not possible to lie down, sit with your head between your knees. If you think someone is about to faint, you should help them to lie down or sit with their head between their knees. If a person faints and doesn't regain consciousness within one or two minutes, put them into the recovery position. To do this: place them on their side so they're supported by one leg and one arm open their airway by tilting their head back and lifting their chin monitor their breathing and pulse continuously You should then dial 999, ask for an ambulance and stay with the person until medical help arrives. Treatment for fainting In most cases, a person will return to normal within a few minutes of fainting, and no further treatment will be needed. If a person experiences repeated episodes of fainting, it's important for a healthcare professional to investigate the cause. Read more about the diagnosis of fainting. Treatment for fainting will depend on the type you're experiencing. In many cases of neurally mediated syncope, no further treatment is needed. If you've had a fainting episode, advice to deal with possible future fainting episodes includes: avoiding triggers \u2013 such as hot and crowded environments, or emotional stress spotting the warning signs \u2013 such as feeling lightheaded lying down to increase blood flow to the brain Read more about how fainting is treated.  Reduced blood flow to the brain can make you feel odd, sweaty and dizzy  Who is affected by fainting? Fainting is very common, affecting up to 4 in 10 people at least once during their lifetime. Most people experience their first episode of fainting before the age of 40. If your first episode occurs after 40, it may be a sign of a serious underlying problem. Neurally mediated syncope is the most common type of fainting. It often occurs for the first time during the teenage years and affects girls more than boys.

Falls are a common, but often overlooked, cause of injury. Around one in three adults over 65 who live at home will have at least one fall a year, and about half of these will have more frequent falls. Most falls don't result in serious injury. However, there's always a risk that a fall could lead to broken bones, and it can cause the person to lose confidence, become withdrawn and feel as if they've lost their independence. What should I do if I fall? If you have a fall, it's important to keep calm. If you're not hurt and you feel strong enough to get up, don't get up quickly. Roll onto your hands and knees and look for a stable piece of furniture, such as a chair or bed. Hold on to the furniture with both hands to support yourself and, when you feel ready, slowly get up. Sit down and rest for a while before carrying on with your daily activities. If you're hurt or unable to get up, try to get someone's attention by calling out for help, banging on the wall or floor, or using your aid call button (if you have one). If possible, crawl to a telephone and dial 999 to request an ambulance. Try to reach something warm, such as a blanket or dressing gown, to put over you, particularly your legs and feet. Stay as comfortable as possible and try to change your position at least once every half an hour or so. If you're living with or caring for an elderly person, see accidents and first aid for information and advice about what to do after an accident. What causes a fall? The natural ageing process means that older people have an increased risk of having a fall. In the UK, falls are the most common cause of injury related deaths in people over the age of 75. Older people are more likely to have a fall because they may have: balance problems and muscle weakness  poor vision a long-term health condition, such as heart disease, dementia or low blood pressure (hypotension), which can lead to dizziness and a brief loss of consciousness A fall is also more likely to happen when: the floor is wet or recently polished, such as in the bathroom the lighting in the room is dim rugs or carpets aren't properly secured the person is reaching for storage areas, such as a cupboard, or is going down stairs the person is rushing to get to the toilet during the day or at night Another common cause of falls, particularly among older men, is falling from a ladder while carrying out home maintenance work. In older people, falls can be particularly problematic because osteoporosis is a fairly common problem. Osteoporosis can develop in both men and women, particularly in people who smoke, drink excessive amounts of alcohol, take steroid medication or have a family history of hip fractures. However, older women are most at risk, because it's often associated with the hormonal changes that occur during the menopause. Preventing a fall There are several measures you can take to help prevent a fall. Simple everyday measures around the home include: using non-slip mats in the bathroom mopping up spills to prevent wet, slippery floors getting help lifting or moving items that are heavy or difficult to lift Removing clutter and ensuring all areas of the home are well lit can also help to prevent falls. The charity Age UK has advice about how to make tasks easier around the home. Healthcare professionals take falls in older people very seriously, because of the huge consequences they can have for the health and wellbeing of this group. As a result, there's a great deal of help and support available for older people, and it's worth asking your GP about the various options. Your GP may carry out some simple tests to check your balance. They can also review any medicines you're taking, in case their side effects may increase your risk of falling. Your GP may also recommend: having a sight test if you're having problems with your vision, even if you already wear glasses having an electrocardiogram (ECG) and checking your blood pressure while lying and standing  requesting a home hazard assessment, where a healthcare professional visits your home to identify potential hazards and offer advice doing exercises to improve your strength and balance (try some exercises for older people) Read more about preventing falls.

They fit snugly over the gums to replace missing teeth and eliminate potential problems caused by gaps.  Gaps left by missing teeth can cause problems with eating and speech, and teeth either side of the gap may grow into the space at an angle. Sometimes, all the teeth need to be removed and replaced. You may therefore need either: complete dentures (a full set) \u2013 which replace all your upper or lower teeth, or partial dentures \u2013 which replace just one tooth or a few missing teeth Dentures can help to prevent problems with eating and speech and, if you need complete dentures, they can also improve the appearance of your smile and give you confidence. This page provides information for anyone who's considering dentures and advice for those who already wear them. It explains: how dentures are fitted  how to look after your dentures  when to see your dentist  How dentures are fitted Complete dentures A full denture will be fitted if all your upper or lower teeth need to be removed or you're having an old complete denture replaced. The denture will usually be fitted as soon as your teeth are removed, which means you won't be without teeth. The denture will fit snugly over your gums and jawbone. However, if you have dentures fitted immediately after the removal of several teeth, the gums and bone will alter in shape fairly quickly and the dentures will probably need relining or remaking after a few months. Occasionally, your gums may need to be left to heal and alter in shape for several months before dentures can be fitted. You can either see a dentist or a qualified clinical dental technician to have your dentures made and fitted. The difference between a dentist and a clinical dental technician (in terms of producing dentures) is outlined below. A dentist \u2013 will take measurements and impressions (moulds) of your mouth, and then order your full or partial dentures from a dental technician.  A clinical dental technician \u2013 will provide a full set of dentures directly without you having to see your dentist (although you should still have regular dental check-ups with your dentist).  A trial denture will be created from the impressions taken of your mouth. The dentist or clinical dental technician will try this in your mouth to assess the fit and for you to assess the appearance. The shape and colour may be adjusted before the final denture is produced. Partial dentures A partial denture is designed to fill in the gaps left by one or more missing teeth. It's a plastic, nylon or metal plate with a number of false teeth attached to it. It usually clips onto some of your natural teeth via metal clasps, which hold it securely in place in your mouth. It can easily be unclipped and removed. Occasionally, the clips can be made of a tooth- or gum-coloured material, although this type of clip isn't always suitable, because it tends to be more brittle than metal. Your dentist can measure your mouth and order a partial denture for you, or you can see a qualified clinical dental technician, who can provide a partial denture for you directly after you've first seen your dentist for a treatment plan and certificate of oral health. The British Dental Health Foundation website has more information and advice about bridges and partial dentures, including which type of denture (metal or plastic) is best for you. A fixed bridge is an alternative to a partial denture and may be suitable for some people. Crowns are put on the teeth either side of the gap and joined together by a false tooth that's put in the gap.  Looking after your dentures Dentures may feel a bit strange to begin with, but you'll soon get used to wearing them. At first, you may need to wear your dentures all the time, including while sleeping. Your dentist or clinical dental technician will advise you on whether you should remove your dentures before you go to sleep.  It isn't always necessary to remove your dentures at night, but doing so can allow your gums to rest as you sleep. If you remove your dentures, they should be kept moist \u2013 for example, in water or a polythene bag with some dampened cotton wool in it, or in a suitable overnight denture-cleaning solution. This will stop the denture material from drying out and changing shape. Dental hygiene Keeping your mouth clean is just as important when you wear dentures. You should brush your remaining teeth, gums and tongue every morning and evening with fluoride toothpaste to prevent tooth decay, gum disease and other dental problems. Read more about how to keep your teeth clean. Cleaning dentures It's important to regularly remove plaque and food deposits from your dentures, because unclean dentures can also lead to problems, such as bad breath, gum disease, tooth decay and oral thrush. Clean your dentures as often as you would normal teeth (at least twice a day \u2013 every morning and night). You should: brush your dentures with toothpaste or soap and water before soaking them to remove food particles soak them in a fizzy solution of denture-cleaning tablets to remove stains and bacteria (follow the manufacturer's instructions) brush them again, as you would your normal teeth (but don't scrub them too hard) Dentures may break if you drop them, so you should clean them over a bowl or sink filled with water, or something soft such as a folded towel. The British Dental Health Foundation website has more information on denture cleaning. Eating with dentures When you first start wearing dentures, you should eat soft foods cut into small pieces and chew slowly, using both sides of your mouth. Avoid chewing gum and any food that's sticky, hard or has sharp edges. You can gradually start to eat other types of food until you're back to your old diet. Never use toothpicks. Denture adhesive If your dentures fit properly, you shouldn't necessarily need to use denture fixative (adhesive). However, if your jawbone has shrunk significantly, adhesive may be the only way to help retain your dentures. Your dentist or clinical dental technician will advise you if this is the case. At first, some people feel more confident with their dentures if they use adhesive. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and avoid using excessive amounts. Adhesive can be removed from the denture by brushing with soap and water. Remnants of adhesive left in the mouth may need to be removed with some damp kitchen roll or a clean damp flannel. When to see your dentist You should continue to see your dentist regularly if you have dentures (even if you have complete dentures) so they can check for any problems. Your dentures should last several years if you take good care of them. However, your gums and jawbone will eventually shrink, which means the dentures may not fit as well as they used to and can become loose, or they may become worn. See your dentist as soon as possible if: your dentures click when you're talking your dentures tend to slip, or you feel they no longer fit properly your dentures feel uncomfortable your dentures are visibly worn you have signs of gum disease or tooth decay, such as bleeding gums or bad breath If poorly fitting or worn dentures aren't replaced, they can cause great discomfort and lead to mouth sores, infections or problems eating and speaking.

But occasionally they can become infected, cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or spread serious illnesses such as Lyme disease and malaria. Bugs that bite or sting include wasps, hornets, bees, horseflies, ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, spiders and midges. This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you've been bitten or stung When to get medical advice When to get emergency medical help Prevention Symptoms of insect bites and stings Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Some people have a mild allergic reaction and a larger area of skin around the bite or sting becomes swollen, red and painful. This should pass within a week. Occasionally, a severe allergic reaction can occur, causing symptoms such as breathing difficulties, dizziness and a swollen face or mouth. This requires immediate medical treatment (see below). Read more about the symptoms of common insect bites and stings. What to do if you've been bitten or stung To treat an insect bite or sting: Remove the sting or tick if it's still in the skin (see treating insect bites and stings for advice about how to do this safely). Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they're unlikely to help. The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. Ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments that can help, such as painkillers, creams for itching and antihistamines. Read more about treatments for insect bites and stings. When to get medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if: you're worried about a bite or sting your symptoms don't start to improve within a few days or are getting worse you've been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes a large area (around 10cm or more) around the bite becomes red and swollen you have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness you have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a fever, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms When to get emergency medical help Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe reaction, such as: wheezing or difficulty breathing a swollen face, mouth or throat nausea or vomiting a fast heart rate dizziness or feeling faint difficulty swallowing loss of consciousness Emergency treatment in hospital is needed in these cases. Prevent insect bites and stings There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin \u2013 repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants \u2013 these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. You may need to take extra precautions if you're travelling to part of the world where there's a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about how to prevent insect bites and stings.

The aim is to remove unwanted fat from one area (such as the tummy or thighs) and use it to smoothen or increase the size of another area (such as the breasts or face). Although it's a relatively minor procedure, choosing to have it done is a big decision. It can be expensive, the results can\u2019t be guaranteed, and there are risks to consider. It's a good idea to explore the other options for losing fat before you go ahead. You may also want to read \"Is cosmetic surgery right for me?\" Read on to find out: How much does it cost?  Where do I go?  What does it involve?  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems   More information  How much does it cost? In the UK, a surgical fat transfer usually costs between £2,000 and £6,500, depending on the size of the area being treated. There may be additional costs for consultations, aftercare and any further treatment sessions you need. Where do I go? If you're looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform a surgical fat transfer. All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC, which publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care.  You should also research the surgeon who is going to carry out your surgery. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor\u2019s fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many operations they've performed where there have been complications what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong their own patient satisfaction rates Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? A surgical fat transfer can be carried out under either general anaesthetic or local anaesthetic. It involves three main stages: Removing the fat. Small incisions (cuts) are made in the skin and a thin tube is used to suck out small amounts of fat (similar to liposuction). The incisions are then closed with stitches and a small dressing placed over them. Preparing the fat. Special equipment is used to quickly spin the fat, to separate it from any blood and other fluids. Injecting the fat. A needle and syringe are used to inject small amounts of fat into the treatment area. The injections are given through tiny holes in the skin, so stitches aren\u2019t usually needed. The procedure usually lasts a couple of hours. You may be able to go home soon after the procedure is finished, or you may need to stay in hospital overnight. If a large area is being treated, your treatment may need to be carried out over two or more sessions. You shouldn\u2019t feel much pain during the procedure, but you may have some for a few days or weeks afterwards. You\u2019ll be given painkillers if you need them. Recovery You\u2019ll need to arrange for someone to drive you home after the procedure. You can start driving again when you\u2019re able to do so without experiencing any discomfort. The treated areas will probably be quite bruised and swollen for a week or two. You may want to take a couple of weeks off work. It can take up to six months for a surgical fat transfer to fully take effect, as some of the injected fat may be reabsorbed by your body during the first few months after the procedure. Side effects to expect It\u2019s common after a surgical fat transfer to have: significant bruising and swelling temporary numbness small scars \u2013 these will fade, but won\u2019t completely disappear loss of some of the fat from the injected area during the first few months What could go wrong A surgical fat transfer is generally a safe procedure, but it can occasionally result in: a collection of blood underneath the skin (haematoma) death of fat tissue (fat necrosis) a blockage in a blood vessel caused by a piece of fat (fat embolism) air leaking into the space between your lungs and chest wall (pneumothorax) thick, obvious scars \u2013 sometimes known as hypertrophic scars Any operation also carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding developing a blood clot in a vein infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, people find the desired effect wasn\u2019t achieved and feel they need another operation. What to do if you have problems Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. If you notice any problems during your recovery, such as signs of a possible infection (increasing swelling, redness or pain), go back to the surgeon who treated you. If you are not happy with the results, or think the procedure wasn't carried out properly, you should take up the matter with your surgeon through the hospital or clinic where you were treated. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the GMC.

It's usually seen in people who are overweight or obese. A healthy liver should contain little or no fat. It's estimated that up to one in every three people in the UK has early stages of NAFLD where there are small amounts of fat in their liver. Early-stage NAFLD doesn't usually cause any harm, but it can lead to serious liver damage, including cirrhosis, if it gets worse. Having high levels of fat in your liver is also associated with an increased risk of problems such as diabetes, heart attacks and strokes. If detected and managed at an early stage, it's possible to stop NAFLD getting worse and reduce the amount of fat in your liver. This page covers: Stages of NAFLD Am I at risk of NAFLD? Symptoms of NAFLD How NAFLD is diagnosed Treatment for NAFLD Stages of NAFLD NAFLD develops in four main stages. Most people will only ever develop the first stage, usually without realising it. In small number of cases it can progress and eventually lead to liver damage if not detected and managed. The main stages of NAFLD are: simple fatty liver (steatosis) \u2013 a largely harmless build-up of fat in the liver cells that may only be diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) \u2013 a more serious form of NAFLD, where the liver has become inflamed; this is estimated to affect up to 5% of the UK population fibrosis \u2013 where persistent inflammation causes scar tissue around the liver and nearby blood vessels, but the liver is still able to function normally cirrhosis \u2013 the most severe stage, occurring after years of inflammation, where the liver shrinks and becomes scarred and lumpy; this damage is permanent and can lead to liver failure (where your liver stops working properly) and liver cancer It can take years for fibrosis or cirrhosis to develop. It's important to make lifestyle changes to prevent the disease from getting worse. Am I at risk of NAFLD? You're at an increased risk of NAFLD if you: are obese or overweight \u2013 particularly if you have a lot of fat around your waist (an \"apple-like\" body shape) have type 2 diabetes have high blood pressure have high cholesterol are over the age of 50 smoke However, NAFLD has been diagnosed in people without any of these risk factors, including young children. Although it's very similar to alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), NAFLD isn't caused by drinking too much alcohol. Symptoms of NAFLD There aren't usually any symptoms of NAFLD in the early stages. You probably won't know you have it unless it's diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason. Occasionally, people with NASH or fibrosis (more advanced stages of the disease) may experience: a dull or aching pain in the top right of the tummy (over the lower right side of the ribs) fatigue (extreme tiredness) unexplained weight loss weakness If cirrhosis (the most advanced stage) develops, you can get more severe symptoms such as yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), itchy skin, and swelling in the legs, ankles, feet or tummy. Read more about the symptoms of cirrhosis. How NAFLD is diagnosed NAFLD is often diagnosed after a blood test called a liver function test produces an abnormal result and other liver conditions, such as hepatitis, are ruled out. However, blood tests don't always pick up NAFLD. The condition may also be spotted during an ultrasound scan of your tummy. This is a type of scan where sound waves are used to create an image of the inside of your body. If you're diagnosed with NAFLD, further tests may be needed to determine which stage you have. This may involve a special blood test or having another type of ultrasound scan (Fibroscan). Some people may also need a small sample of liver tissue (biopsy) taken using a needle to have it analysed in a laboratory. Treatment for NAFLD Most people with NAFLD won't develop any serious problems, but if you're diagnosed with the condition it's a good idea to take steps to stop it getting any worse. There's currently no specific medication for NAFLD, but making healthy lifestyle choices can help and treatment may be recommended for associated conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol) or complications. You may be advised to have regular appointments with your doctor to check your liver function and look for signs of any new problems. Healthy diet and lifestyle Adopting a healthy lifestyle is the main way of managing NAFLD. The following can all help:  Lose weight \u2013 you should aim for a BMI of 18.5-24.9; use the BMI calculator to work out your BMI. Losing more than 10% of your weight can remove some fat from the liver and improve NASH if you have it. Eat a healthy diet \u2013 try to have a balanced diet high in fruits, vegetables, protein and carbohydrates, but low in fat, sugar and salt. Eating smaller portions of food can help too. Exercise regularly \u2013 aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, such as walking or cycling, a week. All types of exercise can help improve NAFLD, even if you don't lose weight. Stop smoking \u2013 if you smoke, stopping can help reduce your risk of problems such as heart attacks and strokes. NAFLD isn't caused by alcohol, but drinking may make the condition worse. It's therefore advisable to cut down or stop drinking alcohol. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol. Medication There isn't currently any medication that can treat NAFLD, but various medicines can be useful in managing the problems associated with the condition. For example, your doctor may recommend medication to treat high blood pressure, treat high cholesterol, treat type 2 diabetes and\/or treat obesity. Liver transplant If you develop severe cirrhosis and your liver stops working properly, you may need to be put on the waiting list for a liver transplant. For adults, the average waiting time for a liver transplant is 145 days for transplants from recently deceased donors. Alternatively, it may be possible to have a transplant using a section of liver removed from a living donor. As the liver can regenerate itself, both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor's liver are able to regrow to a normal size.

They are relatively common and, in most cases, aren't serious. Around one in 20 children will have at least one febrile seizure at some point. They most often occur between the ages of six months and three years. During a febrile seizure, the child's body usually becomes stiff, they lose consciousness and their arms and legs twitch. Some children may wet themselves. This is known as a tonic clonic seizure. Read more about the symptoms of febrile seizures. What to do during a seizure If your child is having a febrile seizure, place them in the recovery position. Lay them on their side, on a soft surface, with their face turned to one side. This will stop them swallowing any vomit, keep their airway open and help prevent injury. Stay with your child and try to make a note of how long the seizure lasts. If it's your child's first seizure, or it lasts longer than five minutes, take them to the nearest hospital as soon as possible, or dial 999 for an ambulance. While it's unlikely that there's anything seriously wrong, it's best to be sure. If your child has had febrile seizures before and the seizure lasts for less than five minutes, phone your GP or NHS 111 for advice. Don't put anything, including medication, in your child\u2019s mouth during a seizure because there's a slight chance that they might bite their tongue. Almost all children make a complete recovery after having a febrile seizure. Read more about diagnosing febrile seizures and treating febrile seizures. Types of febrile seizure There are two main types of febrile seizure. Simple febrile seizure A simple febrile seizure is the most common type of febrile seizure, accounting for about eight out of 10 cases. It's a fit that: is a tonic clonic seizure (see above) lasts less than 15 minutes doesn't reoccur within 24 hours or the period in which your child has an illness Complex febrile seizure Complex febrile seizures are less common, accounting for two out of 10 cases. A complex febrile seizure is any seizure that has one or more of the following features: the seizure lasts longer than 15 minutes your child only has symptoms in one part of their body (this is known as a partial or focal seizure) your child has another seizure within 24 hours of the first seizure, or during the same period of illness your child doesn't fully recover from the seizure within one hour Why febrile seizures occur The cause of febrile seizures is unknown, although they're linked to the start of a fever (a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above). In most cases, a high temperature is caused by an infection such as: chickenpox flu (influenza) middle ear infections (otitis media) tonsillitis There may also be a genetic link to febrile seizures because the chances of having a seizure are increased if a close family member has a history of them. Around one in four children affected by febrile seizures has a family history of the condition. Read more about the causes of febrile seizures. Complications Febrile seizures have been linked to an increased risk of epilepsy (see below), as well as other problems. Recent research findings may indicate a link between febrile seizures and sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC), possibly due to the connection between febrile seizures and epilepsy. However, this link hasn't been proven and SUDC is incredibly rare, affecting around one in 100,000 children which is equivalent to a 0.001% chance. In addition, one of the biggest studies of its kind looked at more than 1.5 million children with a history of febrile seizures and found no evidence of an increased risk of death in later childhood or adulthood. Febrile seizures and epilepsy Many parents worry that if their child has one or more febrile seizures, they'll develop epilepsy when they get older. Epilepsy is a condition where a person has repeated seizures without fever. While it's true that children who have a history of febrile seizures have an increased risk of developing epilepsy, it should be stressed that the risk is still small. It's estimated that children with a history of simple febrile seizures have a one in 50 chance of developing epilepsy in later life. Children with a history of complex febrile seizures have a one in 20 chance of developing epilepsy in later life. This is compared to around a one in 100 chance for people who haven't had febrile seizures. Fever and vomiting Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

Media last reviewed: 08\/07\/2015 Next review due: 08\/07\/2017 Frightening but harmless Seeing a child having a seizure, particularly if they have no previous history of fits, can be frightening and distressing for the parents. Many parents say they were convinced that their child was going to die. However, while febrile seizures may be frightening, most are harmless and don't pose a threat to a child\u2019s health.

Who gets smelly feet? Anyone can get smelly feet but they're more likely if you: are a teenager are pregnant are under mental or emotional stress stand up all day at work have a medical condition called hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)  are taking certain prescribed medications Medically known as bromodosis, stinky feet are a common year-round problem. The main cause is sweaty feet combined with wearing the same shoes every day. Why feet sweat Anyone can get sweaty feet, regardless of the temperature or time of year. But teenagers and pregnant women are especially prone because hormonal changes make them sweat more. You're also more likely to have foot perspiration if you're on your feet all day, if you're under a lot of stress or if you have a medical condition called hyperhidrosis, which makes you sweat more than usual. Fungal infections, such as athlete's foot, can also lead to bad foot odour. According to podiatrist, Lorraine Jones, feet become smelly if sweat soaks into shoes and they don't dry before you wear them again. Bacteria on the skin break down sweat as it comes from the pores. A cheesy odour is released as the sweat decomposes. \"Your feet sweat into your shoes all day so they get damp and bacteria start to grow. The bacteria continue to breed once you've taken your shoes off, especially if you put them in a dark cupboard. Then, when you put your shoes back on the next day, even if you've just had a shower, putting your feet into still damp shoes creates the perfect conditions for the bacteria to thrive \u2013 warm, dark and moist.\" How to treat smelly feet The good news is that there's a simple, quick, sure-fire solution to smelly feet. Wash your feet with an anti-bacterial soap called Hibiscrub. There are lots of over-the-counter foot hygiene products at your local chemist, but Hibiscrub is the best one. Leave on the Hibiscrub for a couple of minutes, then wash it off. According to Lorraine, \"if you do this twice a day, you'll definitely banish smelly feet within a week.\" She adds that you shouldn't use Hibiscrub on your feet if you have broken skin, such as eczema. Preventing smelly feet Keeping feet fresh and sweet smelling is all down to good personal hygiene and changing your shoes regularly. To keep feet fresh: Never wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row. Instead, wear different shoes on successive days so they have at least 24 hours to dry out. Make sure teenage boys have two pairs of trainers so that they don't have to wear the same pair for two or more consecutive days. Wash and dry your feet every day and change your socks (ideally wool or cotton, not nylon) at least once a day. Keep your toenails short and clean and remove any hard skin with a foot file. Hard skin can become soggy when damp, which provides an ideal home for bacteria If you're particularly susceptible to sweaty feet, it's a good idea to: dab between your toes with cotton wool dipped in surgical spirit after a shower or bath \u2013 surgical spirit helps dry out the skin between the toes really well \u2013 in addition to drying them with a towel use a spray deodorant or antiperspirant on your feet \u2013 a normal underarm deodorant or antiperspirant works just as well as a specialist foot product and will cost you less put medicated insoles, which have a deodorising effect, in your shoes try feet-fresh socks \u2013 some sports socks have ventilation panels to keep feet dry, and antibacterial socks are impregnated with chemicals to discourage the odour-producing bacteria that feed on sweat wear leather or canvas shoes, as they let your feet breathe, unlike plastic ones wear open-toed sandals in summer and go barefoot at home in the evenings When to see a doctor Smelly feet are a harmless problem that generally clears up. Sometimes, however, it can be a sign of a medical condition. See your GP if simple measures to reduce your foot odour don't help, or if you're worried that your level of sweating is abnormally high. Your doctor can offer you a strong prescription antiperspirant or refer you for a treatment called iontophoresis, which delivers a mild electric current through water to your feet to combat excessive sweating. Here are more tips on how to look after your feet. Top tip for prevention 'Never wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row. Instead, wear different shoes on successive days so they have a minimum of 24 hours to dry out'  Lorraine Jones, chiropodist     Page last reviewed: 11\/12\/2015 Next review due: 11\/12\/2017 More articles on: Foot health Share: Save: Subscribe:  Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's also known as \"female circumcision\" or \"cutting\", and by other terms such as sunna, gudniin, halalays, tahur, megrez and khitan, among others. FGM is usually carried out on young girls between infancy and the age of 15, most commonly before puberty starts. It is illegal in the UK and is child abuse. It's very painful and can seriously harm the health of women and girls. It can also cause long-term problems with sex, childbirth and mental health. Help and support is available if you've had FGM or you're worried that someone may be at risk. This page covers: Forms of FGM Effects of FGM Treatment for FGM (deinfibulation) Getting help and support Why it's carried out Where it's carried out The law and FGM Forms of FGM There are four main types of FGM: Type 1 (clitoridectomy) \u2013 removing part or all of the clitoris. Type 2 (excision) \u2013 removing part or all of the clitoris and the inner labia (lips that surround the vagina), with or without removal of the labia majora (larger outer lips). Type 3 (infibulation) \u2013 narrowing of the vaginal opening by creating a seal, formed by cutting and repositioning the labia. Other harmful procedures to the female genitals, including pricking, piercing, cutting, scraping or burning the area. FGM is often performed by traditional circumcisers or cutters who do not have any medical training. However, in some countries it may be done by a medical professional. Anaesthetics and antiseptics aren't generally used, and FGM is often carried out using knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razor blades. FGM often happens against a girl's will without her consent and girls may have to be forcibly restrained. Effects of FGM There are no health benefits to FGM and it can cause serious harm, including: constant pain pain and\/or difficulty having sex repeated infections, which can lead to infertility bleeding, cysts and abscesses problems passing urine or incontinence depression, flashbacks and self-harm  problems during labour and childbirth, which can be life-threatening for mother and baby Some girls die from blood loss or infection as a direct result of the procedure. FGM and sex FGM can make it difficult and painful to have sex. It can also result in reduced sexual desire and a lack of pleasurable sensation. Talk to your GP or another healthcare professional if you have sexual problems that you feel may be due to FGM, as they can refer you to a special therapist who can help. In some cases, a surgical procedure called a deinfibulation (see below) may be recommended, which can alleviate and improve some symptoms. FGM and pregnancy Some women with FGM may find it difficult to become pregnant, and those who do conceive can have problems in childbirth. If you're expecting a baby, your midwife should ask you at your antenatal appointment if you've had FGM. It's important to tell your midwife if you think this has happened to you, so they can arrange appropriate care for you and you baby. FGM and mental health FGM can be an extremely traumatic experience that can cause emotional difficulties throughout life, including; depression anxiety flashbacks to the time of the cutting nightmares and other sleep problems In some cases, women may not remember having the FGM at all, especially if it was performed when they were an infant. Talk to your GP or another healthcare professional if you're experiencing emotional or mental health problems that may be a result of FGM. Help and support is available. Treatment for FGM (deinfibulation) Surgery can be performed to open up the vagina, if necessary. This is called deinfibulation. It's sometimes known as a \"reversal\" although this name is misleading, as the procedure doesn\u2019t replace any removed tissue, and will not undo the damage caused. However, it can help many problems caused by FGM. Surgery may be recommended for: women who are unable to have sex or have difficulty passing urine  as a result of FGM pregnant women at risk of problems during labour or delivery as a result of FGM Deinfibulation should be carried out before getting pregnant, if possible. It can be done in pregnancy or labour if necessary, but ideally should be done before the last two months of pregnancy. The surgery involves making a cut (incision) to open the scar tissue over the entrance to the vagina. It's usually performed under local anaesthetic in a clinic and you won't normally need to stay overnight. A small number of women need either a general anaesthetic or spinal anaesthetic (injection in the back), which may involve a short stay in hospital. Getting help and support All women and girls have the right to control what happens to their bodies and the right to say no to FGM. Help is available if you've had FGM or you're worried that you or someone you know is at risk. If someone is in immediate danger, contact the police immediately by dialling 999. If you're concerned that someone may be at risk, contact the NSPCC helpline on 0800 028 3550 or fgmhelp@nspcc.org.uk. If you're under pressure to have FGM performed on your daughter, ask your GP, health visitor or other healthcare professional for help, or contact the NSPCC helpline. If you've had FGM, you can get help from a specialist NHS gynaecologist or FGM service \u2013 ask your GP, midwife or any other healthcare professional about services in your area. Download a list of NHS FGM clinics (PDF, 430kb). If you're a health professional caring for a patient under 18 who has undergone FGM, you have professional responsibilities to safeguard and protect her. Guidance and resources about FGM for healthcare staff are available on the GOV.UK website. Why FGM is carried out FGM is carried out for various cultural, religious and social reasons within families and communities in the mistaken belief that it will benefit the girl in some way (for example, as a preparation for marriage or to preserve her virginity). However, there are no acceptable reasons that justify FGM. It's a harmful practice that isn't required by any religion and there are no religious texts that say it should be done. There are no health benefits of FGM. FGM usually happens to girls whose mothers, grandmothers or extended female family members have had FGM themselves or if their father comes from a community where it's carried out. Where FGM is carried out Girls are sometimes taken abroad for FGM, but they may not be aware that this is the reason for their travel. Girls are more at risk of FGM being carried out during the summer holidays, as this allows more time for them to \"heal\" before they return to school. If you think there's a risk of this happening to you, you can download the Statement Opposing FGM and take it with you on holiday to show your family. Communities that perform FGM are found in many parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Girls who were born in the UK or are resident here but whose families originate from an FGM practising community are at greater risk of FGM happening to them. Communities at particular risk of FGM in the UK originate from: Egypt Eritrea Ethiopia Gambia Guinea Indonesia Ivory Coast Kenya Liberia Malaysia Mali Nigeria Sierra Leone Somalia Sudan Yemen The law and FGM FGM is illegal in the UK. It is an offence to: perform FGM (including taking a child abroad for FGM) help a girl perform FGM on herself in or outside the UK help anyone perform FGM in the UK help anyone perform FGM outside the UK on a UK national or resident fail to protect a girl for whom you are responsible from FGM Anyone who performs FGM can face up to 14 years in prison. Anyone found guilty of failing to protect a girl from FGM can face up to seven years in prison. Download the Statement Opposing FGM The summer holidays are when many young girls are taken abroad, often to their family's birth country, to have FGM performed. The FGM statement, also known as the FGM health passport, highlights the fact that FGM is a serious criminal offence in the UK. If you're worried about FGM, print out this statement, take it abroad with you and show it to your family. Keep the declaration in your passport, purse or bag, and carry it with you all the time. Download the 2015 FGM statement \u2013 English version (PDF, 218kb). There are also versions of the statement in other languages on the GOV.UK website. Leaflets to download The Department of Health has published leaflets for patients who want to know more about FGM.

Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is female sterilisation. At a glance: female sterilisation   How it works   Who can have it done   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks of female sterilisation   Where you can get it Female sterilisation is usually carried out under general anaesthetic, but can be carried out under local anaesthetic, depending on the method used. The surgery involves blocking or sealing the fallopian tubes, which link the ovaries to the womb (uterus).  This prevents the woman\u2019s eggs from reaching sperm and becoming fertilised. Eggs will still be released from the ovaries as normal, but they will be absorbed naturally into the woman's body.   At a glance: facts about female sterilisation In most cases, female sterilisation is more than 99% effective, and only one woman in 200 will become pregnant in her lifetime after having it done.  You don't have to think about it every day, or every time you have sex, so it doesn't interrupt or affect your sex life.  Sterilisation can be carried out at any stage of the menstrual cycle. It won't affect hormone levels. You'll still have periods after being sterilised. You will need to use contraception until the operation is done and until your next period or for three months afterwards (depending on the type of sterilisation). As with any surgery, there's a small risk of complications. These include internal bleeding, infection or damage to other organs.  There's a small risk that the operation won't work. Blocked tubes can rejoin immediately or years later.  If the operation fails, this may increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy (when a fertilised egg implants outside the womb, usually in a fallopian tube).  The sterilisation operation is difficult to reverse. Female sterilisation doesn't protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so always use a condom to protect yourself and your partner against them. How female sterilisation works Female sterilisation works by preventing eggs from travelling down the fallopian tubes. This means a woman's eggs cannot meet sperm, and fertilisation cannot happen. How female sterilisation is carried out  Before the operation Recovering after the operation How female sterilisation is carried out There are two main types of female sterilisation: when your fallopian tubes are blocked \u2013 for example, with clips or rings (tubal occlusion)   when implants are used to block your fallopian tubes (hysteroscopic sterilisation, or HS)  It can be a fairly minor operation, with many women returning home the same day. Sterilisation is usually carried out using tubal occlusion. Tubal occlusion First, your surgeon will need to access and examine your fallopian tubes, using either laparoscopy or mini-laparotomy. A laparoscopy is the most common method of accessing the fallopian tubes. The surgeon makes a small cut in your abdominal wall near your belly button and inserts a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a small flexible tube that contains a tiny light and camera. The camera relays images of the inside of your body to a television monitor. This allows the surgeon to see your fallopian tubes clearly. A mini-laparotomy involves a small incision, usually less than 5cm (2 inches), just above the pubic hairline. Your surgeon can then access your fallopian tubes through this incision. A laparoscopy is usually the preferred option because it is faster. However, a mini-laparotomy may be recommended for women who: have had recent abdominal or pelvic surgery are obese (have a body mass index of 30 or over)  have a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (a bacterial infection that can affect the womb and fallopian tubes) Blocking the tubes The fallopian tubes can be blocked using one of the following methods: applying clips \u2013 plastic or titanium clamps are closed over the fallopian tubes  applying rings \u2013 a small loop of the fallopian tube is pulled through a silicone ring, then clamped shut  tying and cutting the tube \u2013 this destroys 3-4cm (1-1.5 inches) of the tube Hysteroscopic sterilisation (fallopian implants) You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people's services Find a clinic near you The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published guidance about hysteroscopic sterilisation. In the UK, the brand name of the hysteroscopic sterilisation technique is Essure. The procedure doesn't require cuts to be made in your abdomen so general anaesthetic is not required. Though you may be given a painkiller and \/or a local anaesthetic. A narrow tube with a telescope at the end, called a hysteroscope, is passed through your vagina and cervix. A guidewire is used to insert a tiny piece of titanium metal (called a microinsert) into the hysteroscope, then into each of your fallopian tubes. This means that the surgeon does not need to cut into your body. The implant causes the fallopian tube to form scar tissue around it, which eventually blocks the tube. You should carry on using contraception until an imaging test has confirmed that your fallopian tubes are blocked. This can be done with one or more of the following:  a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) \u2013 a type of X-ray that is taken after a special dye has been injected to show up any blockages in your fallopian tubes  a hysterosalpingo-contrast-sonography (HyCoSy) \u2013 a type of ultrasound scan involving injecting dye into your fallopian tubes The manufacturer of Essure now advises that ultrasound scan is an additional option for checking placement of the implants 3 months after the sterilisation procedure. If the coils of the implant are seen to be in the correct position tubal occlusion can be assumed Removing the tubes (salpingectomy) If blocking the fallopian tubes has been unsuccessful, the tubes may be completely removed. Removal of the tubes is called salpingectomy. Before the operation Your GP will strongly recommend counselling before referring you for sterilisation. Ideally, this should be with you and your partner if appropriate and acceptable. If possible, you should both agree to the procedure, but it is not a legal requirement to get your partner\u2019s permission. Counselling will give you a chance to talk about the operation in detail, and talk about any doubts, worries or questions that you might have. Your GP does have the right to refuse to carry out the procedure or refuse to refer you for the procedure if they do not believe that it is in your best interests. If this is the case, you may have to pay to have a sterilisation privately. If you decide to be sterilised, your GP will usually refer you to a specialist for treatment. This will usually be a gynaecologist at your nearest NHS hospital. A gynaecologist is a specialist in the female reproductive system. If you choose to have a sterilisation, you will be asked to use contraception until the day of the operation, and to continue using it:  until your next period if you are having your fallopian tubes blocked (tubal occlusion)   for around three months if you are having fallopian implants (hysteroscopic sterilisation) Sterilisation can be performed at any stage in your menstrual cycle. Before you have the operation, you will be given a pregnancy test to make sure that you are not pregnant. It is vital to know this because once the surgeon blocks your fallopian tubes, there is a high risk that any pregnancy will become ectopic (when the fertilised egg grows outside the womb, usually in the fallopian tubes). An ectopic pregnancy can be life-threatening because it can cause severe internal bleeding. Recovering after the operation Once you have recovered from the anaesthetic, passed urine and had something to eat, you will be allowed home. If you leave hospital within hours of the operation, ask a relative or friend to pick you up, or take a taxi. The healthcare professionals treating you in hospital will tell you what to expect and how to care for yourself after surgery. They may give you a contact number to call if you have any problems or any questions. If you have had a general anaesthetic, do not drive a car for 48 hours afterwards. This is because even if you feel fine, your reaction times and judgement may not be back to normal. How you will feel It is normal to feel unwell and a little uncomfortable for a few days if you have had a general anaesthetic, and you may have to rest for a couple of days. Depending on your general health and your job, you can normally return to work five days after tubal occlusion. However, you should avoid heavy lifting for about a week. You may have some slight vaginal bleeding. Use a sanitary towel rather than a tampon until this has gone. You may also feel some pain, similar to period pain. You may be prescribed painkillers for this. If the pain or bleeding gets worse, seek medical attention. Caring for your wound If you had tubal occlusion to block your fallopian tubes, you will have a wound with stitches where the surgeon made an incision (cut) into your stomach. Some stitches are dissolvable and disappear on their own, and some will need to be removed. If your stitches need removing, you will be given a follow-up appointment for this. If there is a dressing over your wound, you can normally remove this the day after your operation. After this, you will be able to have a bath or shower as normal. Having sex Your sex drive and enjoyment of sex will not be affected. You can have sex as soon as it is comfortable to do so after the operation. If you had tubal occlusion, you will need to use contraception until your first period to protect yourself from pregnancy. If you had hysteroscopic sterilisation, you will need to use another form of contraception for around three months after surgery. After scans have confirmed that the implants are in the correct position, you will no longer need contraception. Sterilisation will not protect you from STIs, so continue to use barrier contraception such as condoms if you are unsure of your partner's sexual health. Who can have it done? Almost any woman can be sterilised. However, sterilisation should only be considered by women who do not want any more children, or do not want children at all. Once you are sterilised it is very difficult to reverse the process, so it's important to consider the other options available before making your decision. Sterilisation reversal is not usually available on the NHS. Surgeons are more willing to perform sterilisation when women are over 30 years old and have had children, although some younger women who have never had a baby choose it. Advantages and disadvantages of female sterilisation Advantages female sterilisation can be more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy tubal occlusion (blocking the fallopian tubes) and removal of the tubes (salpingectomy) should be effective immediately \u2013 however, doctors strongly recommend that you continue to use contraception until your next period hysteroscopic sterilisation is usually effective after around three months \u2013 research collected by NICE found that the fallopian tubes were blocked after three months in 96% of sterilised women Other advantages of female sterilisation are that: there are rarely any long-term effects on your sexual health it will not affect your sex drive it will not affect the spontaneity of sexual intercourse or interfere with sex (as other forms of contraception can) it will not affect your hormone levels Disadvantages female sterilisation does not protect you against STIs, so you should still use a condom if you are unsure about your partner's sexual health  it is very difficult to reverse a tubal occlusion \u2013 this involves removing the blocked part of the fallopian tube and rejoining the ends, and reversal operations are rarely funded by the NHS a 2015 US study found that around 1 in 50 women who had a hysteroscopic sterilisation required further surgery due to complications such as persistent pain  Risks with tubal occlusion, there is a very small risk of complications, including internal bleeding and infection or damage to other organs it is possible for sterilisation to fail \u2013 the fallopian tubes can rejoin and make you fertile again, although this is rare (about one in 200 women become pregnant in their lifetime after being sterilised) if you do get pregnant after the operation, there is an increased risk that it will be an ectopic pregnancy (when the fertilised egg grows outside the womb, usually in the fallopian tubes) If you miss a period, take a pregnancy test immediately. If the pregnancy test is positive, you must see your GP so that you can be referred for a scan to check if the pregnancy is inside or outside your womb. With hysteroscopic sterilisation, there is a small risk of pregnancy even after your tubes have been blocked. Research collected by NICE has shown that possible complications after fallopian implants can include: pain after the operation \u2013 in one study, nearly eight out of 10 women reported pain afterwards the implants being inserted incorrectly \u2013 this affected two out of 100 women   bleeding after the operation \u2013 many women had light bleeding after the operation, and nearly a third had bleeding for three days Where to get contraception Most types of contraception are available free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. You can get contraception, and information and advice about contraception, at: most GP surgeries \u2013 talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraceptive clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics  sexual health clinics \u2013 they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people\u2019s services (call 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic.  Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won't tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.   Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 05\/01\/2015 Next review due: 05\/01\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Your muscles are usually strong and tight enough to keep your intestines and organs in place, but a hernia can develop if there are any weak spots. What is a femoral hernia? A femoral hernia is an uncommon type of hernia. It's estimated that only about 1 in every 20 groin hernias are femoral hernias, and the rest are inguinal hernias. Femoral hernias sometimes appear as a painful lump in the inner upper part of the thigh or groin. The lump can often be pushed back in or disappears when you lie down. Coughing or straining may make the lump appear. For information on other types of hernia, see:  inguinal hernia hiatus hernia umbilical hernia What causes a femoral hernia? A femoral hernia usually occurs when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh. It pushes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle wall (abdominal wall) into an area called the femoral canal. Unlike inguinal hernias, femoral hernias occur far more frequently in women, particularly older women. This is because of the wider shape of the female pelvis. Femoral hernias are rare in children. Femoral hernias can sometimes appear suddenly because of strain on the abdomen, such as: straining on the toilet if you have constipation carrying and pushing heavy loads They've also been linked to obesity and having a persistent, heavy cough. When is surgery needed? Femoral hernias can be repaired using surgery to push the bulge back into place and strengthen the weakness in the abdominal wall. Unlike some other types of hernia, treatment of femoral hernias is almost always recommended straight away because there's a higher risk of complications developing in these cases. Complications that can develop as a result of a femoral hernia include: obstruction \u2013 where a section of the bowel becomes stuck in the femoral canal, causing nausea, vomiting and stomach pain, as well as a painful lump in the groin strangulation \u2013 where a section of bowel becomes trapped and its blood supply is cut off; this requires emergency surgery within hours to release the trapped tissue and restore its blood supply, so it doesn't die Surgery gets rid of the hernia and prevents any serious complications, although there's a chance of it returning after the operation. What happens during surgery? There are two ways a femoral hernia repair can be performed: open surgery \u2013 where one cut is made to allow the surgeon to push the lump back into the abdomen laparoscopy (keyhole) surgery \u2013 a less invasive, but more difficult, technique where several smaller cuts are made, allowing the surgeon to use various special instruments to repair the hernia There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods. The type of surgery you have depends on which method suits you and your surgeon\u2019s experience. You should be able to go home the same day or the day after surgery. It's important to follow the hospital's instructions on how to look after yourself. This includes eating a good diet to avoid constipation, caring for the wound and not straining yourself too soon. Most people make a full recovery from femoral hernia repair within six weeks, although many people can return to driving, work and light activities within two weeks. Read more about: how femoral hernia repair is performed recovering from femoral hernia repair Are there any risks from the operation? Femoral hernia repair is a routine operation with very few risks, although around 1% of hernias return after the operation. Other uncommon complications of femoral hernia repair include: developing a lump under the wound difficulty passing urine injury or narrowing of the femoral vein (which passes through the femoral canal) injury to the bowel temporary weakness of the leg injury to the nerves, causing pain or numbness in the groin area Complications are more likely if you're over 50 or have another illness, such as heart disease or breathing problems.

Around one in seven couples may have difficulty conceiving. This is approximately 3.5 million people in the UK. About 84% of couples will conceive naturally within one year if they have regular unprotected sex. For every 100 couples trying to conceive naturally: 84 will conceive within one year 92 will conceive within two years  93 will conceive within three years For couples who have been trying to conceive for more than three years without success, the likelihood of pregnancy occurring within the next year is 25% or less. Deciding to seek help Some women get pregnant quickly, but for others it can take longer. It is a good idea for a couple to visit their GP if they have not conceived after one year of trying. Women aged 36 and over, and anyone who is already aware they may have fertility problems, should see their GP sooner. The GP can check for common causes of fertility problems, and suggest treatments that could help. A couple will only be diagnosed as being infertile if they have not managed to have a baby after one year of trying. There are two types of infertility: primary infertility \u2013 where someone who has never conceived a child in the past has difficulty conceiving secondary infertility \u2013 where a person has had one or more pregnancies in the past, but is having difficulty conceiving again Read more information about how infertility is diagnosed. What causes infertility? There are many potential causes of infertility, and fertility problems can affect either the man or the woman. However, it is not always possible to identify the cause. Common causes of infertility in women include lack of regular ovulation (the monthly release of an egg), blockage of the fallopian tubes and endometriosis. However, for 25% of couples, the cause is unexplained. In men, the most common cause is poor quality of semen (the fluid containing sperm that is ejaculated during sex). For some people, leading a healthy lifestyle and staying up to date with regular health checks and tests may help to prevent infertility. What treatment is available? Types of fertility treatment available include: medical treatment for lack of regular ovulation surgical procedures \u2013 such as treatment for endometriosis assisted conception \u2013 which may be intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) The treatment offered will depend on what is causing your fertility problems and what is available from your local CCG. You may wish to consider private treatment. This can be expensive, and there is no guarantee it will be successful. It is important to choose a private clinic carefully. You can ask your GP for advice, and you should make sure you choose a clinic that is licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Read more about how infertility is treated. Some types of infertility treatment can cause complications, including: side effects of medication increased risk of ectopic pregnancy multiple pregnancy stress Read more about complications associated with infertility treatments.

As a general rule, in children a temperature of over 37.5C (99.5F) is a fever. As a parent it can be extremely worrying if your child has a high temperature. However, it's very common and often clears up by itself without treatment.  A quick and easy way to find out whether your child has a fever is to take their temperature using a thermometer. What causes a high temperature? Most fevers are caused by infections or other illnesses. The high body temperature makes it more difficult for the bacteria and viruses that cause infections to survive. Common conditions that can cause fevers include: upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs) flu ear infections roseola \u2013 a virus that causes a temperature and a rash  tonsillitis kidney or urinary tract infections (UTIs) common childhood illnesses, such as chickenpox and whooping cough Your child's temperature can also be raised after vaccinations, or if they overheat because of too much bedding or clothing. When to seek urgent medical advice Contact your GP or health visitor urgently if your child: is under three months old and has a temperature of 38C (101F) or above is between three and six months old and has a temperature of 39C (102F) or above You should also see your GP if your child has other signs of being unwell, such as persistent vomiting, refusal to feed, floppiness or drowsiness. If it isn't possible to contact your GP, call your local out-of-hours service or NHS 111. If your child seems to be otherwise well \u2013 for example, if they're playing and attentive \u2013 it's less likely they're seriously ill.  Treating a fever If your child has a fever, it's important to keep them hydrated by giving them plenty of cool water to drink. Babies should be given plenty of liquids, such as breast milk or formula. Even if your child isn't thirsty, try to get them to drink little and often to keep their fluid levels up. If the environment is warm, you could help to your child to stay at a comfortable temperature by covering them with a lightweight sheet or opening a window. However, they should still be appropriately dressed for their surroundings and sponging your child with cool water isn't recommended to reduce a fever. Antipyretics Children's paracetamol or ibuprofen work as antipyretics, which help to reduce fever, as well as being painkillers. You can't give them both at the same time, but if one doesn't work, you may want to try the other later. Antipyretics aren't always necessary. If your child isn't distressed by the fever or underlying illness, there's no need to use antipyretics to reduce a fever. When using antipyretics, always read the patient information leaflet that comes with the medication to find the correct dose and frequency for your child's age. Read more about treating a high temperature in children. More serious illnesses Sometimes a high temperature in children is associated with more serious signs and symptoms, such as: breathlessness vomiting  rash  fits or seizures  Possible serious bacterial illnesses include: meningitis \u2013 infection of the meninges, the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord septicaemia \u2013 infection of the blood pneumonia \u2013 inflammation of the lung tissue, usually caused by an infection It's important to remember that potentially serious causes of fever are relatively rare.

It's also known as \"female circumcision\" or \"cutting\", and by other terms such as sunna, gudniin, halalays, tahur, megrez and khitan, among others. FGM is usually carried out on young girls between infancy and the age of 15, most commonly before puberty starts. It is illegal in the UK and is child abuse. It's very painful and can seriously harm the health of women and girls. It can also cause long-term problems with sex, childbirth and mental health. Help and support is available if you've had FGM or you're worried that someone may be at risk. This page covers: Forms of FGM Effects of FGM Treatment for FGM (deinfibulation) Getting help and support Why it's carried out Where it's carried out The law and FGM Forms of FGM There are four main types of FGM: Type 1 (clitoridectomy) \u2013 removing part or all of the clitoris. Type 2 (excision) \u2013 removing part or all of the clitoris and the inner labia (lips that surround the vagina), with or without removal of the labia majora (larger outer lips). Type 3 (infibulation) \u2013 narrowing of the vaginal opening by creating a seal, formed by cutting and repositioning the labia. Other harmful procedures to the female genitals, including pricking, piercing, cutting, scraping or burning the area. FGM is often performed by traditional circumcisers or cutters who do not have any medical training. However, in some countries it may be done by a medical professional. Anaesthetics and antiseptics aren't generally used, and FGM is often carried out using knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razor blades. FGM often happens against a girl's will without her consent and girls may have to be forcibly restrained. Effects of FGM There are no health benefits to FGM and it can cause serious harm, including: constant pain pain and\/or difficulty having sex repeated infections, which can lead to infertility bleeding, cysts and abscesses problems passing urine or incontinence depression, flashbacks and self-harm  problems during labour and childbirth, which can be life-threatening for mother and baby Some girls die from blood loss or infection as a direct result of the procedure. FGM and sex FGM can make it difficult and painful to have sex. It can also result in reduced sexual desire and a lack of pleasurable sensation. Talk to your GP or another healthcare professional if you have sexual problems that you feel may be due to FGM, as they can refer you to a special therapist who can help. In some cases, a surgical procedure called a deinfibulation (see below) may be recommended, which can alleviate and improve some symptoms. FGM and pregnancy Some women with FGM may find it difficult to become pregnant, and those who do conceive can have problems in childbirth. If you're expecting a baby, your midwife should ask you at your antenatal appointment if you've had FGM. It's important to tell your midwife if you think this has happened to you, so they can arrange appropriate care for you and you baby. FGM and mental health FGM can be an extremely traumatic experience that can cause emotional difficulties throughout life, including; depression anxiety flashbacks to the time of the cutting nightmares and other sleep problems In some cases, women may not remember having the FGM at all, especially if it was performed when they were an infant. Talk to your GP or another healthcare professional if you're experiencing emotional or mental health problems that may be a result of FGM. Help and support is available. Treatment for FGM (deinfibulation) Surgery can be performed to open up the vagina, if necessary. This is called deinfibulation. It's sometimes known as a \"reversal\" although this name is misleading, as the procedure doesn\u2019t replace any removed tissue, and will not undo the damage caused. However, it can help many problems caused by FGM. Surgery may be recommended for: women who are unable to have sex or have difficulty passing urine  as a result of FGM pregnant women at risk of problems during labour or delivery as a result of FGM Deinfibulation should be carried out before getting pregnant, if possible. It can be done in pregnancy or labour if necessary, but ideally should be done before the last two months of pregnancy. The surgery involves making a cut (incision) to open the scar tissue over the entrance to the vagina. It's usually performed under local anaesthetic in a clinic and you won't normally need to stay overnight. A small number of women need either a general anaesthetic or spinal anaesthetic (injection in the back), which may involve a short stay in hospital. Getting help and support All women and girls have the right to control what happens to their bodies and the right to say no to FGM. Help is available if you've had FGM or you're worried that you or someone you know is at risk. If someone is in immediate danger, contact the police immediately by dialling 999. If you're concerned that someone may be at risk, contact the NSPCC helpline on 0800 028 3550 or fgmhelp@nspcc.org.uk. If you're under pressure to have FGM performed on your daughter, ask your GP, health visitor or other healthcare professional for help, or contact the NSPCC helpline. If you've had FGM, you can get help from a specialist NHS gynaecologist or FGM service \u2013 ask your GP, midwife or any other healthcare professional about services in your area. Download a list of NHS FGM clinics (PDF, 430kb). If you're a health professional caring for a patient under 18 who has undergone FGM, you have professional responsibilities to safeguard and protect her. Guidance and resources about FGM for healthcare staff are available on the GOV.UK website. Why FGM is carried out FGM is carried out for various cultural, religious and social reasons within families and communities in the mistaken belief that it will benefit the girl in some way (for example, as a preparation for marriage or to preserve her virginity). However, there are no acceptable reasons that justify FGM. It's a harmful practice that isn't required by any religion and there are no religious texts that say it should be done. There are no health benefits of FGM. FGM usually happens to girls whose mothers, grandmothers or extended female family members have had FGM themselves or if their father comes from a community where it's carried out. Where FGM is carried out Girls are sometimes taken abroad for FGM, but they may not be aware that this is the reason for their travel. Girls are more at risk of FGM being carried out during the summer holidays, as this allows more time for them to \"heal\" before they return to school. If you think there's a risk of this happening to you, you can download the Statement Opposing FGM and take it with you on holiday to show your family. Communities that perform FGM are found in many parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Girls who were born in the UK or are resident here but whose families originate from an FGM practising community are at greater risk of FGM happening to them. Communities at particular risk of FGM in the UK originate from: Egypt Eritrea Ethiopia Gambia Guinea Indonesia Ivory Coast Kenya Liberia Malaysia Mali Nigeria Sierra Leone Somalia Sudan Yemen The law and FGM FGM is illegal in the UK. It is an offence to: perform FGM (including taking a child abroad for FGM) help a girl perform FGM on herself in or outside the UK help anyone perform FGM in the UK help anyone perform FGM outside the UK on a UK national or resident fail to protect a girl for whom you are responsible from FGM Anyone who performs FGM can face up to 14 years in prison. Anyone found guilty of failing to protect a girl from FGM can face up to seven years in prison. Download the Statement Opposing FGM The summer holidays are when many young girls are taken abroad, often to their family's birth country, to have FGM performed. The FGM statement, also known as the FGM health passport, highlights the fact that FGM is a serious criminal offence in the UK. If you're worried about FGM, print out this statement, take it abroad with you and show it to your family. Keep the declaration in your passport, purse or bag, and carry it with you all the time. Download the 2015 FGM statement \u2013 English version (PDF, 218kb). There are also versions of the statement in other languages on the GOV.UK website. Leaflets to download The Department of Health has published leaflets for patients who want to know more about FGM. These are available in the following languages: More about FGM \u2013 English version (PDF, 248kb) Mwy o wybodaeth am FGM \u2013 Welsh version (PDF, 175kb) ስለ ኤፍ ጂ ኤም ተጨማሪ መረጃ \u2013 Amharic version (PDF, 1.09Mb) مزيد من المعلومات حول ختان الإناث \u2013 Arabic version (PDF, 177kb) FGM اطلاعات بیشتر درباره \u2013 Farsi version (PDF, 221kb) Renseignements complémentaires sur les MGF \u2013 French version (PDF, 182kb) FGM زانیاری زیاتر دەربارەی \u2013 Kurdish Sorani version (PDF, 246kb) Macluumaad dheeraad ah ee ku saabsan FGM \u2013 Somali version (PDF, 196kb) Habari zaidi kuhusu ukeketaji wa wanawake \u2013 Swahili version (PDF, 177kb) ብዛዕባ ኤፍ ጂ ኤም ተወሳኺ ሓበሬታ \u2013 Tigrinya version (PDF, 766kb) ایف جی ایم کے بارے میں مزید معلومات \u2013 Urdu version (PDF, 188kb) Page last reviewed: 16\/06\/2016 Next review due: 16\/06\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Although most lumps aren't breast cancer, any unusual changes to the breasts should be checked by a GP as soon as possible. If your GP finds a lump on examination, they will routinely refer you to be seen by a hospital specialist. There are several types of benign (non-cancerous) breast lump, most of which are harmless and are caused by hormonal changes that occur at different times in a woman's life, such as during the menstrual cycle. Common types of benign breast lump include: a fibroadenoma \u2013 a firm lump that moves around easily in the breast and is more common in younger women a breast cyst \u2013 a smooth, firm fluid-filled lump most commonly seen in women aged 30 to 60 a breast abscess \u2013 a painful collection of pus that forms under the skin of the breast, usually as the result of a bacterial infection Read more about the causes of breast lumps. Checking your breasts It's important to be \"breast aware\" so you can identify any problems in your breasts and get them checked out as soon as possible. This means being familiar with your breasts and what is normal for them, and examining them regularly for any changes. If you are 50 years or over, it's also important to attend breast cancer screening appointments every three years, where a type of X-ray called a mammogram will be carried out to look for early signs of cancer. But don't wait until your next screening appointment if you notice any problems in your breast. See your GP right away. Seeing your GP It is important you see your GP as soon as possible if you notice a lump in your breasts so a cause can be confirmed. Finding a lump in your breast can be a worry, but around 90% of breast lumps are benign. You also should see your GP if you notice any other changes to one or both of your breasts, such as: an area of thickened tissue nipple discharge, which may contain blood a change in the size or shape of your breasts dimpling on the skin of your breasts a rash on or around your nipples a change in your nipple's appearance \u2013 for example, becoming sunken into your breast persistent pain in your breasts or armpits a lump or swelling in your armpits Your GP will ask you about your symptoms and will then ask your permission to examine your breasts. You should also be asked whether you'd like another staff member \u2013 such as a practice nurse \u2013 to be present while your breast is being examined. Further tests Your GP may then refer you for further tests, such as an ultrasound scan and mammogram, to determine the cause. Being referred for further testing can be scary, but it does not necessarily mean your GP thinks you have breast cancer. Most people who have these further tests are eventually found to have a benign condition. Read more about diagnosing breast lumps. How breast lumps are treated Benign breast lumps do not necessarily require any treatment, although treatment may be recommended if the lump is particularly large, is getting bigger, or is causing other symptoms such as pain. Medication can often help relieve breast pain, and antibiotics can treat any bacterial infections that may have caused the lump to develop. In some cases, a needle may need to be used to drain away any fluid or pus within the breast lump. Local anaesthetic will be used to numb the area being treated so you don't feel any pain while this is carried out. Occasionally, surgery may be carried out to cut out the lump. This will normally be done under general anaesthetic (where you are asleep) and you will usually be able to go home the same day.

The growths are made up of muscle and fibrous tissue and vary in size. They're sometimes known as uterine myomas or leiomyomas. Many women are unaware they have fibroids because they don't have any symptoms. Women who do have symptoms (around one in three) may experience: heavy periods or painful periods tummy (abdominal) pain lower back pain a frequent need to urinate constipation pain or discomfort during sex In rare cases, further complications caused by fibroids can affect pregnancy or cause infertility. Seeing your GP As fibroids don't often cause symptoms, they're sometimes diagnosed by chance during a routine gynaecological examination, test or scan. However, see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of fibroids so they can investigate possible causes. If your GP thinks you may have fibroids, they'll usually refer you for an ultrasound scan to confirm the diagnosis. Read more about diagnosing fibroids. Why fibroids develop The exact cause of fibroids is unknown. However, they're linked to the hormone oestrogen. Oestrogen is the female reproductive hormone produced by the ovaries (the female reproductive organs). Fibroids usually develop during a woman's reproductive years (from around 16 to 50 years of age) when oestrogen levels are at their highest. They tend to shrink when oestrogen levels are low, such as after the menopause (when a woman's monthly periods stop). Who gets fibroids? Fibroids are common, with around 1 in 3 women developing them at some point in their life. They most often occur in women aged 30-50. Fibroids are thought to develop more frequently in women of African- Caribbean origin. It's also thought they occur more often in overweight or obese women because being overweight increases the level of oestrogen in the body. Women who've had children have a lower risk of developing fibroids, and the risk decreases further the more children you have. Types of fibroids Fibroids can grow anywhere in the womb and vary in size considerably. Some can be the size of a pea, whereas others can be the size of a melon. The main types of fibroids are: intramural fibroids \u2013 the most common type of fibroid, which develop in the muscle wall of the womb subserosal fibroids \u2013 fibroids that develop outside the wall of the womb into the pelvis and can become very large submucosal fibroids \u2013 fibroids that develop in the muscle layer beneath the womb's inner lining and grow into the cavity of the womb In some cases, subserosal or submucosal fibroids are attached to the womb with a narrow stalk of tissue. These are known as pedunculated fibroids. Treating fibroids Treatment for fibroids isn't needed if they aren't causing symptoms. Over time, fibroids will often shrink and disappear without treatment, particularly after the menopause. If you do have symptoms caused by fibroids, medication to help relieve the symptoms will usually be recommended first. There are also medications available to help shrink fibroids. If these prove ineffective, surgery or other less invasive procedures may be recommended. Read more about treating fibroids.

As well as widespread pain, people with fibromyalgia may also have: increased sensitivity to pain fatigue (extreme tiredness) muscle stiffness difficulty sleeping problems with mental processes (known as \"fibro-fog\") \u2013 such as problems with memory and concentration headaches irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \u2013 a digestive condition that causes stomach pain and bloating If you think you have fibromyalgia, visit your GP. Treatment is available to ease some of its symptoms, although they're unlikely to disappear completely. Read more about the symptoms of fibromyalgia. What causes fibromyalgia? The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but it's thought to be related to abnormal levels of certain chemicals in the brain and changes in the way the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord and nerves) processes pain messages carried around the body. It's also suggested that some people are more likely to develop fibromyalgia because of genes inherited from their parents. In many cases, the condition appears to be triggered by a physically or emotionally stressful event, such as: an injury or infection giving birth having an operation the breakdown of a relationship  the death of a loved one Read more about the causes of fibromyalgia. Who's affected? Anyone can develop fibromyalgia, although it affects around seven times as many women as men. The condition typically develops between the ages of 30 and 50, but can occur in people of any age, including children and the elderly. It's not clear exactly how many people are affected by fibromyalgia, although research has suggested it could be a relatively common condition. Some estimates suggest nearly 1 in 20 people may be affected by fibromyalgia to some degree. One of the main reasons it's not clear how many people are affected is because fibromyalgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose. There's no specific test for the condition, and the symptoms can be similar to a number of other conditions. Read more about diagnosing fibromyalgia. How fibromyalgia is treated Although there's currently no cure for fibromyalgia, there are treatments to help relieve some of the symptoms and make the condition easier to live with. Treatment tends to be a combination of: medication \u2013 such as antidepressants and painkillers talking therapies \u2013 such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and counselling lifestyle changes \u2013 such as exercise programmes and relaxation techniques Exercise in particular has been found to have a number of important benefits for people with fibromyalgia, including helping to reduce pain. Read more about:  treating fibromyalgia self-help for fibromyalgia Support groups Many people with fibromyalgia find that support groups provide an important network where they can talk to others living with the condition. Fibromyalgia Action UK is a charity that offers information and support to people with fibromyalgia. If you have any questions about fibromyalgia, call the charity's helpline on 0844 887 2444. The charity also has a network of local support groups you may find helpful and a online community, where you can find out about news, events and ongoing research into the condition.

It usually causes a bright red rash on the cheeks. Although the rash can look alarming, slapped cheek syndrome is normally a mild infection that clears up by itself in one to three weeks. Once you've had the infection, you're usually immune to it for life. However, slapped cheek syndrome can be more serious for some people. If you're pregnant, have a blood disorder or a weakened immune system and have been exposed to the virus, you should get medical advice. This page covers: Symptoms When to get medical advice What to do if you or your child has it How you get it Prevention Symptoms of slapped cheek syndrome Symptoms of slapped cheek syndrome usually develop 4-14 days after becoming infected, but sometimes may not appear for up to 21 days. Initial symptoms Some people with slapped cheek syndrome won't notice any early symptoms, but most people will have the following symptoms for a few days: a slightly high temperature (fever) of around 38C (100.4F) a runny nose  a sore throat a headache an upset stomach feeling generally unwell The infection is most contagious during this initial period. In adults, these symptoms are often accompanied by joint pain and stiffness, which may continue for several weeks or even months after the other symptoms have passed. Slapped cheek rash After a few days, a distinctive bright red rash on both cheeks (the so-called \"slapped cheeks\") normally appears, although adults may not get this. By the time this rash develops, the condition is no longer contagious. After another few days, a light pink rash may also appear on the chest, stomach, arms and thighs. This often has a raised, lace-like appearance and may be itchy. The rashes will normally fade within a week or two, although occasionally the body rash may come and go for a few weeks after the infection has passed. This can be triggered by exercise, heat, anxiety or stress. When to get medical advice You don't usually need to see your GP if you think you or your child has slapped cheek syndrome, as the condition normally gets better on its own. However, you should contact your GP, call NHS 111 or contact your local out-of-hours service if you have been exposed to anyone with slapped cheek or you have symptoms of the infection and: you're pregnant \u2013 infection in pregnancy, particularly early pregnancy, carries a risk of causing miscarriage, stillbirth or other complications; however, this risk is small and most pregnant women will already be immune (read more about the risks of slapped cheek syndrome in pregnancy) you have a blood disorder, such as sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia, or a weakened immune system \u2013 the infection can cause severe anaemia that may need to be treated in hospital you have symptoms of severe anaemia, such as very pale skin, severe shortness of breath, extreme tiredness or fainting In these cases, a blood test may be carried out to see if you're immune to the infection. If you're not immune, you'll be monitored carefully to check for any problems. If you develop severe anaemia, it's likely that you'll need to be admitted to hospital and have a blood transfusion to replace your damaged blood cells. What to do if you or your child has slapped cheek Slapped cheek syndrome is usually mild and should clear up without specific treatment. If you or your child is feeling unwell, you can try the following to ease the symptoms: rest and drink plenty of fluids \u2013 babies should continue their normal feeds for a fever, headaches or joint pain, you can take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen \u2013 children under 16 shouldn't take aspirin to reduce itchiness, you can take antihistamines or use an emollient (moisturising lotion) \u2013 some antihistamines are not suitable for young children, so check with your pharmacist first Unless you or your child is feeling unwell, there\u2019s no need to stay away from school or work once the rash has developed, as the infection is no longer contagious by this point. It's a good idea to notify your child's school about the infection, so children who develop early symptoms can be spotted quickly and vulnerable people can be made aware that they may need to get medical advice. How do you get slapped cheek syndrome? Slapped cheek syndrome is caused by a virus called parvovirus B19. This is found in the droplets in the coughs and sneezes of someone with the infection. The virus is spread in a similar way to colds and flu. You can become infected by:  inhaling droplets that are sneezed or coughed out by someone with the infection touching a contaminated surface or object and then touching your mouth or nose Someone with slapped cheek syndrome is infectious during the period before the rash develops. Once the rash appears, the condition can no longer be passed on. Preventing slapped cheek syndrome It's very difficult to prevent slapped cheek syndrome, because people who have the infection are most contagious before they develop any obvious symptoms. However, making sure that everyone in your household washes their hands frequently may help stop the infection from spreading. There's currently no vaccine available to protect you against the condition.

This page covers: Symptoms of a broken finger What to do if you've broken your finger Where to get medical help Treatments for a broken finger Aftercare for a broken finger Symptoms of a broken finger A broken finger may be: painful, swollen, and bruised stiff or difficult to move pointing in an unusual direction numb In some cases, the broken bone may poke through the skin (an open fracture) or you may see the bone through the wound. It can be hard to tell if a finger is broken, dislocated or badly sprained, as the symptoms tend to be similar. If you're not sure whether your finger is broken, it's a good idea to get medical advice. What to do if you've broken your finger You should get medical help if you think you've broken your finger \u2013 see below for information about where to go if you've broken your finger. While you're waiting for medical help: avoid moving the affected finger as much as possible \u2013 you could try gently securing it to the finger next to it, or to something like a pen or lollipop stick, using tape from a first aid kit as long as you're confident you know how to do it safely hold the affected hand above the level of your heart \u2013 this will help reduce any swelling gently hold ice wrapped in a cloth against the finger \u2013 this will also help reduce swelling and pain If it's an open fracture, cover the wound with a sterile dressing and secure it with a bandage. Apply pressure around the wound to control any bleeding. Where to get medical help If you think you've broken your finger, you should go to your nearest minor injuries unit, urgent care centre, or walk-in centre as soon as possible. Find your nearest minor injuries unit, urgent care centre or walk-in centre. You can also call NHS 111 for advice and information about the most appropriate local service to treat your injury. Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if there's no suitable alternative in your area, or you can see bone through the wound or sticking out of it (an open fracture). Treatments for a broken finger You'll be assessed by a trained practitioner, who will determine what tests and treatments are needed. An X-ray will usually be carried out to confirm whether your finger is broken, dislocated, or sprained. If it's fractured: the bone may need to be moved back into place \u2013 an injection of local anaesthetic is given to numb the area and a doctor then realigns the bone your finger will be put in a splint or plaster cast, or may be strapped to the finger next to it \u2013 this will hold the bone in position until it heals For open fractures, the wound will be cleaned surgically before the fracture is treated. You may also need a tetanus jab and antibiotics to help prevent infection. You'll be able to go home once the splint, cast, or strapping is in place. A follow-up appointment to check how your finger is healing may be arranged before you leave. Surgery may be required if the fracture is particularly severe and there has been damage to nearby nerves, tendons, or other tissue. The fracture may also need to be stabilised by fixing the bone with small wires or plates and screws. Aftercare for a broken finger A broken finger usually takes between two and eight weeks to heal, depending on which part of the finger is broken and how severe the break is. It may be a few months before full strength returns to the affected finger. While you're waiting for your follow-up appointment: try to avoid using the affected hand and disturbing the splint take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve any discomfort raise the affected hand above the level of your heart when you can to help reduce swelling \u2013 try resting it on a cushion while sitting and sleeping hold an ice pack, or something like a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a cloth, against the finger for about 10 minutes, three or four times a day \u2013 this can also help reduce any swelling The splint will be removed when the bone has healed. This will be after about two to three weeks for most people. Once the splint is taken off, keeping the finger moving as much as possible will help stop it becoming stiff. A physiotherapist may be able to advise you about some gentle hand exercises. Your doctor will be able to advise you about when you can return to contact sports or other activities that put a lot of strain on your fingers.

You won't be able to straighten the end of the finger because the tendon connecting the muscle to the finger bone is stretched or torn. The finger will also be painful and swollen. Sometimes a small fragment of bone breaks off with the tendon. Mallet finger is most often caused by a minor injury, such as catching the finger on clothing or bedding. It's also a common sports injury, particularly in sports where a ball or another object can strike the end of a finger. In some cases, mallet finger can be caused by a cut to the end of the finger on the side of the nail. What should I do? If you think you have mallet finger, go to your nearest minor injuries unit or accident and emergency (A&E) department to have it splinted. You should do this as soon as possible \u2013 the earlier it's treated, the better the outcome. Try to keep your hand raised until the doctor sees you. This helps to reduce any swelling and pain. Take off any rings on the affected finger, as swelling may make it difficult to remove them later or may cut off the blood supply to the finger. You can take an over-the-counter painkiller, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to relieve the pain. Once your finger is splinted, applying an ice pack a few times a day for 10 to 20 minutes may also help reduce pain and swelling. How is it treated? Your finger will be placed in a plastic splint, which keeps it straight, with the end joint slightly bent backwards. You'll still be able to bend the finger at the middle joint. Sometimes a custom splint is made by an occupational therapy team if a standard one doesn't fit well. The splint is taped on, and must be worn day and night for 6 to 12 weeks to allow the two ends of the torn tendon to stay together and heal. It should only be removed for cleaning. It's really important that the end of your finger doesn't bend during the time it's splinted, as this may slow down healing and reduce the effectiveness of the treatment. The middle joint of the finger is left free so you can continue to move it to prevent any stiffness developing. You should only need surgery if the finger bone has broken \u2013 known as a mallet fracture or bony mallet injury \u2013 or in the uncommon situation where the mallet finger fails to heal. How do I keep my finger and splint clean? The splinted finger must be kept clean and dry at all times. If the skin becomes wet inside the splint, it will become very sore. It's important to wash both your finger and the splint at least once a day, following these instructions: Keep your finger flat on the table, cut the strapping, and slide the splint off your finger. Wash and dry your finger and the splint using soap and water. Keep the end joint straight at all times by keeping your finger flat on the table. You may find it easier if someone helps you do this each day, as any movement of the end of the finger will delay the healing of the tendon, and may even cause permanent damage. Slide the splint back over the fingertip, still keeping the finger straight. Replace the strapping \u2013 this should cover the middle of the splint, but should not cover the middle joint of the finger. How long will it take to heal? Your mallet finger should heal within 6 to 12 weeks, after which time you'll be able to use the finger again. You may be advised to continue to only wear the splint at night for up to four more weeks. Sometimes you only need to see a specialist once, as a hand physiotherapist can take over your care. They'll provide you with exercises to perform at home to help prevent stiffness in the finger. Depending on your job, you may require time off work. It's important to avoid any sports involving the hands while your injury is healing. It may take several months to regain full function. Redness, swelling, and tenderness of the skin around the end of the finger are common for three or four months after injury, but usually settle eventually. Fractures involving the joint of the finger also increase the risk of arthritis in the future. You may be left with a small bump on the top of the joint and a slight loss of ability to straighten the joint \u2013 it never really goes completely back to normal. However, the finger should generally function well. Page last reviewed: 18\/03\/2015 Next review due: 18\/03\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Many deaths could be prevented if first aid is given before emergency services arrive. What to do If someone is injured you should: first check that you and the casualty aren't in any danger, and, if possible, make the situation safe if necessary, dial 999 or 112 for an ambulance when it's safe to do so carry out basic first aid Read more about what to do after an incident. If someone is unconscious and breathing If a person is unconscious but breathing, and has no other injuries that would stop them being moved, place them in the recovery position until help arrives. Keep them under observation to ensure they continue to breathe normally, and don't obstruct their airway. If someone is unconscious and not breathing If a person isn't breathing normally after an incident, call an ambulance and start CPR straight away. Use hands-only CPR if you aren't trained to perform rescue breaths. Read more about CPR, including instructions and a video about hands-only CPR. Common accidents and emergencies Below, in alphabetical order, are some of the most common injuries that need emergency treatment in the UK and information about how to deal with them: anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) bleeding burns and scalds   choking  drowning  electric shock (domestic)  fractures  heart attack  poisoning  shock  stroke Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) is a severe allergic reaction that can occur after an insect sting or after eating certain foods. The adverse reaction can be very fast, occurring within seconds or minutes of coming into contact with the substance the person is allergic to (allergen). During anaphylactic shock, it may be difficult for the person to breathe, as their tongue and throat may swell, obstructing their airway. Call 999 or 112 immediately if you think someone is experiencing anaphylactic shock. Check if the person is carrying any medication. Some people who know they have severe allergies may carry an adrenaline self-injector, which is a type of pre-loaded syringe. You can either help the person administer their medication or, if you're trained to do so, give it to them yourself. After the injection, continue to look after the person until medical help arrives. All casualties who have had an intramuscular or subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of adrenaline must be seen and medically checked by a healthcare professional as soon as possible after the injection has been given. Make sure they're comfortable and can breathe as best they can while waiting for medical help to arrive. If they're conscious, sitting upright is normally the best position for them. Read more about treating anaphylaxis. Bleeding If someone is bleeding heavily, the main aim is to prevent further blood loss and minimise the effects of shock (see below). First, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance as soon as possible. If you have disposable gloves, use them to reduce the risk of any infection being passed on. Check that there's nothing embedded in the wound. If there is, take care not to press down on the object. Instead, press firmly on either side of the object and build up padding around it before bandaging, to avoid putting pressure on the object itself. If nothing is embedded: apply and maintain pressure to the wound with your gloved hand, using a clean pad or dressing if possible; continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops  use a clean dressing to bandage the wound firmly if bleeding continues through the pad, apply pressure to the wound  until the bleeding stops and then apply another pad over the top and bandage it in place; don't remove the original pad or dressing, but continue to check that the bleeding has stopped  If a body part, such as a finger, has been severed, place it in a plastic bag or wrap it in cling film and make sure it goes with the casualty to hospital. Always seek medical help for bleeding unless it's minor. If someone has a nosebleed that hasn't stopped after 20 minutes, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Read more about how to treat minor bleeding from cuts and grazes and how to treat nosebleeds. Haemostatic dressings and tourniquets In certain situations, where bleeding is very severe and from the body\u2019s extremities, such as the head, neck and torso, it may be appropriate to use haemostatic dressings or a tourniquet. Haemostatic dressings contain properties that help the blood to clot (thicken) quicker. A tourniquet is a band that's wrapped tightly around a limb to stop blood loss. Haemostatic dressings and tourniquets should only be used by people who have been trained to apply them. Burns and scalds If someone has a burn or scald: cool the burn as quickly as possible with cool running water for at least 10 minutes, or until the pain is relieved call 999 or seek medical help, if needed while cooling the burn, carefully remove any clothing or jewellery, unless it's attached to the skin if you're cooling a large burnt area, particularly in babies, children and elderly people, be aware that it may cause hypothermia (it may be necessary to stop cooling the burn to avoid hypothermia)  cover the burn loosely with cling film; if cling film isn't available, use a clean, dry dressing or non-fluffy material; don't wrap the burn tightly, because swelling may lead to further injury don't apply creams, lotions or sprays to the burn For chemical burns, wear protective gloves, remove any affected clothing, and rinse the burn with cool running water for at least 20 minutes to wash out the chemical. If possible, determine the cause of the injury. In certain situations where a chemical is regularly handled, a specific chemical antidote may be available to use. Be careful not to contaminate and injure yourself with the chemical, and wear protective clothing if necessary. Call 999 or 112 for immediate medical help. Read more about how to treat burns and scalds. Choking The information below is for choking in adults and children over one year old. Read what to do if a baby under one year old is choking. Mild choking If the airway is only partly blocked, the person will usually be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe. In situations like this, a person will usually be able to clear the blockage themselves. If choking is mild: encourage the person to cough to try to clear the blockage ask them to try to spit out the object if it\u2019s in their mouth don't put your fingers in their mouth to help them because they may accidentally bite you If coughing doesn\u2019t work, start back blows (see below). Severe choking  If choking is severe, the person won\u2019t be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe, and without help they\u2019ll eventually become unconscious. To help an adult or child over one year old: Stand behind the person and slightly to one side. Support their chest with one hand. Lean the person forward so that the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down. Give up to five sharp blows between the person\u2019s shoulder blades with the heel of your hand (the heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist). Check if the blockage has cleared. If not, give up to five abdominal thrusts (see below). Abdominal thrusts shouldn't be used on babies under one year old, pregnant women or obese people. To perform abdominal thrusts on a person who is severely choking and isn\u2019t in one of the above groups: Stand behind the person who is choking. Place your arms around their waist and bend them well forward. Clench one fist and place it just above the person's belly button. Place your other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards. Repeat this up to five times. The aim is to get the obstruction out with each chest thrust, rather than necessarily doing all five. If the obstruction doesn't clear after three cycles of back blows and chest thrusts, dial 999 or 112 to ask for an ambulance, and continue until help arrives. The person choking should always be seen by a healthcare professional afterwards to check for any injuries or small pieces of the obstruction that remain. Drowning If someone is in difficulty in water, don't enter the water to help unless it's absolutely essential. Once the person is on land, if they're not breathing, open the airway and give five initial rescue breaths before starting CPR. If you're alone, perform CPR for one minute before calling for emergency help. Find out how to give CPR, including rescue breaths. If the person is unconscious but still breathing, put them into the recovery position with their head lower than their body and call an ambulance immediately. Continue to observe the casualty to ensure they don't stop breathing or that their airway becomes obstructed. Electric shock (domestic) If someone has had an electric shock, switch off the electrical current at the mains to break the contact between the person and the electrical supply. If you can't reach the mains supply: don't go near or touch the person until you're sure the electrical supply has been switched off   once the power supply has been switched off, and if the person isn't breathing, dial 999 or 112 to for an ambulance Afterwards, seek medical help - unless the electric shock is very minor. Fractures It can be difficult to tell if a person has a broken bone or a joint, as opposed to a simple muscular injury. If you're in any doubt, treat the injury as a broken bone. If the person is unconscious, has difficulty breathing or is bleeding severely, these must be dealt with first, by controlling the bleeding with direct pressure and performing CPR. If the person is conscious, prevent any further pain or damage by keeping the fracture as still as possible until you get them safely to hospital. Assess the injury and decide whether the best way to get them to hospital is by ambulance or car. For example, if the pain isn\u2019t too severe, you could transport them to hospital by car. It's always best to get someone else to drive, so that you can deal with the casualty if they deteriorate \u2013 for example, if they lose consciousness as a result of the pain or start to vomit. However, if: they\u2019re in a lot of pain and in need of strong painkilling medication, don't move them and call an ambulance it's obvious they have a broken leg, don't move them, but keep them in the position you found them in and call an ambulance you suspect they have injured or broken their back, don't move them and call an ambulance Don't give the casualty anything to eat or drink, because they may need an anaesthetic (numbing medication) when they reach hospital. You can read more about specific broken bones in the following pages:  broken ankle broken arm or wrist broken collarbone broken nose broken toe fractured ribs hip fracture Heart attack A heart attack is one of the most common life-threatening heart conditions in the UK. If you think a person is having, or has had, a heart attack, sit them down and make them as comfortable as possible, and call 999 or 112 for an ambulance. Symptoms of a heart attack include: chest pain \u2013 the pain is usually located in the centre or left side of the chest and can feel like a sensation of pressure, tightness or squeezing pain in other parts of the body \u2013 it can feel as if the pain is travelling from the chest down one or both arms, or into the jaw, neck, back or abdomen (tummy)  Sit the person down and make them comfortable. If they're conscious, reassure them and ask them to take a 300mg aspirin tablet to chew slowly (unless you know they shouldn't take aspirin \u2013 for example, if they're under 16 or allergic to it). If the person has any medication for angina, such as a spray or tablets, help them to take it. Monitor their vital signs, such as breathing, until help arrives. If the person deteriorates and becomes unconscious, open their airway, check their breathing and, if necessary, start CPR. Re-alert the emergency services that the casualty is now in cardiac arrest. Poisoning Poisoning is potentially life-threatening. Most cases of poisoning in the UK happen when a person has swallowed a toxic substance, such as bleach, taken an overdose of a prescription medication, or eaten wild plants and fungi. Alcohol poisoning can cause similar symptoms. If you think someone has swallowed a poisonous substance, call 999 or 112 to get immediate medical help and advice. The effects of poisoning depend on the substance swallowed, but can include vomiting, loss of consciousness, pain or a burning sensation. The following advice is important: Find out what's been swallowed, so you can tell the paramedic or doctor. Do not give the person anything to eat or drink unless a healthcare professional advises you to. Do not try to cause vomiting. Stay with the person, because their condition may get worse and they could become unconscious. If the person becomes unconscious while you're waiting for help to arrive, check for breathing and, if necessary, perform CPR. Don't perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if the casualty's mouth or airway is contaminated with the poison. Don't leave them if they're unconscious because they may roll onto their back, which could cause them to vomit. The vomit could then enter their lungs and make them choke. If the casualty is conscious and breathing normally, put them into the recovery position and continue to monitor their conscious state and breathing. Read more about treating someone who's been poisoned and treating alcohol poisoning. Shock In the case of a serious injury or illness, it's important to look out for signs of shock (see below). Shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the circulatory system fails to provide enough oxygenated blood to the body and, as a result, deprives the vital organs of oxygen. This is usually due to severe blood loss, but it can also occur after severe burns, severe vomiting, a heart attack, bacterial infection or a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). The type of shock described here isn't the same as the emotional response of feeling shocked, which can also occur after an accident. Signs of shock include: pale, cold, clammy skin sweating rapid, shallow breathing weakness and dizziness feeling sick and possibly vomiting thirst yawning sighing Seek medical help immediately if you notice that someone has any of the above signs of shock. If they do, you should: dial 999 or 112 as soon as possible and ask for an ambulance treat any obvious injuries lie the person down if their injuries allow you to and, if possible, raise and support their legs use a coat or blanket to keep them warm don't give them anything to eat or drink give them lots of comfort and reassurance monitor the person \u2013 if they stop breathing, start CPR and re-alert the emergency services Stroke The FAST guide is the most important thing to remember when dealing with people who have had a stroke. The earlier they receive treatment, the better. Call for emergency medical help straight away. If you think a person has had a stroke, use the FAST guide: Facial weakness \u2013 is the person unable to smile evenly, or are their eyes or mouth droopy? Arm weakness \u2013 is the person only able to raise one arm? Speech problems \u2013 is the person unable to speak clearly or understand you? Time to call 999 or 112 \u2013 for emergency help if a person has any of these symptoms Read more about the symptoms of a stroke. Getting help in an emergency In the UK, 999 has been the emergency services number for many years. However, you can now also call 112 to get help, which is the single emergency telephone number for the EU. This number will give you access to the emergency services wherever you are in the EU. When you call 999 or 112, you'll be asked what service you need, as well as: your telephone number the address you're calling from  a brief description of what's wrong with the casualty and whether they're bleeding, unconscious or not breathing The call handler may advise you on how to assist the casualty until help arrives.

To stay healthy or to improve health, adults need to do two types of physical activity each week: aerobic and strength exercises. How much physical activity you need to do each week depends on your age. Click on the links below for the recommendations for other age groups: early childhood (under 5 years old) young people (5 to 18 years old) older adults (65 and over)   Guidelines for adults aged 19-64 To stay healthy, adults aged 19-64 should try to be active daily and should do: at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity such as cycling or fast walking every week, and   strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms).   75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, such as running or a game of singles tennis every week, and strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms).  A mix of moderate and vigorous aerobic activity every week. For example, two 30-minute runs plus 30 minutes of fast walking equates to 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, and strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms).   A rule of thumb is that one minute of vigorous activity provides the same health benefits as two minutes of moderate activity.   One way to do your recommended 150 minutes of weekly physical activity is to do 30 minutes on 5 days a week.  All adults should also break up long periods of sitting with light activity. Find out why sitting is bad for your health. What counts as moderate aerobic activity? Examples of activities that require moderate effort for most people include: walking fast water aerobics riding a bike on level ground or with few hills doubles tennis pushing a lawn mower hiking skateboarding rollerblading volleyball basketball  Moderate activity will raise your heart rate and make you breathe faster and feel warmer. One way to tell if you're working at a moderate level is if you can still talk, but you can't sing the words to a song. Back to top What counts as vigorous activity? There is good evidence that vigorous activity can bring health benefits over and above that of moderate activity. Examples of activities that require vigorous effort for most people include: jogging or running swimming fast riding a bike fast or on hills singles tennis football rugby skipping rope hockey aerobics gymnastics martial arts Vigorous activity makes you breathe hard and fast. If you're working at this level, you won't be able to say more than a few words without pausing for breath. In general, 75 minutes of vigorous activity can give similar health benefits to 150 minutes of moderate activity. For a moderate to vigorous workout, try Couch to 5K, a nine-week running plan for beginners. Back to top What activities strengthen muscles? Muscle strength is necessary for: all daily movement to build and maintain strong bones to regulate blood sugar and blood pressure to help maintain a healthy weight Muscle-strengthening exercises are counted in repetitions and sets. A repetition is one complete movement of an activity, like a bicep curl or a sit-up. A set is a group of repetitions. For each strength exercise, try to do: at least one set eight to 12 repetitions in each set  To get health benefits from strength exercises, you should do them to the point where you struggle to complete another repetition. There are many ways you can strengthen your muscles, whether it's at home or in the gym. Examples of muscle-strengthening activities for most people include: lifting weights working with resistance bands doing exercises that use your own body weight, such as push-ups and sit-ups heavy gardening, such as digging and shovelling yoga Try Strength and Flex, a 5-week exercise plan for beginners to improve your strength and flexibility. You can do activities that strengthen your muscles on the same day or on different days as your aerobic activity - whatever's best for you. Muscle-strengthening exercises are not an aerobic activity, so you'll need to do them in addition to your 150 minutes of aerobic activity. Some vigorous activities count as both an aerobic activity and a muscle-strengthening activity. Examples include: circuit training aerobics running football rugby netball hockey Back to top Download a factsheet on physical activity guidelines for adults (19-64 years) (PDF, 568kb) For a summary on the health benefits of being more active, check out this Department of Health infographic (PDF, 500kb).

To stay healthy or to improve health, older adults need to do two types of physical activity each week: aerobic and strength exercises. The amount of physical activity you need to do each week depends on your age. Click on links below for the recommendations for other age groups: early childhood (under 5 years old) young people (5 to 18 years old) adults (19-64 years old)   Guidelines for older adults aged 65 and over Older adults aged 65 or older, who are generally fit and have no health conditions that limit their mobility, should try to be active daily and should do: at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity such as cycling or walking every week, and  strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms).          75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity such as running or a game of singles tennis every week, and strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms). a mix of moderate and vigorous aerobic activity every week. For example, two 30-minute runs, plus 30 minutes of fast walking, equates to 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, and strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms). A rule of thumb is that one minute of vigorous activity provides the same health benefits as two minutes of moderate activity.  You should also try to break up long periods of sitting with light activity, as sedentary behaviour is now considered an independent risk factor for ill health, no matter how much exercise you do. Find out why sitting is bad for your health.  Older adults at risk of falls, such as people with weak legs, poor balance and some medical conditions, should do exercises to improve balance and co-ordination on at least two days a week. Examples include yoga, tai chi and dancing. What counts as moderate aerobic activity? Examples of activities that require moderate effort for most people include: walking water aerobics ballroom and line dancing riding a bike on level ground or with few hills playing doubles tennis pushing a lawn mower canoeing volleyball  Moderate activity will raise your heart rate and make you breathe faster and feel warmer. One way to tell if you're exercising at a moderate level is if you can still talk, but you can't sing the words to a song. Daily chores such as shopping, cooking or housework don't count towards your 150 minutes, because the effort isn\u2019t enough to raise your heart rate, but they are important nonetheless, as they break up periods of sitting. Back to top What counts as vigorous aerobic activity? There is good evidence that vigorous activity can bring health benefits over and above that of moderate activity. Examples of activities that require vigorous effort for most people include: jogging or running aerobics swimming fast riding a bike fast or on hills singles tennis football hiking uphill energetic dancing martial arts Vigorous activity makes you breathe hard and fast. If you're working at this level, you won't be able to say more than a few words without pausing for breath. In general, 75 minutes of vigorous activity can give similar health benefits to 150 minutes of moderate activity. Back to top What activities strengthen muscles? Muscle strength is necessary for: all daily movement building and maintaining strong bones regulating blood sugar and blood pressure maintaining a healthy weight Muscle-strengthening exercises are counted in repetitions and sets. A repetition is one complete movement of an activity, like a bicep curl or a sit-up. A set is a group of repetitions. For each strength exercise, try to do: at least one set eight to 12 repetitions in each set To gain health benefits from strength exercises, you should do them to the point where you find it hard to complete another repetition. There are many ways you can strengthen your muscles, whether at home or in the gym. Examples of muscle-strengthening activities include: carrying or moving heavy loads, such as groceries activities that involve stepping and jumping, such as dancing heavy gardening, such as digging or shovelling exercises that use your body weight for resistance, such as push-ups or sit-ups yoga lifting weights Try Strength and Flex, a 5-week exercise plan for beginners, to improve your strength and flexibility. You can do activities that strengthen your muscles on the same day or on different days as your aerobic activity \u2013 whatever's best for you. Muscle-strengthening exercises are not an aerobic activity, so you'll need to do them in addition to your 150 minutes of aerobic activity. Some vigorous activities count as both an aerobic activity and a muscle-strengthening activity. Examples include: circuit training aerobics running football rugby netball hockey Back to top Download a factsheet on physical activity guidelines for older adults (65+ years) (PDF, 462kb) For a summary on the health benefits of being more active, check out this Department of Health infographic (PDF, 500kb).

Being physically active every day is important for the healthy growth and development of babies, toddlers and preschoolers. For this age group, activity of any intensity should be encouraged, including light activity and more energetic physical activity. The amount of physical activity you need to do each week is determined by your age. Click on the links below for the recommendations for other age groups: young people (5 to 18 years old) adults (19 to 64 years old) older adults (65 and over)   Babies Babies should be encouraged to be active throughout the day, every day. Before your baby begins to crawl, encourage them to be physically active by reaching and grasping, pulling and pushing, moving their head, body and limbs during daily routines, and during supervised floor play, including tummy time. Once babies can move around, encourage them to be as active as possible in a safe, supervised and nurturing play environment.  For more ideas, see Keeping kids active. Toddlers Children who can walk on their own should be physically active every day for at least 180 minutes (three hours). This should be spread throughout the day, indoors or outside. The 180 minutes can include light activity such as standing up, moving around, rolling and playing, as well as more energetic activity like skipping, hopping, running and jumping. Active play, such as using a climbing frame, riding a bike, playing in water, chasing games and ball games, is the best way for this age group to get moving. All children aged under five Children under five should not be inactive for long periods, except when they're asleep. Watching TV, travelling by car, bus or train, or being strapped into a buggy for long periods are not good for a child's health and development. There's growing evidence that such behaviour can increase their risk of poor health.  Find out why being sedentary is bad for your health.  All children under five who are overweight can improve their health by meeting the activity guidelines, even if their weight doesn't change. To achieve and maintain a healthy weight, they may need to do additional activity and make dietary changes. What counts as light activity for children? Light activity for children includes a range of activities, such as: standing up moving around walking less energetic play Back to top What counts as energetic activity for children? Examples of energetic activities suitable for most children who can walk on their own include: active play (such as hide and seek and stuck in the mud) running around jumping on a trampoline riding a bike dancing swimming climbing skipping rope gymnastics Energetic activity for children will make kids \"huff and puff\" and can include organised activities, such as dance and gymnastics. Any sort of active play will usually include bursts of energetic activity.

The arch, or instep, is the middle part of the foot that's usually raised off the ground when you stand, while the rest of the foot remains flat on the ground. In young children, this arch isn't always visible because of the baby fat and soft tissue in their feet. It usually develops and appears as they get older. However, some people never really develop this arch. Sometimes, this is because they inherited flat feet from their parents. Are flat feet a problem? Flat feet are usually nothing to worry about. Many people with flat feet don't have any associated problems, so treatment isn't necessary.  However, flat feet can sometimes be associated with: pain in the feet, ankles, lower legs, knees, hips or lower back the feet rolling inwards too much (overpronation) \u2013 this can cause shoes to wear out quickly and lead to injuries an underlying problem with the bones, muscles or connective tissues in and around the feet (see below) Treatment may be recommended if you have any of these problems. When to seek medical advice Consider seeing your GP if you have flat feet and your: feet are painful, even when wearing supportive, well-fitting shoes shoes wear out very quickly feet appear to be getting flatter feet are weak, numb or stiff Your GP will examine your foot and may be able to advise you about treatments that can help. If necessary, they may be able to refer you to a podiatrist (a specialist in foot problems) or orthopaedic surgeon on the NHS to discuss possible treatments. You can also contact a podiatrist or orthopaedic surgeon directly if you're considering private treatment. Find a podiatrist near you or find a doctor on the British Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (BOFAS) website.  What causes flat feet? Many people simply inherit flat feet from their parents. Occasionally, flat feet can be the result of: the feet bones not forming properly in the womb loose connective tissue throughout the body, such as in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or joint hypermobility syndrome a condition affecting the muscles and nerves, such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida or muscular dystrophy the connective tissue in the foot becoming stretched and inflamed \u2013 possibly as a result of overuse, unsupportive footwear, an injury, increasing age, obesity or rheumatoid arthritis Treatments for flat feet Flat feet only need to be treated if you have an associated problem, such as pain, overpronation or an underlying health condition. Non-surgical treatments are often recommended first, although surgery may be needed in some cases. Non-surgical treatments Your GP or podiatrist may recommend: wearing supportive shoes that fit well wearing specially made insoles (orthotics) inside your shoes to support your feet and stop them rolling inwards taking painkillers if you have any discomfort losing weight if you're overweight stretching the muscles and connective tissues in your lower legs to help stop your foot rolling over \u2013 you may be referred to a physiotherapist, who can recommend some exercises to try These treatments won't change the shape of the feet, but may help relieve some of the problems associated with flat feet.  If these measures don't help, you may be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon to discuss whether surgery is an option. Surgery Surgery is normally only considered if the treatments above haven't helped or you have an underlying problem that can be corrected with an operation, such as abnormally developed bones in the feet. The surgical procedure recommended for you will depend on the cause of your flat feet. For example, bones that are abnormally shaped or joined together may need to be straightened or separated, while flat feet caused by a problem with your connective tissues may be treated by lengthening or repairing the affected tissues. Your surgeon will talk to you about the operation you may need and what this involves.

This is known as \"flat head syndrome\", and there are two main types: plagiocephaly \u2013 the head is flattened on one side, causing it to look asymmetrical; the ears may be misaligned and the head looks like a parallelogram when seen from above, and sometimes the forehead and face may bulge a little on the flat side brachycephaly \u2013 the back of the head becomes flattened, causing the head to widen, and occasionally the forehead bulges out These problems are quite common, affecting around one in every five babies at some point. In most cases they aren't a major cause for concern, as they don't have any effect on the brain and the head shape will often improve by itself over time. Your baby won't experience any pain or other symptoms, or any problems with their general development. This page covers: What causes plagiocephaly and brachycephaly When to get medical advice What you can do Helmets, headbands and mattresses Will my child's head shape return to normal? What causes plagiocephaly and brachycephaly? The skull consists of plates of bone that strengthen and join together as a child gets older. A young baby's skull is still relatively soft and can change shape if there's constant pressure on a particular part of their head. Reasons why this may happen include: sleeping on their back \u2013 the back or side of a baby's head can become flattened as a result of always sleeping on their back, but it's important they do this to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) problems in the womb \u2013 pressure can be placed on a baby's head before it's born if things are a bit squashed in the womb or there's a lack of amniotic fluid to cushion the baby being born prematurely \u2013 premature babies are more likely to develop a flattened head because their skull is softer when they're born and they may prefer to rest their head on one side at first because they're not yet able to move their head themselves neck muscle tightness \u2013 this can prevent a baby turning their head a particular way, meaning one side of their head is placed under more pressure Occasionally, a flattened head can be caused by the plates of the skull joining together too early. This is known as craniosynostosis. When to get medical advice Speak to your health visitor or GP if you're concerned about the shape of your baby's head or think they may have problems turning their head. They can examine your baby's head and suggest things you can do to help. A slightly flattened head isn't usually anything to worry about, but it's a good idea to get advice early on so you can take steps to stop it getting any worse. What you can do The shape of your baby's head should improve naturally over time as their skull develops and they start moving their head, rolling around, and crawling. Simple measures to take pressure off the flattened part of their head can also help: give your baby time on their tummy during the day \u2013 encourage them to try new positions during play time, but make sure they always sleep on their back as this is safest for them switch your baby between a sloping chair, a sling and a flat surface \u2013 this ensures there isn't constant pressure on one part of their head change the position of toys and mobiles in their cot \u2013 this will encourage your baby to turn their head on to the non-flattened side alternate the side you hold your baby when feeding and carrying reduce the time your baby spends lying on a firm flat surface, such as car seats and prams \u2013 try using a sling or front carrier when practical If your baby has difficulty turning their head, physiotherapy may help loosen and strengthen their neck muscles. Corrective surgery may be needed if they have craniosynostosis. Read more about treating craniosynostosis. Helmets, headbands and mattresses There are specially designed helmets and headbands that some people claim can help improve the shape of a baby's skull as they grow. These devices apply pressure to \"bulging\" parts of the skull and relieve pressure from other parts, potentially allowing growth in the flatter areas. Treatment is started when the child's skull is still soft, usually at around five or six months old, and the device is worn almost continuously (up to 23 hours a day) for several months. However, these helmets and headbands generally aren't recommended because: there isn't clear evidence to suggest they work they often cause problems such as skin irritation and rashes they're expensive, typically costing around £2,000 your baby will need to be checked every few weeks to monitor their head growth and make any necessary adjustments they may be uncomfortable and distressing for your baby Some people try special curved mattresses that are designed to distribute the weight of a baby's head over a larger area so less pressure is placed on a particular point of their skull. These are cheaper than helmets and headbands, but there's currently only limited evidence to suggest they may help. Will my child's head shape return to normal? Mild flattening of the head will usually improve if you use the simple measures outlined above, although it may be a couple of months before you start to notice an improvement. Your baby's head may not return to a completely perfect shape, but by the time they're one or two years old any flattening will be barely noticeable. More severe cases will also get better over time, although some flattening will usually remain. As your child becomes more mobile and their hair grows, the appearance of their head should improve. It's very rare for a child to experience problems such as teasing when they reach school age. You may consider using a helmet or headband if you're worried about your child, but it's not clear whether these always work. You should also bear in mind the inconvenience, expense, and possible discomfort for you and your child.

It's more commonly known as \"passing wind\", or \"farting\". Farting is often laughed about, but excessive flatulence can be embarrassing and make you feel uncomfortable around others. However, it can usually be controlled with changes to your diet and lifestyle. Flatulence is a normal biological process and is something everyone experiences regularly. Some people pass wind only a few times a day, others a lot more, but the average is said to be about 5 to 15 times a day. Why it happens When you swallow food, water or saliva, you also swallow small amounts of air, which collects in the digestive system. Gases can also build up when you digest food. The body needs to get rid of the build-up by farting (flatulence) or burping (belching). Sometimes you may not notice you have passed wind because most of the gases are odourless and often released in small quantities. Flatulence usually only has a bad smell if it contains gases that smell, such as sulphur. However, it's important to remember it's normal for the gas you pass to sometimes smell a bit. Excessive flatulence can be caused by swallowing more air than usual or eating food that's difficult to digest. It can also be related to an underlying health problem affecting the digestive system, such as recurring indigestion or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Read more about the causes of flatulence. When to see your GP There are no medical guidelines defining the normal frequency or volume of flatulence. You're probably the best person to assess your own symptoms. See your GP if your flatulence is particularly troublesome \u2013 for example, if you're frequently passing smelly gas. You should also visit your GP if you experience additional symptoms, such as: persistent abdominal pain and bloating recurring episodes of diarrhoea or constipation unexplained weight loss bowel incontinence  blood in your stools (faeces) signs of an infection, such as a high temperature, vomiting, chills, joint pain and muscle pain These symptoms could be an indicator of a more serious health problem and may require investigation, such as a blood or stool test to look for an infection. Controlling the problem Excessive flatulence can usually be controlled by making changes to your diet and lifestyle, such as: avoiding foods known to cause flatulence eating smaller and more frequent meals eating and drinking slowly exercising regularly There are also some over-the-counter medications that can help if your flatulence is troublesome, such as charcoal tablets or simethicone. If your flatulence is related to an underlying health problem, treating the condition may help resolve it. Read more about treating flatulence.

But occasionally they can become infected, cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or spread serious illnesses such as Lyme disease and malaria. Bugs that bite or sting include wasps, hornets, bees, horseflies, ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, spiders and midges. This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you've been bitten or stung When to get medical advice When to get emergency medical help Prevention Symptoms of insect bites and stings Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Some people have a mild allergic reaction and a larger area of skin around the bite or sting becomes swollen, red and painful. This should pass within a week. Occasionally, a severe allergic reaction can occur, causing symptoms such as breathing difficulties, dizziness and a swollen face or mouth. This requires immediate medical treatment (see below). Read more about the symptoms of common insect bites and stings. What to do if you've been bitten or stung To treat an insect bite or sting: Remove the sting or tick if it's still in the skin (see treating insect bites and stings for advice about how to do this safely). Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they're unlikely to help. The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. Ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments that can help, such as painkillers, creams for itching and antihistamines. Read more about treatments for insect bites and stings. When to get medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if: you're worried about a bite or sting your symptoms don't start to improve within a few days or are getting worse you've been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes a large area (around 10cm or more) around the bite becomes red and swollen you have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness you have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a fever, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms When to get emergency medical help Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe reaction, such as: wheezing or difficulty breathing a swollen face, mouth or throat nausea or vomiting a fast heart rate dizziness or feeling faint difficulty swallowing loss of consciousness Emergency treatment in hospital is needed in these cases. Prevent insect bites and stings There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin \u2013 repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants \u2013 these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. You may need to take extra precautions if you're travelling to part of the world where there's a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about how to prevent insect bites and stings.

They can be different shapes and sizes and may look like: tiny black dots   small, shadowy dots   larger cloud-like spots  long, narrow strands You may have many small floaters in your field of vision or just one or two larger ones. Most floaters are small and quickly move out of your field of vision. Floaters are often most noticeable when you're looking at a light-coloured background, such as a white wall or clear sky. Do floaters affect vision? Floaters sometimes occur without a person noticing them. This is because the brain constantly adapts to changes in vision and learns to ignore floaters so they don't affect vision. Floaters are usually harmless and don't significantly affect your vision. However, it's important you have your eyes checked by an optician regularly (at least once every two years). Larger floaters can be distracting and may make activities involving high levels of concentration, such as reading or driving, difficult. Find an optician near you. What causes floaters? Floaters are small pieces of debris that float in the eye's vitreous humour. Vitreous humour is a clear, jelly-like substance that fills the space in the middle of the eyeball. The debris casts shadows on to the retina (the light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye). If you have floaters, it's these shadows you'll see. Floaters can occur as your eyes change with age. In most cases, they don't cause significant problems and don't require treatment. In rare cases, floaters may be a sign of a retinal tear or retinal detachment (where the retina starts to pull away from the blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients). Read more about the causes of floaters. Floaters can't be prevented because they're part of the natural ageing process. When to seek medical help Visit your optician immediately if you notice an increase or sudden change in your floaters, particularly if you notice white flashes and some loss of vision. Your optician may refer you to an ophthalmologist (a specialist in diagnosing and treating eye conditions) who can check your retina for tears or retinal detachment. Even though floaters are usually harmless and don't significantly affect your vision, it's important you have your eyes checked regularly by an optician (at least once every two years). Read more about diagnosing floaters. Treating floaters In most cases, floaters don't cause major problems and don't require treatment. Eye drops or similar types of medication won't make floaters disappear. After a while, your brain learns to ignore floaters and you may not notice them. If your floaters don't improve over time, or if they significantly affect your vision, a vitrectomy may be recommended. This is a surgical operation to remove the vitreous humour in your eye along with any floating debris and replace it with a saline (salty) solution. If your retina has become detached, surgery is the only way to re-attach it. Without surgery, a total loss of vision is almost certain. In 90% of cases, only one operation is needed to re-attach the retina. Read more about treating floaters. JavaScript and the Flash Player are required to view NHS Choices tools.

It can be very unpleasant, but you'll usually begin to feel better within about a week. You can catch flu \u2013 short for influenza \u2013 all year round, but it's especially common in winter, which is why it's also known as \"seasonal flu\". It's not the same as the common cold. Flu is caused by a different group of viruses and the symptoms tend to start more suddenly, be more severe and last longer. Some of the main symptoms of flu include: a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above tiredness and weakness a headache general aches and pains a dry, chesty cough Cold-like symptoms \u2013 such as a blocked or runny nose, sneezing, and a sore throat \u2013 can also be caused by flu, but they tend to be less severe than the other symptoms you have. Flu can make you feel so exhausted and unwell that you have to stay in bed and rest until you feel better. Read more about the symptoms of flu. What to do If you're otherwise fit and healthy, there's usually no need to see a doctor if you have flu-like symptoms. The best remedy is to rest at home, keep warm and drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. You can take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower a high temperature and relieve aches if necessary. Stay off work or school until you're feeling better. For most people, this will take about a week. Read more about treating flu at home. When to see your GP Consider visiting your GP if: you're 65 years of age or over you're pregnant you have a long-term medical condition \u2013 such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease or a neurological disease you have a weakened immune system \u2013 for example, because you're having chemotherapy or have HIV you develop chest pain, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or start coughing up blood your symptoms are getting worse over time or haven't improved after a week In these situations, you may need medication to treat or prevent complications of flu. Your doctor may recommend taking antiviral medicine to reduce your symptoms and help you recover more quickly. Read more about antiviral medication for flu. How long does flu last and is it serious? If you have flu, you generally start to feel ill within a few days of being infected. You should begin to feel much better within a week or so, although you may feel tired for much longer. You will usually be most infectious from the day your symptoms start and for a further three to seven days. Children and people with weaker immune systems may remain infectious for longer. Most people will make a full recovery and won't experience any further problems, but elderly people and people with certain long-term medical conditions are more likely to have a bad case of flu or develop a serious complication, such as a chest infection. Read more about the complications of flu. How you catch flu The flu virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when someone who is infected coughs or sneezes. These droplets typically spread about one metre. They hang suspended in the air for a while before landing on surfaces, where the virus can survive for up to 24 hours. Anyone who breathes in the droplets can catch flu. You can also catch the virus by touching the surfaces that the droplets have landed on if you pick up the virus on your hands and then touch your nose or mouth. Everyday items at home and in public places can easily become contaminated with the flu virus, including food, door handles, remote controls, handrails, telephone handsets and computer keyboards. Therefore, it's important to wash your hands frequently. You can catch flu many times, because flu viruses change regularly and your body won't have natural resistance to the new versions. Preventing the spread of flu You can help stop yourself catching flu or spreading it to others with good hygiene measures. Always wash your hands regularly with soap and warm water, as well as: regularly cleaning surfaces such as your computer keyboard, telephone and door handles to get rid of germs using tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze putting used tissues in a bin as soon as possible You can also help stop the spread of flu by avoiding unnecessary contact with other people while you're infectious. You should stay off work or school until you're feeling better. In some people at risk of more serious flu, an annual flu vaccine (see below) or antiviral medication may be recommended to help reduce the risk of becoming infected. Read more about how to stop the spread of flu. The flu vaccine A flu vaccine is available for free on the NHS for: anyone over the age of 65  pregnant women anyone who is very overweight (with a body mass index over 40) children and adults with an underlying health condition (particularly long-term heart or lung disease) children and adults with weakened immune systems An annual flu vaccine nasal spray is also now offered to healthy children aged two, three and four years old, and to children in school years one and two.  The best time to have the vaccine is in the autumn, between September and early November. If you think you might need it, contact your local GP surgery. You should have the flu vaccination every year so you stay protected, as the viruses that cause flu change every year. For more information on who should have the flu vaccine and how to get it, read the sections on the flu jab for adults, the flu jab for pregnant women and the children's flu vaccine. Other types of flu As well as seasonal flu, there are several other types of flu. These include: bird (avian) flu \u2013 a type of flu spread among birds that affects humans in rare cases swine flu \u2013 the type of flu that was responsible for the flu pandemic in 2009-10 \"gastric flu\" (gastroenteritis) \u2013 an infection of the digestive system, which can be caused by bacteria or viruses such as the norovirus Click on the links above for more information about these types of flu.

In rare cases, it can affect humans. There are many different strains of bird flu virus, most of which don't infect humans. However, two particular strains have caused serious concern in recent years: H5N1 (since 1997) H7N9 (since 2013) Although these viruses don't infect people easily and aren't usually transmitted from human to human, several people have been infected around the world, leading to a number of deaths. Other bird flu viruses \u2013 particularly H7N7 and H9N2, and more recently H6N1, H10N8 and H5N6 \u2013 have also infected people, but these have been very rare or only rarely caused severe illness. Bird flu affects many species of birds, including chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese. It can be passed between commercial, wild and pet birds. Birds don't always get sick from infection, so seemingly healthy birds may still pose a risk to people who come into contact with them. Bird flu in the UK No humans have been infected with bird flu in the UK, although plans are in place to manage any suspected cases. A few cases of bird flu were confirmed in poultry in the UK recently. In February 2015, a low-severity H7N7 strain of bird flu was confirmed at a farm in Hampshire, but restrictions around the premises were lifted 21 days later after cleaning and disinfection. Before that, in November 2014, H5N8 bird flu was confirmed at a duck breeding farm in Yorkshire, but the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the risk to public health was very low. This is because H5N8 infection was not found in humans during the recent worldwide epidemic among birds. The last reported case of H5N1 in the UK was in early 2008. You can read reports on recent cases of bird flu in the UK on the GOV.UK website. Signs and symptoms Like other types of flu, bird flu symptoms often include: a high temperature (fever) aching muscles headache respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose Diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal (tummy) pain, chest pain, and bleeding from the nose and gums have also been reported as early symptoms in some people. These symptoms can come on suddenly. The time from infection to the start of symptoms (incubation period) is usually three to five days, although in some cases it can be up to seven days. Within days of symptoms appearing, potentially fatal complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure may develop. Prompt treatment with antiviral medication may help prevent complications and reduce the risk of death. Treatment People with suspected symptoms of bird flu (avian flu) will be advised to stay at home, or will be cared for in hospital in isolation from other patients. The main recommendations are: resting drinking plenty of fluids and eating healthily taking medication to help treat fever and pain, such as aspirin and paracetamol Antiviral medication In the UK, certain antiviral medications have been stockpiled for use in the event of an outbreak. These medications work by stopping the virus multiplying in your body. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Zanamivir (Relenza) and Peramivir (Rapivab) help reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival. For regular flu, these medications are most effective if given within 48 hours of symptoms developing, but it's not clear if this is the case for bird flu. Nevertheless, they should be given as soon as possible to people suspected or proven to be infected, even if it's more than 48 hours after symptoms started. These medications may also be given as a preventative measure to people who could have been exposed to bird flu viruses \u2013 for example, other household members, healthcare workers, or people who have had close contact with infected birds. In these cases, the course of medication should begin as soon as possible after exposure to the virus and continue for 7 to 10 days after the last known exposure. Treating complications Complications such as bacterial pneumonia may develop in some people and can be treated with regular antibiotics. People who are severely affected may need to be given extra oxygen to help them breathe \u2013 for example, through a ventilator (a machine that assists with breathing). When to seek medical advice You should contact your GP or call NHS 111 immediately if you experience these symptoms and you've visited an area affected by bird flu in the last two weeks. An initial assessment can be made over the phone, at a GP surgery, at home, or in a side room at a hospital. Bird flu is diagnosed based on your symptoms and the likelihood that you've been exposed to an infected bird. The doctor will ask you whether you've: recently travelled to an area affected by bird flu and if you've been close (within one metre) to live or dead domestic fowl or wild birds, including those at bird markets had close contact (touching or speaking distance) with anyone who has a severe respiratory illness had contact with anyone who died unexpectedly and who was from an area that had an outbreak If bird flu is suspected, the following tests will be carried out to establish whether you have the infection: chest X-ray virus detection using a nose and throat swab blood tests If the laboratory tests and chest X-ray results are normal, it's unlikely you have bird flu. You can read about outbreaks of bird flu in the UK on the GOV.UK website. How bird flu spreads to humans Bird flu is spread through direct contact with infected birds (dead or alive), an infected bird's droppings, or secretions from their eyes or respiratory tract. Close and prolonged contact with an infected bird is generally required for the infection to spread to humans. For example: touching infected birds that are dead or alive inhaling or being in contact with dried dust from the droppings or bedding of infected birds inhaling or being in contact with droplets sneezed by infected birds culling, slaughtering, butchering or preparing infected poultry for cooking Another possible source of bird flu can be live markets, where birds are sold in crowded and sometimes unsanitary conditions. Avoid visiting these markets if you're travelling in countries that have had an outbreak of bird flu. Bird flu isn't transmitted through cooked food. Poultry and eggs are safe to eat in areas that have experienced outbreaks of bird flu. Preventing bird flu There are a number of things you can do to reduce your risk when you visit areas where outbreaks have been reported, such as: avoid visiting live animal markets and poultry farms avoid contact with surfaces that are contaminated with bird droppings don't pick up or touch birds (dead or alive) don't eat or handle undercooked or raw poultry, egg or duck dishes don't bring any live poultry products back to the UK, including feathers always practise good personal hygiene, such as washing your hands regularly There are no restrictions on travel to countries that have been or are currently affected by bird flu. Read more about preventing bird flu. Reporting suspected cases of bird flu Bird flu is a notifiable disease in animals and you should report any suspected case to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), even if you're not sure. Call the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) helpline on 08459 33 55 77 if you find five or more dead birds in the same place. Read about notifiable diseases in animals on the GOV.UK website. Human cases The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that by May 2015, 840 people had been infected with the H5N1 virus worldwide and 447 had died. Indonesia, Egypt and Vietnam experienced most cases and fatalities. Since March 2013, there have been reports of people being infected with the H7N9 virus, mostly in the southeastern part of mainland China. By May 2015, there had been 665 confirmed cases and 229 deaths. Most cases were among middle-aged to elderly men. A small number of cases were reported in travellers from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and Canada. For both viruses, there have been some reports of limited human to human transmission, usually as a result of very close contact between family members. People who have had bird flu generally developed the virus after coming into close and prolonged contact with infected birds. Millions of birds have been killed during outbreaks to prevent the disease spreading and being passed on to people.

Where to get the flu jab You can have your NHS flu jab at: your GP surgery a local pharmacy offering the service your midwifery service if they offer it for pregnant women Some community pharmacies now offer flu vaccination to adults (but not children) at risk of flu including pregnant women, people aged 65 and over, people with long-term health conditions and carers. If you have your flu jab at a pharmacy, you don't have to inform your GP \u2013 it is up to the pharmacist to do that. How effective is the flu jab? Flu vaccine is the best protection we have against an unpredictable virus that can cause unpleasant illness in children and severe illness and death among at-risk groups, including older people, pregnant women and those with an underlying medical health condition. Studies have shown that the flu jab does work and will help prevent you getting the flu. It won't stop all flu viruses and the level of protection may vary between people, so it's not a 100% guarantee that you'll be flu-free, but if you do get flu after vaccination it's likely to be milder and shorter-lived than it would otherwise have been. There is also evidence to suggest that the flu jab can reduce your risk of having a stroke. Over time, protection from the injected flu vaccine gradually decreases and flu strains often change. So new flu vaccines are produced each year which is why people advised to have the flu jab need it every year too. Read more about how the flu jab works. Flu jab side effects Serious side effects of the injected flu vaccine are very rare. You may have a slight temperature and aching muscles for a couple of days after having the jab, and your arm may be a bit sore where you were injected. Read more about the side effects of the flu jab. When to have a flu jab The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn, from the beginning of October to early November, but don't worry if you've missed it, you can have the vaccine later in winter. Ask your GP or pharmacist. The flu jab for 2016\/17 Each year, the viruses that are most likely to cause flu are identified in advance and vaccines are made to match them as closely as possible. The vaccines are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Most injected flu vaccines protect against three types of flu virus: A\/H1N1 \u2013 the strain of flu that caused the swine flu pandemic in 2009 A\/H3N2 \u2013 a strain of flu that mainly affects the elderly and people with risk factors like a long term health condition. In 2016\/17 the vaccine will contain an A\/Hong Kong\/4801\/2014 H3N2-like virus Influenza B - a strain of flu that particularly affects children. In 2016\/17 the vaccine will contain B\/Brisbane\/60\/2008-like virus The nasal spray flu vaccine and some injected vaccines also offer protection against a fourth B strain of virus, which in 2016\/17 is the B\/Phuket\/3073\/2013-like virus. Is there anyone who shouldn't have the flu jab? Most adults can have the injected flu vaccine, but you should avoid it if you have had a serious allergic reaction to a flu jab in the past. Read more about who shouldn't have the flu vaccine. You can find out more by reading the answers to the most common questions that people have about the flu vaccine.

It was responsible for the flu pandemic in 2009-10. The virus is officially known as influenza virus A\/H1N1pdm09. The swine flu pandemic The virus was first identified in Mexico in April 2009 and was also known as Mexican flu. It became known as swine flu because the virus closely resembled known influenza viruses that cause illness in pigs. It spread rapidly from country to country because it was a new type of flu virus that few people were immune to. The pandemic proved to be relatively mild and was not as serious as originally predicted. As in other countries, most cases reported in the UK were mild. However, a small number of cases resulted in serious illness and death. These were mostly in the very elderly, very young, pregnant women, or people with a pre-existing health condition, such as cancer, that had already weakened their immune systems. On August 10 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic was officially over. The virus now circulates worldwide as one of three seasonal flu viruses. The other viruses are influenza virus B and influenza virus A\/H3N2. Symptoms of flu The symptoms of flu caused by the H1N1pdm09 virus are similar to those of other types, and include: a sudden fever \u2013 a temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above tiredness aching muscles or joint pain a headache a runny or blocked nose Most people recover within a week, even without special treatment. However, some people are at a higher risk of complications and are recommended to have the seasonal flu jab. The 2015-16 seasonal flu jab includes protection against three types of flu virus, including H1N1pdm09. When to see your GP If you are otherwise fit and healthy, there is usually no need to visit your GP if you have flu-like symptoms. See your GP if you have flu-like symptoms and are at a higher risk of complications of seasonal flu. This includes: children under two years old anyone over the age of 65 pregnant women children and adults with an underlying health condition (particularly long-term heart or respiratory disease) children and adults with weakened immune systems Vaccination The seasonal flu jab is available for free on the NHS for those at risk and is given as an annual injection to: adults over the age of 18 at risk of flu (including everyone over 65) children aged from six months to two years who are at risk of flu The flu vaccine is also offered as an annual nasal spray to: children aged 2 to 18 years at risk of flu children aged two, three and four all children in school years 1 and 2 Read more information about who should have the flu jab and why pregnant women should have the flu jab. How is swine flu treated? The best remedy is to rest at home, keep warm and drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. You can take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower a high temperature and relieve aches. If further treatment is needed or complications develop, medication is available to treat flu caused by the H1N1pdm09 virus. This includes: antiviral medications \u2013 oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) help relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of serious complications antibiotics \u2013 to combat bacterial infections such as pneumonia, which may occur as a complication of influenza If you are prescribed antivirals, you will need to pay a prescription charge (unless your prescriptions are normally free of charge). Read the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on antivirals for the treatment of flu.  Preventing the spread of flu The H1N1pdm09 virus is spread in exactly the same way as the common cold and other flu viruses. The virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when someone coughs or sneezes. These droplets typically spread about 1 metre (3 feet). They hang suspended in the air for a while, but then land on surfaces, where the virus can survive for up to 24 hours. Anyone who touches these surfaces can spread the virus by touching anything else. The virus is also transmitted by infected people who cough or sneeze into their hands and then touch other people or objects before washing their hands. Everyday items at home and in public places may have traces of the virus. These include food, door handles, remote controls, hand rails, paper money and computer keyboards. People usually become infected by picking up the virus on their hands from contaminated objects and then placing their hands near their mouth or nose. It is also possible to breathe in the virus if it is suspended in airborne droplets. Good hygiene, such as hand washing and cleaning, is the most effective way of slowing the spread of flu. Antiviral medication and the seasonal flu jab are also offered to people at risk. Read more information about: preventing seasonal flu home hygiene You can also read the NICE guidelines on antivirals for the prevention of flu.

It spreads rapidly through small droplets coughed or sneezed into the air by an infected person. Some people are at greater risk of developing serious complications of flu, such as bronchitis and pneumonia. The flu vaccination is offered to people in at-risk groups.

It can help to prevent tooth decay, which is why it's added to many brands of toothpaste and, in some areas, to the water supply through a process called fluoridation (see below).  Tooth decay Tooth decay, also known as dental decay or dental caries, is a major health concern worldwide and is still a big problem in the UK. Despite being preventable, it's one of the most common reasons for hospital admission in children. Tooth decay is the destruction of tooth tissue caused by acids made by bacteria in dental plaque. Dental plaque is a sticky film that constantly forms on the teeth. Each time you have sugary food and drink, the bacteria in plaque produce acid that attacks teeth. If you eat or drink sugary foods frequently throughout the day, you have more \"acid attacks\" which can lead to tooth decay. This can eventually lead to cavities (holes) in the teeth and infection, which is why teeth sometimes need to be removed. Read more about the causes of tooth decay. Fluoride toothpaste Brushing your teeth thoroughly with fluoride toothpaste is one of the most effective ways of preventing tooth decay. A range of toothpastes are available that contain different levels of fluoride. The amount of fluoride that\u2019s in the toothpaste can be found on the side of the tube and is measured in parts per million (ppm). Toothpastes containing 1350-1500ppm fluoride are the most effective. Your dentist may advise you to use higher-strength toothpaste if you or your child is at particular risk of tooth decay. Children under three years old should brush twice daily, with a smear of toothpaste containing no less than 1000ppm fluoride. Children between three and six years old should brush at least twice daily with a pea-sized amount of toothpaste containing more than 1000ppm fluoride.  Adults should brush at least twice daily with a toothpaste containing 1350-1500ppm fluoride.  Don\u2019t use mouthwash at the same time as brushing. Use it at an alternative time, because it washes away the fluoride in the toothpaste Read more about looking after your baby's teeth, children's teeth, and how to keep your teeth clean. Fluoride dental treatments Fluoride mouth rinses Fluoride mouth rinses can be prescribed for adults and children aged eight and above who have tooth decay. They should be used every day, in addition to brushing twice daily with toothpaste containing at least 1350ppm fluoride. Rinses should be used at different times to brushing to avoid washing the toothpaste off your teeth, as this reduces the beneficial effects of the fluoride in the toothpaste. Fluoride varnish Fluoride varnish can be applied to both baby teeth and adult teeth by a dentist. The process involves painting a varnish containing high levels of fluoride onto the surface of the tooth every six months to prevent decay. It works by strengthening tooth enamel, making it more resistant to decay. From the age of three, children should be offered fluoride varnish treatment at least twice a year. Fluoride varnish should be offered two or more times a year for children of all ages with tooth decay or those at high risk of developing it. Ask your dentist about fluoride varnish. Find a dentist near you. Community water fluoridation Most water supplies contain some fluoride and in the early 20th century, levels of tooth decay were found to be associated with fluoride levels in drinking water. This led to the introduction of water fluoridation schemes to add fluoride to water supplies to improve dental health. Community water fluoridation schemes have operated for over 70 years; the first fluoridation scheme was introduced in the US in 1945. The first substantive UK scheme was established in Birmingham in 1964. Community water fluoridation in England Around 5.8 million people in England receive fluoridated water. This means fluoride has been added to bring it up to around 1mg of fluoride per litre of water, which is a level found to reduce tooth decay levels. The decision about whether to add fluoride to the water supply is made by individual local authorities. Areas where water fluoridation schemes are currently in place include parts of: the West Midlands the North East the East Midlands Eastern England the North West  Yorkshire and Humber In some parts of the country, such as parts of the North East and Midlands, the public water supply naturally contains a level of fluoride that's similar to that seen in schemes. Some private water supplies contain more than this amount. Your local water supplier should be able to tell you how much fluoride is in your water supply and whether any is added. Most companies have an online facility where you can use your postcode to check the water in your area. What research has been carried out? Over the past 50 years, there have been several reviews of the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation schemes. Recent large reviews that have been carried out include: Public Health England: Water fluoridation health monitoring report for England (PDF, 1.51Mb) \u2013 in 2014 (read the NHS Choices coverage of this report) NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination: A systematic review of water fluoridation (PDF, 6.22Mb) \u2013 in 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US): Recommendations on selected interventions to prevent dental caries, oral and pharyngeal cancers and sports-related craniofacial injuries (PDF, 69kb) \u2013 in 2002 National Health and Medical Research Council (Australian Government): Efficacy and safety of fluoridation \u2013 in 2007 US Department of Health and Human Services Community Preventive Services Task Force: Community water fluoridation \u2013 in 2013 Royal Society of New Zealand: Health effects of water fluoridation (PDF, 1Mb) \u2013 in 2014 Health Research Board (Ireland): Health effects of water fluoridation (PDF, 1.58Mb) \u2013 in 2015 Cochrane Oral Health Group: Water fluoridation for the prevention of dental caries \u2013 in 2015 Overall, these reviews found that water fluoridation appears to contribute to reduced tooth decay levels and doesn't seem to be associated with any significant health risks (see below). Is fluoride safe? There have been some concerns that fluoride may be linked to a variety of health conditions. Reviews of the risks (see above) have so far found no convincing evidence to support these concerns. However, a condition called dental fluorosis can sometimes occur if a child's teeth are exposed to too much fluoride when they're developing. Read more about looking after children's teeth. Mild dental fluorosis can be seen as very fine pearly white lines or flecking on the surface of the teeth. Severe fluorosis can cause the tooth's enamel to become pitted or discoloured. It's uncommon in the UK for fluorosis to be severe enough to seriously affect the appearance of teeth. This is because fluoride levels in water are carefully monitored by the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) and adjusted if necessary.

The mental and physical problems that can develop in the baby are known as \"foetal alcohol syndrome\". Foetal alcohol syndrome, also referred to as fetal alcohol syndrome, is completely avoidable if you don't drink alcohol while you're pregnant. Experts are still unsure exactly how much alcohol is safe for you to have while pregnant, which is why not drinking at all is the safest approach. How would alcohol reach the unborn baby? A baby in the womb gets its nourishment from the mother's bloodstream. If the mother drinks alcohol, this easily passes from her blood through the placenta to her baby's blood. A baby's liver is one of the last organs to develop fully and doesn't mature until the later stages of pregnancy. This means that the baby cannot process alcohol as well as the mother can. What effect does alcohol have on the baby? Exposure to alcohol can seriously affect the baby's development, particularly the brain and spinal cord.  Alcohol damages the important cells in the baby's body that are necessary for growth and also disrupts the connection of the nerves in the brain. The damage to the cells by alcohol results in poor growth, smaller body size and a delay in development. Alcohol is potentially most harmful for the baby in the first three months of pregnancy. At this stage, it is linked to miscarriage and birth abnormalities. However, alcohol can harm a baby at any stage of pregnancy. Larger amounts of alcohol appear to increase the problems: binge drinking is more harmful than drinking small amounts of alcohol. However, there is no \"safe\" level of alcohol use during pregnancy. What are the symptoms of foetal alcohol syndrome? Drinking alcohol while pregnant has been associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, premature labour and problems with the way the baby grows and develops in the womb. A baby exposed to alcohol in the womb is more prone to illness, physical problems, and learning and behavioural disorders. It may have any of the following problems: poor growth while in the womb and after birth, so the baby is shorter and smaller than average, sometimes with deformed limbs  small head and jaw distinctive facial features, especially: - small eyes set far apart - a thin upper lip - a smooth philtrum (ridge that runs below the nose to the top lip)   cerebral palsy \u2013 a problem in the parts of the brain responsible for controlling muscles, which affects movement and co-ordination learning disorders \u2013 problems with thinking, speech, social skills and\/or memory (for example, finding it difficult to translate thinking into saying, or reading into speaking)  mood, attention or behavioural problems \u2013 for example, autistic-like behaviour, ADHD or sleep problems problems with the liver, kidneys, heart or other organs hearing and sight problems epilepsy  a weak immune system Some children may only develop mild symptoms, while others may be severely affected. If children with foetal alcohol syndrome are not diagnosed early and given the support they need, they are likely to face a range of issues in later life. Because of their problems, they may misuse drugs and alcohol and become expelled from school, develop mental health problems, and find it difficult to get a job and live independently as adults. How is foetal alcohol syndrome diagnosed? Doctors may suspect foetal alcohol syndrome in a baby after it has been born if it has some of the distinctive facial features and hasn't grown fully, and it's thought that the mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. However, the diagnosis cannot be confirmed until the child shows clear features of delayed development and the mother's alcohol habit has been confirmed. Doctors do also check for other causes of the child's delayed development, including genetic abnormalities. They will usually carry out a thorough physical examination of the baby to check for physical abnormalities. Some children who have suffered brain damage from alcohol won't have the classic facial features of foetal alcohol syndrome, but they could still be severely affected. So it's important that children who show some or all of the behavioural and developmental problems described are assessed if it's known that the mother drank alcohol in pregnancy. What's the outlook for a child with foetal alcohol syndrome? There is no particular treatment for a child with foetal alcohol syndrome. The brain damage is not reversible, although early assessment and diagnosis does make all the difference to the child's progress in life. It's important that the child is referred to a team of healthcare professionals who are experienced in assessing and diagnosing foetal alcohol syndrome and who can also advise on the appropriate educational and behavioural strategies for the children. The child will then be better equipped to cope with their physical, behavioural and developmental problems.  Children with foetal alcohol syndrome do tend to have growth delay. The facial deformities may sometimes be less noticeable as the child ages, but they may be shorter than average and have a much smaller head size. Where can I go for support? It's never too late to stop drinking. If you're pregnant and struggling with an alcohol problem, ask your midwife, doctor or pharmacist for support or advice.

They produce raised red spots, which can sometimes become infected and turn into painful, pus-filled sores. Ingrown hairs can be itchy and embarrassing, but they often go away on their own without doing anything. Anyone can get ingrown hairs, but they tend to be more of a problem in people with coarse or curly hair. This topic covers: What causes ingrown hairs? What to do If there are lots of pus-filled spots Preventing ingrown hairs Other possible skin conditions  What causes ingrown hairs? Ingrown hairs have usually grown out of the skin, curled back round and re-entered the skin. Some curl back into the hair follicle \u2013 small cavities in the skin that hairs grow out of \u2013 without even exiting the skin. An ingrown hair can occur when the hair follicle becomes clogged with dead skin cells. This forces the hair inside it to grow sideways, which is much more likely to happen if the hair is already curly or coarse and it's recently been shaved. Ingrown hairs can be a particular problem in the areas where you shave \u2013 the beard area in men, and the legs, armpits and pubic area in women. In these places, the hair that grows back has a sharper edge and can easily poke back into the skin. Ingrown hairs look like pimples in the skin, and sometimes you can see the hair trapped beneath the skin. The spots can be filled with pus. What to do If possible, you should leave ingrown hairs for a while as they may disappear without you having to do anything.  Don't pick or scratch an ingrown hair as bacteria can enter the small wound created, increasing your risk of infection. It can also cause scarring. You should also avoid squeezing the spots because it can damage the skin and lead to infection. If an ingrown hair is near the surface of your skin, you could use a sterile needle or tweezers to gently tease it out. However, don't dig for the hair if it lies deep below the skin's surface. Men who are prone to getting ingrown hairs around their face may find it best to grow out their beard. Longer hairs aren't as sharp at the ends, so are less likely to become ingrown. If there are lots of pus-filled spots The hair follicles of ingrown hairs can sometimes become infected and inflamed. This is known as folliculitis. The hair follicles will swell into pus-filled spots, although pus doesn't always mean there's an infection. Again, mild cases of folliculitis often clear up without treatment, so try not shaving for a few days and see if it gets better. You could also try dabbing a mild antiseptic, such as tea tree oil, on to the affected area. See your GP if the spots don't improve and are bothering you. If one particular spot is a problem, your GP may be able to release the ingrown hair using a sterile needle. Antibiotics are usually only needed if the skin is severely infected with pustules and abscesses. Preventing ingrown hairs The simplest way to prevent ingrowing hairs is to let your hair grow freely without shaving it. You may want to try this for a brief period if you need relief from particularly bad spots.  If you don't want to stop shaving, the following shaving tips may help: use a sharp, single-bladed razor wet your skin with warm water and use a gel shave in the direction the hairs are growing use as few strokes of the razor as possible rinse the razor after every stroke try not to shave too closely \u2013 leave a bit of stubble if you can, as bacteria can enter the tiny openings of freshly shaved skin Other hair removal methods may be less likely to result in ingrowing hairs. For example, instead of shaving your legs, you may want to try depilatory creams, electrolysis or laser removal. Other possible skin conditions There are many skin conditions that can easily be mistaken for ingrown hairs, including: keratosis pilaris (\"chicken skin\") \u2013 a common, harmless condition where the skin becomes rough and bumpy, as if covered in permanent goose pimples acne  a cyst or abscess eczema  impetigo \u2013 a highly contagious skin infection that mainly affects children  heat rash (prickly heat) pustular psoriasis molluscum contagiosum \u2013 a highly contagious viral infection that affects the skin  See your GP if you're unsure. The above links will take you to more information about these similar-looking skin conditions.

It's thought to affect at least one in 50,000 people. Symptoms vary, but almost everyone with the condition will have abnormal nails and many also have problems with their elbows, knees and pelvis. However, most people are able to lead relatively normal lives. Typical features The main signs and symptoms of nail patella syndrome are listed below. Someone with the condition may not have all these symptoms and some symptoms may be more severe than others. Some of the problems will be obvious from birth, but others may not become apparent until later on. Nail abnormalities Nearly all people with nail patella syndrome will have abnormal or missing nails, which is usually apparent at birth. The base of each nail is often triangular, rather than a curved crescent shape, and the nails themselves may be underdeveloped, discoloured, split, ridged or pitted.  Thumbnails are the most severely affected, and the nails are less severely affected from the index finger towards the little finger. Toenails are generally less affected than fingernails. Other features Other areas of the body that can be affected include the bones and joints, kidneys and eyes. Common features include: knees \u2013 missing kneecaps (patellas) or kneecaps that are small, irregularly shaped and easily dislocated (may feel unstable or painful) arms and elbows \u2013 not able to fully extend the arms or turn the palms up while keeping elbows straight, and elbows may angle outwards  pelvis \u2013 bony growths (iliac horns) on the pelvic bone may be visible on X-rays, but don't usually cause problems eyes \u2013 increased pressure within the eyes (glaucoma) at an early age kidneys \u2013 there may be protein in the urine (an early sign of kidney problems) and this can be accompanied by blood in the urine; in some cases, this can progress to kidney disease, with high blood pressure and kidney failure nerves \u2013 numbness and a tingling or burning sensation in the hands and feet circulation \u2013 poor blood circulation in the hands and feet, causing them to feel cold, even in warm weather digestive system \u2013 about one in three people have constipation or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) body size \u2013 difficulty putting on weight, particularly muscle, despite eating and exercising well, with little muscle mass in the upper arms and upper legs thin bones (osteoporosis) \u2013 notably in the hips hairline \u2013 the hairline may be high, particularly at the temples It has also been suggested that people with nail patella syndrome may be more likely to have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or depression, although more research is needed to confirm this. What causes nail patella syndrome? Most people with nail patella syndrome will have inherited a defective version of a gene called LMX1B from one of their parents. This gene is important in the development of a baby's limbs, nails, kidneys and eyes. Only one of the two copies of the gene needs to be faulty for a person to be affected (dominant inheritance). This means a child of someone with nail patella syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. However, there is not always a family history of nail patella syndrome. In some cases, the LMX1B gene will have mutated (altered) spontaneously.  Read more about how genetic conditions are inherited. Genetic testing The diagnosis of nail patella syndrome is usually based on the symptoms you or your child has. However, when the diagnosis is not clear, a genetic blood test can be used to confirm the diagnosis by finding out whether a person is carrying a mutated LMX1B gene. A mutation in this gene can be identified in 95% of people with nail patella syndrome.  Genetic testing can also be carried out during pregnancy to find out if a child will be born with nail patella syndrome, although this cannot predict how severe the condition will be. Another option for couples at risk of having a child with nail patella syndrome is a technique called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This involves testing embryos that have been fertilised using in vitro fertilisation (IVF), and only implanting embryos that have not inherited nail patella syndrome into the womb. Before genetic testing or PGD, genetic counselling will be offered. This service is provided by healthcare professionals specially trained in the science of human genetics (a genetic counsellor or a clinical geneticist) and is available at regional genetics centres across the country. The counsellor will discuss the risks, benefits and limitations of genetic testing. They will also explain how the information found as a result of genetic testing could have implications for both you and your family. Read more about genetic testing and counselling. Managing nail patella syndrome There is no cure for nail patella syndrome, but treatments are available to manage the symptoms. For example, knees that are easily dislocated and painful can be helped with painkillers, physiotherapy, splinting and bracing. However, long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) painkillers should be avoided, because these can affect the kidneys. Some people may need corrective surgery for problems with the bones and joints. Annual urine tests to look for kidney problems should begin at birth. If problems develop, these may need to be controlled with medication or dialysis (where a machine is used to replicate many of the kidney\u2019s functions). People with severe kidney disease may need to have a kidney transplant. Women with high blood pressure caused by kidney problems will need to be carefully monitored if they become pregnant, as pregnancy can make high blood pressure worse. Screening for glaucoma should start in the teenage years and be repeated at least every two years. Treatment for glaucoma may involve using eye drops or having a procedure to reduce the pressure inside the eye. Read more about testing for glaucoma and treating glaucoma. Assessment of bone density is recommended for young adults to check for osteoporosis. Read more about testing for osteoporosis. Information about you If you or your child has nail patella syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you\/them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

Although allergic reactions are often mild, they can be very serious. Symptoms of a food allergy can affect different areas of the body at the same time. Some common symptoms include: an itchy sensation inside the mouth, throat or ears a raised itchy red rash (urticaria, or \"hives\") swelling of the face, around the eyes, lips, tongue and roof of the mouth (angioedema) vomiting Read more about the symptoms of food allergies. Anaphylaxis In the most serious cases, a person has a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which can be life threatening. If you think someone has the symptoms of anaphylaxis \u2013 such as breathing difficulties, lightheadedness, and feeling like they're going to faint or lose consciousness \u2013 call 999. Ask for an ambulance and tell the operator you think the person has anaphylaxis or \"anaphylactic shock\". What causes food allergies? Food allergies happen when the immune system \u2013 the body's defence against infection \u2013 mistakenly treats proteins found in food as a threat. As a result, a number of chemicals are released. It's these chemicals that cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction. Almost any food can cause an allergic reaction, but there are certain foods that are responsible for most food allergies. In children, the foods that most commonly cause an allergic reaction are: milk eggs peanuts tree nuts fish shellfish Most children that have a food allergy will have experienced eczema during infancy. The worse the child's eczema and the earlier it started, the more likely they are to have a food allergy. In adults, the foods that most commonly cause an allergic reaction are: peanuts tree nuts \u2013 such as walnuts, brazil nuts, almonds and hazelnuts fruits \u2013 such as apples and peaches fish shellfish \u2013 such as crab, lobster and prawns It's still unknown why people develop allergies to food, although they often have other allergic conditions, such as asthma, hay fever and eczema. Read more information about the causes and risk factors for food allergies. Types of food allergies Food allergies are divided into three types, depending on symptoms and when they occur. IgE-mediated food allergy \u2013 the most common type, triggered by the immune system producing an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE). Symptoms occur a few seconds or minutes after eating. There's a greater risk of anaphylaxis with this type of allergy. non-IgE-mediated food allergy \u2013 these allergic reactions aren't caused by immunoglobulin E, but by other cells in the immune system. This type of allergy is often difficult to diagnose as symptoms take much longer to develop (up to several hours). mixed IgE and non-IgE-mediated food allergies \u2013 some people may experience symptoms from both types. Read more information about the symptoms of a food allergy. Oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food syndrome) Some people experience itchiness in their mouth and throat, sometimes with mild swelling, immediately after eating fresh fruit or vegetables. This is known as oral allergy syndrome. Oral allergy syndrome is caused by allergy antibodies mistaking certain proteins in fresh fruits, nuts or vegetables for pollen. Oral allergy syndrome generally doesn't cause severe symptoms, and it's possible to deactivate the allergens by thoroughly cooking any fruit and vegetables. Some people with pollen-food syndrome may have more severe symptoms. The Allergy UK website has more information on oral allergy syndrome. Treatment The best way of preventing an allergic reaction is to identify the food that causes the allergy and avoid it. Research is currently looking at ways to desensitise some food allergens, such as peanuts and milk, but this is not an established treatment. Read more about identifying foods that cause allergies (allergens). Avoid making any radical changes, such as cutting out dairy products, to your or your child's diet without first talking to your GP. For some foods, such as milk, you may need to speak to a dietitian before making any changes. A type of medication called an antihistamine can help relieve the symptoms of a mild or moderate allergic reaction. A higher dose of antihistamine is often needed to control acute allergic symptoms. Adrenaline is an effective treatment for more severe allergic symptoms, such as anaphylaxis. People with a food allergy are often given a device known as an auto-injector pen, which contains doses of adrenaline that can be used in emergencies. Read more about the treatment of food allergies.  When to seek medical advice If you think you or your child may have a food allergy, it's very important to ask for a professional diagnosis from your GP. They can then refer you to an allergy clinic if appropriate. Many parents mistakenly assume their child has a food allergy when their symptoms are actually caused by a completely different condition. Commercial allergy testing kits are available, but using them isn't recommended. Many kits are based on unsound scientific principles. Even if they're reliable, you should have the results looked at by a health professional. Read more about diagnosing food allergies. Who's affected? Most food allergies affect younger children under the age of three. It's estimated around 1 in every 14 children of this age has at least one food allergy. Most children who have food allergies to milk, eggs, soya and wheat in early life will grow out of it by the time they start school. Peanut and tree nut allergies are usually more persistent. An estimated four out of five children with peanut allergies remain allergic to peanuts for the rest of their lives. Food allergies that develop during adulthood, or persist into adulthood, are likely to be lifelong allergies. For reasons that are unclear, rates of food allergies have risen sharply in the last 20 years. However, deaths from anaphylaxis-related food reactions are now rare. There are around 10 deaths related to food allergies in England and Wales each year. Food allergy and intolerance myth buster There are many myths about food allergies and intolerances \u2013 can you tell fact from fiction? And what is the difference between the two?  What is food intolerance? A food intolerance isn't the same as a food allergy. People with food intolerance may have symptoms such as diarrhoea, bloating and stomach cramps. This may be caused by difficulties digesting certain substances, such as lactose. However, no allergic reaction takes place. Important differences between a food allergy and a food intolerance include: the symptoms of a food intolerance usually occur several hours after eating the food you need to eat a larger amount of food to trigger an intolerance than an allergy a food intolerance is never life threatening, unlike an allergy Read more about the differences between food allergy and food intolerance.

When should I introduce my baby to solid foods? Media last reviewed: 28\/01\/2015 Next review due: 28\/01\/2017 When to start introducing solid foods Introducing your baby to solid foods \u2013 sometimes called weaning or complementary feeding \u2013 should start when your baby is around six months old. It's a really important step in their development, and it can be great fun to explore new flavours and textures together. To begin with, how much your baby takes is less important than getting them used to the idea of eating. They will still be getting most of their nutrition from breast milk or infant formula.  Babies don't need three meals a day to start with, so you can begin by offering foods at a time that suits you both. Gradually, you'll be able to increase the amount and variety of food your baby eats, until they can eventually eat the same as the rest of the family, in smaller portions. Why it pays to wait until they're ready Research shows babies can get all the nutrients they need from breast milk or infant formula until they are around six months old. Waiting till then gives their digestive system time to develop fully so it can cope with solid foods. This includes solid foods made into purées and cereals added to milk. If you are breastfeeding, having breast milk alone up to the age of six months will protect your baby against infections. Breast milk will carry on protecting them from infections for as long as you carry on feeding. Whether your baby has breast milk or infant formula, waiting until they are ready for food will save a lot of time, too. They'll quickly be able to feed themselves and with less mess, as they will be able to swallow properly. Three signs your baby is ready for their first food Every baby is an individual, but there are three clear signs that, together, show your baby is ready for solid foods alongside breast milk or formula. It's very rare for these signs to appear together before your baby is six months old. 1. They can stay in a sitting position and hold their head steady. 2. They can co-ordinate their eyes, hands and mouth so they can look at the food, pick it up and put it in their mouth, all by themselves. 3. They can swallow food. Babies who are not ready will push their food back out with their tongue, so they get more round their face than they do in their mouths. Some signs that can be mistaken for a baby being ready for solid foods: chewing fists waking in the night when they have previously slept through wanting extra milk feeds These are normal behaviours and not necessarily a sign of hunger or being ready to start solid food. Starting solid foods won't make them any more likely to sleep through the night. Extra feeds are usually enough until they're ready for other food. Getting started with solid foods Always stay with your baby when they are eating in case they start to choke. Find out how to help a choking child. Let your baby enjoy touching and holding the food. Allow your baby to feed themselves, using their fingers, as soon as they show an interest. Don't force your baby to eat \u2013 wait until the next time if they're not interested this time. If you're using a spoon, wait for your baby to open their mouth before you offer the food. Your baby may like to hold a spoon, too. Start by offering just a few pieces or teaspoons of food, once a day. Cool hot food and test it before giving it to your baby. Don't add salt, sugar or stock cubes to your baby's food or cooking water. See what other foods to avoid giving your baby. What foods to give your baby as they grow Feeding your baby from 0-6 months Your baby only needs breast milk or first infant formula. \"Follow-on\" formula isn't suitable for babies under six months, and you don't need to introduce it after six months either. Check with your health visitor or GP first if you want to introduce solid foods before six months. Babies and food allergies While variety in your baby's diet is really important, there is a chance they may be allergic to certain foods. That's why it's important to introduce cows' milk, eggs, wheat, gluten, nuts, peanuts, peanut products, seeds, fish and shellfish one at a time and not before six months. There is no evidence that waiting until your child is older will prevent them developing a food allergy. Once your baby is ready for solids, give them these foods in very small amounts and watch carefully for any symptoms of an allergic reaction. If your baby already has a known allergy, such as a diagnosed food allergy or eczema, or you have a family history of food allergies, eczema, asthma or hay fever, you may need to be particularly careful when introducing peanuts and peanut products. Talk to your GP or health visitor first. Remember, peanuts, like all nuts, should be crushed or ground. See more about food allergies in babies and toddlers. Baby food from 6 months First foods Your baby's first foods can include mashed or soft cooked fruit and vegetables like parsnip, potato, yam, sweet potato, carrot, apple or pear, all cooled before eating. Soft fruits like peach or melon, or baby rice or baby cereal mixed with your baby's usual milk, are good as well. Keep feeding your baby breast milk or infant formula, too, but don't give them whole cows' milk as a drink until they are one year old. Finger foods Finger food is food that is cut up into pieces big enough for your baby to hold in their fist with a bit sticking out. Pieces about the size of your own finger work well. Your baby learns to chew this way. Try grabbable bits of soft, ripe banana or avocado. Next foods  Once your baby is used to the foods above, they can have soft cooked meat such as chicken, mashed fish (check very carefully for any bones), pasta, noodles, toast, pieces of chapatti, lentils, rice and mashed hard-boiled eggs. They can also have full-fat dairy products such as yoghurt, fromage frais or custard. Choose products with no added sugar or less sugar. Whole cows' milk can be used in cooking or mixed with food from six months. Cups Introduce a cup from around six months and offer sips of water with meals. Using an open cup or a free-flow cup without a valve will help your baby learn to sip and is better for their teeth. See more about cups for babies and toddlers. Vitamins The Department of Health recommends that all under-fives are given vitamin supplements containing vitamins A, C and D every day.  Babies who are having more than 500ml (about a pint) of infant formula a day shouldn't be given vitamin supplements because formula is already fortified with nutrients. Read more about vitamins for babies and toddlers. Feeding your baby from 8-9 months Your baby will gradually move towards eating three meals a day. It will be a mixture of soft finger foods, and mashed or chopped foods. Your baby's diet should consist of a variety of the following: fruit and vegetables; bread, rice, pasta, potatoes and other starchy foods; meat, fish, eggs, beans and other non-dairy sources of protein; and milk and dairy products. See advice on portion size (PDF, 3.6Mb) from First Steps Nutrition. Your baby's food from 12 months Your baby will now be eating three meals a day, chopped if necessary, plus breast milk or whole cows' milk and healthier snacks like fruit, vegetable sticks, toast and rice cakes. They can now drink whole cows' milk. Choose full-fat dairy products as children under two need the extra fat and vitamins found in them. From two years old, if they are a good eater and growing well, they can have semi-skimmed milk. From five years old, 1% fat and skimmed milk is OK. You can give your baby: three to four servings a day of starchy food such as potatoes, bread and rice three to four servings a day of fruit and vegetables two servings a day of meat, fish, eggs, dhal or other pulses (beans and lentils) Read more about what to feed young children. What milk, when? For around the first six months you should feed your baby only breast milk or infant formula. Infant formula made from cows' or goats' milk is the only suitable alternative to breast milk in the first 12 months of your baby's life. Only use soya-based infant formula if your GP has advised you to. Follow-on milks are available for babies over six months, but there is no need to change over to these. Cows' milk can be mixed with food from six months and whole cows' milk can be given as a drink from one year. Semi-skimmed milk can be introduced once your child is two years old, as long as they're a good eater and they have a varied diet. Skimmed and 1% milk aren't suitable for children under five, as they don't contain enough calories. Infant formula, follow-on formula or growing-up milks are not needed once your baby is 12 months old. Goats' and sheep's milk are not suitable as a drink for babies under one year. You can give your child unsweetened calcium-fortified milk alternatives, such as soya, almond and oat drinks, as part of a healthy, balanced diet from the age of one. Toddlers and young children under the age of five should not be given rice drinks because of the levels of arsenic they contain. If your child has an allergy or intolerance to milk, talk to your health visitor or GP. They can advise you on suitable milk alternatives. See more about drinks for babies and toddlers.

These colours include: sunset yellow (E110)  quinoline yellow (E104) carmoisine (E122) allura red (E129) tartrazine (E102) ponceau 4R (E124) These colours are used in a number of foods, including soft drinks, sweets, cakes and ice cream. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has published a list of manufacturers with food ranges free from the six colours. What are E numbers? All food additives, whether natural or artificial, must go through a rigorous safety assessment and approval procedure, and must comply with European Union (EU) legislation. They're only allowed to be used if experts decide they're necessary and safe. If a food additive has an E number, this shows it's passed safety tests and has been approved for use throughout the EU. If colours are used in food they must be declared in the list of ingredients as 'colour', with either their name or E number. If any of the six colours listed above are in food or drink, the food label must also have a specific warning saying that the colour 'may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children'. You can avoid certain additives by checking the label. If you buy foods without packaging, you'll need to check with the manufacturer or the person selling the product. The advice about food additives and hyperactivity was issued after being evaluated by the independent Committee on Toxicity and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) following research commissioned by the FSA. The FSA is encouraging manufacturers to work towards finding alternatives to these food colours. Some manufacturers and retailers have already taken action to remove them. The FSA website has more information about where to find products free from the colours associated with hyperactivity. You should also be aware that certain additives, such as sulphites, can cause allergic reactions. Read more about the causes of food allergy. The difference between hyperactivity and ADHD In the context of this advice, hyperactivity is when a child is overactive, can't concentrate and acts on sudden impulses without thinking about alternatives. Experts think hyperactivity affects 2-5% of children in the UK. There's no single test for diagnosing it. It's important to remember that hyperactivity is also associated with factors other than additives, including premature birth, genetics and upbringing. ADHD is more than just hyperactive behaviour. It's linked to a specific pattern of behaviour, including reduced attention span and difficulty concentrating, to the extent that the child\u2019s ability to learn and function at home and school is affected. Children with ADHD often have learning difficulties and behavioural problems.   Page last reviewed: 18\/02\/2015 Next review due: 18\/02\/2017 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

It's not usually serious and most people get better within a few days without treatment. In most cases of food poisoning, the food is contaminated by bacteria, such as salmonella or Escherichia coli (E. coli), or a virus, such as the norovirus. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of food poisoning usually begin within one to two days of eating contaminated food, although they may start at any point between a few hours and several weeks later. The main symptoms include: feeling sick (nausea) vomiting diarrhoea, which may contain blood or mucus stomach cramps and abdominal (tummy) pain a lack of energy and weakness loss of appetite a high temperature (fever) aching muscles chills In most cases, these symptoms will pass in a few days and you will make a full recovery. What to do Most people with food poisoning recover at home and don't need any specific treatment, although there are some situations where you should see your GP for advice (see below). Until you feel better, you should rest and drink fluids to prevent dehydration. Try to drink plenty of water, even if you can only sip it. Eat when you feel up to it, but try small, light meals at first and stick to bland foods \u2013 such as toast, crackers, bananas and rice \u2013 until you begin to feel better. Oral rehydration solutions (ORS), which are available from pharmacies, are recommended for more vulnerable people, such as the elderly and those with another health condition. Read more about treating food poisoning. When to see your GP You should contact your GP if: your symptoms are severe \u2013 for example, if you're unable to keep down any fluids because you are vomiting repeatedly your symptoms don't start to improve after a few days you have symptoms of severe dehydration, such as confusion, a rapid heartbeat, sunken eyes and passing little or no urine you're pregnant you're over 60 your baby or young child has suspected food poisoning you have a long-term underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), heart valve disease, diabetes or kidney disease you have a weak immune system \u2013 for example, because of medication, cancer treatment or HIV In these situations, your GP may send off a stool sample for analysis and prescribe antibiotics, or they may refer you to hospital so you can be looked after more closely. How is food contaminated? Food can become contaminated at any stage during production, processing or cooking.

It's also sometimes called drop foot, and can cause you to drag your foot on the ground when you walk. Foot drop is a sign of an underlying problem rather than a condition itself. This could be muscular, caused by nerve damage in the leg, or the result of a brain or spinal injury. Foot drop usually only affects one foot, but both feet may be affected, depending on the cause. It can be temporary or permanent. What causes foot drop? Foot drop is the result of weakness or paralysis of the muscles that lift the front part of your foot. This can be caused by a number of underlying problems, which are described below. Muscle weakness Muscular dystrophy is a group of inherited genetic conditions that cause gradual muscle weakness and can sometimes lead to foot drop. Foot drop can also be caused by other muscle wasting conditions, such as spinal muscular atrophy or motor neurone disease. Peripheral nerve problems or neuropathy Foot drop is often caused by compression (squashing) of the nerve that controls the muscles that lift the foot. Sometimes, nerves around the knee or lower spine can become trapped. The nerves in the leg can also be injured or damaged during hip replacement or knee replacement surgery. Foot drop can sometimes be caused by nerve damage linked to diabetes (known as a neuropathy). Inherited conditions that cause peripheral nerve damage and muscle weakness, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, can also sometimes lead to foot drop. Brain and spinal cord disorders Foot drop can also be caused by conditions that affect the brain or spinal cord, such as: stroke cerebral palsy multiple sclerosis Diagnosing foot drop Foot drop is often diagnosed during a physical examination. Your GP will look at the way you walk and examine your leg muscles. In some cases, imaging tests, such as an X-ray, ultrasound scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan, may be required. Nerve conduction tests may be recommended to help locate where the affected nerve is damaged. Electromyography, where electrodes are inserted into the muscle fibres to record the muscles' electrical activity, may also be carried out at the same time. Managing foot drop If you have foot drop, you'll find it difficult to lift the front part of your foot off the ground. This means you'll have a tendency to scuff your toes along the ground, increasing your risk of falls. To prevent this, you may lift your foot higher than usual when walking. Recovery depends on the cause of foot drop and how long you've had it. In some cases it can be permanent. Making small changes in your home, such as removing clutter and using non-slip rugs and mats, can help prevent falls. There are also measures you can take to help stabilise your foot and improve your walking ability. These measures include: physiotherapy \u2013 to strengthen your foot, ankle and lower leg muscles wearing an ankle-foot orthosis \u2013 to hold your foot in a normal position electrical nerve stimulation \u2013 in certain cases it can help lift the foot surgery \u2013 an operation to fuse the ankle or foot bones may be possible in severe or long-term cases Some of these treatments are discussed in more detail below. Ankle-foot orthosis An ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) is worn on the lower part of the leg to help control the ankle and foot. It holds your foot and ankle in a straightened position to improve your walking. If your GP thinks an AFO will help, they'll refer you for an assessment with an orthotist (a specialist who measures and prescribes orthoses). Wearing a close-fitting sock between your skin and the AFO will ensure comfort and help prevent rubbing. Your footwear should be fitted around the orthosis. Lace-up shoes or those with Velcro fastenings are recommended for use with AFOs because they're easy to adjust. Shoes with a removable inlay are also useful because they provide extra room. High-heeled shoes should be avoided. It's important to break your orthosis in slowly. Once broken in, wear it as much as possible while walking because it will help you walk more efficiently and keep you stable. Electrical nerve stimulation In some cases, an electrical stimulation device, similar to a TENS machine, can be used to improve walking ability. It can help you walk faster, with less effort and more confidence. Two self-adhesive electrode patches are placed on the skin. One is placed close to the nerve supplying the muscle and the other over the centre of the muscle. Leads connect the electrodes to a battery-operated stimulator, which is the size of a pack of cards and is worn on a belt or kept in a pocket. The stimulator produces electrical impulses that stimulate the nerves to contract (shorten) the affected muscles. The stimulator is triggered by a sensor in the shoe and is activated every time your heel leaves the ground as you walk. If your GP or consultant thinks you'll benefit from using an electrical stimulation device, you'll be referred to an orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon for an assessment. You may then be referred to a specialist unit to try the device and assess its suitabilty. For long-term use, it may be possible to have an operation to implant the electrodes under your skin. The procedure involves positioning the electrodes over the affected nerve while you're under general anaesthetic. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advises that electrical stimulation can be used to treat people with foot drop caused by damage to the brain or spinal cord, provided: the person understands what's involved and agrees to the treatment the results of the procedure are closely monitored Read the NICE guidance about Functional electrical stimulation for drop foot of central neurological origin. Surgery Surgery may be an option in severe or long-term cases of foot drop that have caused permanent movement loss from muscle paralysis. The procedure usually involves transferring a tendon from the stronger leg muscles to the muscle that should be pulling your ankle upwards. Another type of surgery involves fusing the foot or ankle bones to help stabilise the ankle. Speak to your GP or orthopaedic foot and ankle specialist if you're thinking about having surgery for foot drop. They'll be able to give you more information about the available procedures and any associated pros and cons.

Many conditions that cause foot pain can be managed yourself at home, but you should see your GP if you're concerned about any severe or persistent pain in your feet. Common causes of foot pain Common causes of foot pain include: sprains and strains gout verrucas blisters, corns and calluses bunions ingrowing toenails plantar fasciitis (heel pain) Morton's neuroma metatarsalgia arthritis Achilles tendon injuries oedema  embedded objects diabetic foot problems broken or cracked bones (fractures) Click on these links for more information about these conditions. Sprains and strains Sprains and strains are very common injuries that affect muscles and ligaments (strong bands of tissue around joints that connect one bone to another). They often occur if you change direction or speed suddenly, fall and land awkwardly, or collide with an object or person, such as when playing sports. A sprain means one or more of your ligaments have stretched, twisted or torn. A strain means muscle fibres have stretched or torn. As well as pain, a sprain or strain can cause swelling, bruising and tenderness, and may result in you being unable to put weight on your foot. Most sprains and strains can be managed at home using PRICE therapy (protection, rest, ice, compression and elevation) and painkillers. Read more about treating sprains and strains. Gout Gout is a type of arthritis caused by a build-up of uric acid (a waste product) in your joints. It causes sudden bouts of severe pain, redness, swelling and warmth in affected joints, even when you're resting. These attacks usually last a few days at a time and most often affect the big toe joint. It can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between gout and a severely inflamed bunion (see below). The pain caused by gout can usually be treated using ice packs and by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) painkillers. You may also need additional treatment to prevent further episodes. Read more about treating gout. Verrucas Verrucas are small growths that usually develop on the soles of the feet. They can be painful if you put weight on them when you stand up or walk. Verrucas are fairly easy to identify. They look like small, flat white circles of skin that often have black dots in the centre. Most verrucas will often eventually clear up by themselves, but this can take a long time. There are over-the-counter verruca creams, gels and plasters that may help. Read more about treating verrucas.  Blisters, corns and calluses Poorly-fitting shoes that rub on the feet can damage the skin and may cause:  blisters \u2013 small pockets of fluid that form in the upper layers of the skin corns \u2013 small circles of thick skin calluses \u2013 hard, rough areas of skin that are often yellowish in colour These conditions can all result in pain and discomfort when you walk. Most blisters heal naturally in a few days and don't require medical attention. Wearing comfortable, well-fitting shoes can help stop them returning. Read more about treating blisters and preventing blisters. Corns and calluses don't necessarily improve on their own and you may need to see a podiatrist or chiropodist, who can advise you about appropriate treatment. Read more about treating corns and calluses. Bunions A bunion is a bony swelling at the base of the big toe that can be painful when wearing shoes and make walking difficult. Bunions are a common foot problem, particularly in women. The big toe points towards the other toes and the big toe joint sticks out, forming a bony lump. Bunions can get worse if they're left untreated, so it's best to see a GP for advice. Non-surgical treatments are usually tried first, including wearing comfortable and wide shoes, orthotics (insoles), painkillers and bunion pads. Corrective surgery may sometimes be necessary. Read more about treating bunions. Ingrowing toenails Ingrowing toenails occur when the sides of the toenail grow into the surrounding skin. The toenail pierces the skin, which can become red, swollen and tender. It can also be painful if pressure is placed on the toe or the toe becomes infected. Cutting your toenails straight across and gently pushing the skin away from the nail using a cotton bud may help improve an ingrowing toenail. In some cases, a procedure to remove part or all of the affected nail may be necessary. Plantar fasciitis Plantar fasciitis is the result of damage to the tough band of tissue (fascia) that runs under the sole of the foot, which causes pain in the heel. It most commonly affects people aged 40 to 60 who are overweight or on their feet for long periods of time. The pain tends to develop gradually over time and is at its worst when you wake up in the morning and at the end of the day. Resting your heel, regular stretching, applying ice packs, taking painkillers and wearing well-fitted, supportive shoes can often help relieve the pain. In a small number of cases, other treatments such as physiotherapy or injections may be necessary. Rarely, surgery may be required. Read more about treating plantar fasciitis. Morton's neuroma Morton's neuroma is a condition that affects the nerves between the toes. Fibrous tissue develops around the nerve, which becomes irritated and compressed. This causes severe burning pain on the ball of the foot and at the base of the toes. Morton's neuroma can occur on one foot or both feet. It usually affects the nerve between the third and fourth toes, but sometimes the second and third toes are affected. If you have Morton's neuroma, it may help to wear shoes with more room for the toes. You can also take painkillers or have steroid injections to help ease the pain. If these treatments don't work, surgery may be needed. Metatarsalgia Metatarsalgia is the term for pain that occurs in the front section of the foot. It's is often described as a burning or aching pain that ranges from mild to severe and gets worse when walking. It can affect one or several toes near the ball of your foot, or sometimes the entire foot. Anything that puts extra strain or pressure on the ball of your foot can bring on the pain \u2013 for example, wearing tight-fitting shoes for a long period of time, high impact sports, or being overweight. Older people are more susceptible to metatarsalgia.  Most cases of metatarsalgia can be managed using PRICE therapy (protection, rest, ice, compression and elevation), painkillers, changing your footwear and using shock-absorbing insoles. In rare cases, surgery may be required to repair underlying damage to the foot. Read more about treating metatarsalgia. Arthritis In older people, repeated episodes of foot pain and stiffness can indicate a sudden worsening of osteoarthritis, which is the most common type of arthritis in the UK. This long-term condition caused by wear and tear results in swelling of the tissues in and around the joints, including the big toe and heel joints. Treatments include wearing suitable footwear to reduce the strain on your joints, painkillers, anti-inflammatory medication, physiotherapy and surgery in some cases. Read more about treating osteoarthritis. Less commonly, foot pain can be caused by rheumatoid arthritis, which is a type of arthritis caused by the immune system attacking the joints and causing the joint tissues to become inflamed. It almost always affects other joints too, so foot pain will probably not be your only symptom. The main treatments include medication to relieve symptoms and slow the progress of the condition, physiotherapy, and occasionally surgery. Read more about treating rheumatoid arthritis. Achilles tendon injuries Pain and stiffness along the back of your heel could be a sign of damage to your Achilles tendon. This is known as Achilles tendinopathy. The pain can often be relieved with rest, ice packs and painkillers at home, although it may take several months to resolve completely. If you experience sudden and severe pain in your heel, which may have been accompanied by a \"popping\" or \"snapping\" sound, you may have ruptured (torn) your Achilles tendon. You should seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you have ruptured your Achilles tendon. Often this will be treated with immobilisation (wearing a plaster cast or plastic boot) for several weeks. Surgery may sometimes be required to repair the tear. Read more about treating tendon injuries. Oedema If your whole foot is painful, heavy and swollen, it may be a sign of oedema. This is a build-up of fluid (mainly water) in the body's tissues, causing swelling to occur in the affected area. Oedema will usually affect your whole lower leg as well. See your GP, or if the pain and swelling is severe, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. An object embedded in your foot Foot pain can sometimes be caused by an object embedded in the foot. It may therefore be worth considering whether you have stepped on something sharp with bare feet and examining your foot for a wound. If a small object, such as a splinter or thorn, is lodged in your skin, it's usually safe to remove it yourself. Wash your hands and clean the area first, and use tweezers if they help. Your pain should start to improve once the object has been removed. If the object is more deeply embedded, don't try to remove it yourself. Seek medical help as soon as possible. Diabetic foot problems People with diabetes can experience a number of potentially serious problems affecting their feet, some of which can be very painful. This is because the condition can damage nerves and blood vessels in your feet. Foot problems that can affect people with diabetes include: nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy), which can cause numbness and burning, stabbing or shooting pains in your feet poor circulation (ischaemia), which can cause your feet to become painful, cold, red and swollen skin ulcers \u2013 painful sores that take a very long time to heal skin infections \u2013 ulcers that become red and swollen, and may produce a foul-smelling odour and green discharge Contact your GP or diabetes care team immediately if you have diabetes and think you have developed a problem with one or both of your feet. Read more about feet and diabetes. A broken or cracked bone (fracture) A broken or cracked (fractured) bone in your foot can occur suddenly after a severe injury, or gradually over time as a result of doing lots of high-impact sports (such as long-distance running). Occasionally they can occur as a result of osteoporosis (weakened bones). Any bone in and around the foot can be affected, including the: bones in the middle of your feet (such as the metatarsals) heel toes \u2013 read more about a broken toe ankle \u2013 read more about a broken ankle bones of the lower leg \u2013 read more about a broken leg The affected area will be very painful and tender to touch, and the skin may be bruised. You should stop all activity immediately and avoid putting weight on your foot until you see a doctor.

Phimosis is normal in babies and toddlers, but in older children it may be the result of a skin condition that has caused scarring. It isn't usually a problem unless it causes symptoms. Immediate treatment is needed in cases where phimosis causes problems such as difficulty urinating. Normal development Most uncircumcised baby boys have a foreskin that won't pull back (retract) because it's still attached to the glans. This is perfectly normal for about the first two to six years. By around the age of two, the foreskin should start to separate naturally from the glans. The foreskin of some boys can take longer to separate, but this doesn't mean there's a problem \u2013 it will just detach at a later stage. Never try to force your child's foreskin back before it's ready because it may be painful and damage the foreskin. When phimosis is a problem Phimosis isn't usually a problem unless it causes symptoms such as redness, soreness or swelling. If your child's glans is sore and inflamed they may have balanitis (inflammation of the head of the penis). There may also be a thick discharge underneath the foreskin. If both the glans and foreskin are inflamed it's known as balanoposthitis. Take your child to see your GP if they have these type of symptoms. Your GP will be able to recommend appropriate treatment. Most cases of balanitis can be easily managed using a combination of good hygiene, creams or ointments, and avoiding substances that irritate the penis. Read more about treating balanitis. Balanoposthitis can also sometimes be treated by following simple hygiene measures, such as keeping the penis clean by regularly washing it with water and a mild soap or moisturiser. Urine can irritate the glans if it's retained for long periods under the foreskin, so if possible you should withdraw the foreskin to wash the glans. If balanoposthitis is caused by a fungal or bacterial infection, an antifungal cream or a course of antibiotics may be needed. In adults, phimosis can occasionally be associated with sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It can also be caused by a number of different skin conditions including: eczema \u2013 a long-term condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked psoriasis \u2013 a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales lichen planus \u2013 a non-infectious itchy rash that can affect many areas of the body lichen sclerosus \u2013 a scarring condition of the foreskin (and sometimes glans) that's probably caused by urinary irritation in susceptible men and boys Topical steroids (a cream, gel or ointment that contains corticosteroids) are sometimes prescribed to treat a tight foreskin. They can help soften the skin of the foreskin, making it easier to retract. Phimosis can cause pain, skin splitting, or a lack of sensation during sex. Using a condom and lubricants while having sex may make your penis more comfortable. When surgery may be needed Surgery may be needed if a child or adult has severe or persistent balanitis or balanoposthitis that causes their foreskin to be painfully tight. Circumcision (surgically removing part or all of the foreskin) may be considered if other treatments have failed, but it carries risks such as bleeding and infection. Therefore, it's usually only recommended as a last resort, although it can sometimes be the best and only treatment option.  Alternatively, surgery to release the adhesions (areas where the foreskin is stuck to the glans) may be possible. This will preserve the foreskin but may not always prevent the problem recurring. Paraphimosis Paraphimosis is where the foreskin can't be returned to its original position after being retracted. It causes the glans to become painful and swollen and requires emergency medical treatment to avoid serious complications, such as increased pain, swelling and restricted blood flow to the penis. It may be possible to reduce the pain and inflammation by applying a local anaesthetic gel to the penis and pressing on the glans while pushing the foreskin forward. In difficult cases, it may be necessary to make a small slit in the foreskin to help relieve the pressure. In severe cases of paraphimosis, circumcision may be recommended. In very severe cases, a lack of blood flow to the penis can cause tissue death (gangrene) and surgical removal of the penis may be necessary. Penis hygiene It's important to clean your penis regularly to avoid problems developing. You should: gently wash your penis with warm water each day while having a bath or showering gently pull back your foreskin (if you have one) and wash underneath; don't pull back the foreskin of a baby or young boy because it could be painful and cause harm use a mild or non-perfumed soap (if you choose to use soap) to reduce the risk of skin irritation avoid using talc and deodorants on your penis because they may cause irritation Circumcised men should also regularly clean their penis with warm water and a mild soap (if you choose to use soap).

It could be something that happened seconds or minutes ago, or a memorable event that occurred in the past. The loss of memory may have started suddenly, or it may have been getting worse over the last year or so. It's normal to become a bit forgetful as you get older. However, memory loss could be a symptom of something more serious and should be checked by a GP. Memory loss can be distressing for the person affected, and their family. Relatives may fear the worst and assume it's caused by dementia, but this often isn't the case. The following information will tell you: what to do if you're worried about memory loss how to tell if it could be caused by dementia the most common causes of memory loss (but don't rely on this to self-diagnose a condition) how to cope with a poor memory What to do if you're worried about memory loss See your GP if you're worried because you or someone you care for has lost their memory. They'll do an initial assessment and ask questions about symptoms, family history and lifestyle. They may also arrange a blood test. Memory loss has a wide range of possible causes, depending on the type of memory loss. Doctors classify memories as either: immediate memories \u2013 such as sounds, which are only stored for a few seconds short-term or recent memories \u2013 such as telephone numbers, which stay in your memory for 15 to 20 seconds; the brain can store about seven chunks of short-term information at any time long-term or remote memories \u2013 more permanent memories, which have been reinforced because you've repeatedly gone over them in your mind If your GP thinks you or your relative needs an assessment for dementia, or that there may be another more serious underlying condition, such as brain damage, they'll refer you to a specialist. Could memory loss be dementia? If you're reading this because you think your memory problems may be a sign of dementia, rest assured that they probably aren't. A person with dementia won't usually be aware of their memory loss, or may deny it. Your memory loss is likely to be caused by something much more common and treatable, such as depression. You may be worried that someone you care for has dementia. However, bear in mind around 40% of people over 65 have some type of memory problem, and only 15% will develop dementia each year. If your instincts are correct, their denial or lack of awareness of their memory loss can make it difficult to convince them to see a GP. This fact sheet includes information about how to persuade your relative to see a doctor (PDF, 848kb). Signs that someone has dementia As a general guide: Dementia usually occurs in people over the age of 65. The memory loss doesn't happen suddenly, but gets gradually worse over time. Someone with dementia will struggle to remember immediate or recent events, but can still recall events that happened a long time ago. This means that if their long-term memory is affected, it probably isn't dementia. Read more about the symptoms of dementia. Common causes of memory loss GPs often find that people who see them about memory loss are most likely to have: anxiety stress depression Their memory loss is a result of poor concentration and not noticing things in the first place because of a lack of interest. Sleeping problems often make the memory loss worse. Your GP may suggest trying antidepressants. If you have depression or anxiety, your memory problems should get better as the depression or anxiety improves. An elderly person with memory loss is likely to have depression if they also experience changes in behaviour, such as hoarding or being bad tempered. Other common causes of memory loss are: a head injury \u2013 for example, after a car accident a stroke \u2013 this cuts off some of the blood supply to the brain and causes brain tissue to die These will cause sudden memory loss, where you either forget events that happened before the trauma (retrograde amnesia), or you forget everything that happened after the trauma (anterograde amnesia).  Less common causes of memory loss Less commonly, memory loss can be caused by: an underactive thyroid \u2013 where your thyroid gland (found in the neck) doesn't produce enough hormones certain types of medication, such as sedatives and some treatments for Parkinson's disease long-term alcohol misuse bleeding in the brain (subarachnoid haemorrhage) vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency \u2013 for example, as the result of a digestive problem transient global amnesia \u2013 problems with blood flow to part of the brain, which causes sudden episodes of memory loss that a person can't recall afterwards  psychogenic amnesia \u2013 a stressful or traumatic event that causes someone to block out the memory, leaving them unable to remember important information a brain tumour Click on the links above for more information about these conditions. Tips for coping with a poor memory Keep everyday items, such as car keys, in the same place and try to do things in the same order each time. Write information down, and keep paper and a pencil near the phone. Keep a diary at home as well as at work to remind you to do daily tasks. Use an alarm to help you remember to do something in the future, such as taking something out of the oven. Repeat important information you need to remember back to someone.

How do I know if my ankle is broken? If you injure your ankle, the following can be signs of a fracture: pain and tenderness \u2013 particularly in the bones around the ankle being unable to walk or put any weight on the ankle swelling and significant bruising a 'crack' sound during the injury the ankle being a funny shape (dislocated) bone poking out of the skin (open or compound fracture) Because of the shock and pain of breaking your ankle, you may also feel faint, dizzy or sick. If the injury is not severe it can be difficult to tell if your ankle is broken or just sprained. An X-ray is needed to confirm whether the ankle is broken and help determine the most appropriate treatment. What you should do If you think you may have broken your ankle, go to your nearest accident & emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible. If it feels like only a minor fracture and it is not an emergency, it may be more appropriate to go to a minor injuries unit. Try to avoid putting any weight on the ankle. Ask a friend or relative to drive you to hospital and support your weight as you walk on your other foot. Raising the leg and applying an ice pack (try a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) can help reduce pain and swelling while you make your way to hospital. You can also take over-the-counter painkillers, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, to help relieve the pain. Call 999 for an ambulance if the ankle looks like it might be dislocated, or you can see bones poking through the skin. How a broken ankle is treated If your ankle is dislocated or the bones are badly misaligned (displaced) the doctor or paramedic may decide to manipulate them back into place (reduction). This is to avoid potential problems with the blood and nerve supply to the foot. A splint will then usually be applied to protect your ankle and keep the bones in the correct position while you are transferred to an accident and emergency department. You will be given strong painkillers or sedation to ensure your comfort during this procedure. At the hospital, your doctor will then decide whether you need surgery or if you just need a cast to support your ankle as it heals naturally. An X-ray is needed to confirm the fracture and to help decide on the appropriate treatment. Cast Most ankle fractures will need to be put in a plaster cast or splint for around six weeks. You'll usually be advised not to put any weight on the broken ankle for at least the first few weeks so you will need to use crutches to support yourself. This will depend on your fracture and in some cases you will be advised to walk on the ankle. Over the next few weeks, you'll normally be asked to attend follow-up appointments with an orthopaedic surgeon (a specialist in problems affecting the bones and joints) at a fracture clinic. Your doctor can advise you about things you can do to help your ankle heal and further X-rays may be carried out to make sure it's healing correctly. They may also replace your original plaster cast with a lighter one or a special removable boot as you recover. Surgery More severe fractures often require surgery to realign the bones and fix them in position. This is usually carried out under a general anaesthetic (where you are put to sleep). The surgeon makes cuts in the skin near the ankle and the bones are put back into position. A combination of plates, screws and wires may be used to hold the bones together, and the wound is closed using stitches. The metalwork is not normally removed later on unless it becomes a problem. Most people will stay in hospital for one or two days after surgery. A plaster cast will be placed over the ankle to protect it before you go home. Recovering It takes about six to 12 weeks for a broken ankle to heal, but it may take longer to regain full movement and return to all of your normal activities. Swelling can sometimes take a few years to improve. Ask friends or family to go shopping for you, as you won't be able to do this yourself. You will, however, be able to move around your home on crutches and manage stairs. How soon you can return to work depends on how badly you fractured your ankle and the type of work you do, but you will probably be off for at least four to six weeks. Follow your doctor or surgeon's advice on elevating, moving and resting the ankle, and make sure you attend all follow-up appointments after you have been discharged from hospital. If necessary, you may be referred to a physiotherapist who can show you exercises that may help speed up your recovery. Read more about caring for a plaster cast. When to see your GP Check the ankle regularly and see your GP if: the pain gets worse or is not relieved by ordinary painkillers \u2013 your GP may be able to prescribe a stronger painkiller you develop any other medical problems or want advice about returning to work you are planning on flying after ankle surgery \u2013 having recent surgery can increase your risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and your GP can advise you whether it's safe to fly When to go back to hospital Go back to your nearest A&E department if: you have pins and needles or numbness in your toes the skin around your ankle or foot has turned blue the ankle becomes very swollen you\u2019re having problems with your plaster cast there is a foul-smelling discharge from a surgical wound on your ankle These signs may indicate an infection or a problem with the nerves or blood supply to the ankle.

Doctors refer to all breaks or cracks in bones as fractures. Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if you think you or your child has broken a bone. If the injury is severe, dial 999 for an ambulance. If it feels like only a minor fracture and it is not an emergency, it may be more appropriate to go to a minor injuries unit. How can I tell if the arm or wrist is broken? A broken arm or wrist bone will be extremely painful and there may also be: swelling or tenderness around the injured area bleeding, if the bone has damaged the tissue and skin These symptoms may also occur if your arm or wrist is sprained rather than broken (read about sprains and strains). An X-ray in hospital is the only way to confirm whether or not the bone is broken. If it's a clean break, you may have heard a snap or a grinding noise during the accident. The bone can break straight across, diagonally, or in a spiral pattern. In severe cases, the bone may break into many pieces (comminuted), stick out at an angle or poke through the skin (open or compound fracture). What you can do It's important not to eat or drink anything if you think you've broken your arm because you may need a general anaesthetic so that the bone can be realigned. Before reaching hospital, a sling may help stabilise the arm (this goes under the arm and around the neck). Avoid trying to straighten the arm. Applying an ice pack, such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel, to the injured area can help reduce pain and swelling. If your child has injured their arm or wrist, try to get someone else to drive so you can support and comfort them. How a broken arm or wrist is treated A broken arm or wrist is usually treated in a hospital accident and emergency department. The treatment differs depending on the severity of the injury. A doctor will give you or your child painkillers and fix a splint to the arm to secure it in position and prevent further damage. An X-ray of the arm will then be taken to see what kind of fracture it is. Even hairline fractures show faintly on X-ray. A simple fracture, where the bone remains aligned, can be treated by applying a plaster cast. This holds the broken ends together so they can heal. You'll be given painkillers to take home and be told how to look after your cast. An appointment will be made to attend a fracture clinic so specialist orthopaedic doctors can take over the care of your fracture. With more severe arm or wrist fractures, the bones can become misaligned (displaced). If the bone isn't realigned (reduced), the bones won't heal well. Doctors use a technique called \"closed reduction\" to pull the bones back into position. Local or regional anaesthetic will be used to numb the arm (this is rarely used in children), or you'll be put to sleep using a general anaesthetic. If doctors are happy with the bones' new position, a plaster cast will be applied and you'll have regular follow-up appointments and X-rays. Certain fractures are best treated with surgery to realign and fix the broken bones. This includes displaced fractures, fractures involving a joint, and open fractures. Surgeons can fix bones with wires, plates, screws or rods. This is called open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Any metalwork isn't usually removed unless it becomes a problem. In rare cases, an external frame, known as an external fixator, is used to hold the broken bones in place. After most types of surgery, a plaster cast is applied to protect the repair. A sling may also be provided for comfort. You'll usually be able to go home within a day or two of having surgery. Recovering from a broken arm or wrist The plaster cast will need to stay on until the bone has healed. The length of time it will take to heal will depend on the type of fracture, whether it's damaged the surrounding tissues, and the person's age. For example, a young child who's cracked their wrist will need to wear a cast or removable splint for just two to three weeks. However, in older people, a wrist injury can take much longer to heal and stiffness is very common. A useful rule of thumb is that the time taken for the bone to regain full strength is usually the same as the time it takes for the fracture to heal. That is, if you\u2019ve been in plaster for six weeks, it will take six weeks to regain full strength. It's important not to get a plaster cast wet. Read more about how should I care for my plaster cast? for further information and advice. The orthopaedic doctors will decide when you can take the cast off and when you can return to work and normal activities. Your arm may be stiff and weak after being in a cast. Physiotherapy can help build strength in the arm muscles and restore full movement. However, it's rarely needed for children. The risk of re-breaking or cracking the bone after the plaster cast is removed is increased, particularly in children. Children should avoid using trampolines, bouncy castles, soft play areas and playing contact sports for a further two to three weeks to minimise this risk. Adults shouldn't drive while their arm is in a cast. Ask your doctor for advice about when you can drive again.

It usually happens after a fall or a blow to the shoulder. It takes about six to eight weeks to heal in adults, and three to six weeks in children. The collarbone, or clavicle, is a long slender bone that runs from the breastbone to each of the shoulders. You should be able to feel it running across the top of your chest, just below your neck. It is connected to the breastbone and shoulder blade via tough bands of tissue called ligaments. See your GP straight away if you've injured your collarbone. If your GP thinks it's fractured, they'll refer you to hospital for an X-ray to confirm the injury and have it treated with a sling and brace.  If you can't see your GP or if the injury is severe \u2013 for example, the bone is poking through the skin or the pain is unbearable \u2013 go straight to your nearest hospital accident and emergency (A&E) department. This page summarises the signs of a broken or cracked collarbone, and explains what you can do while you wait to see the doctor and how this injury is treated.  Signs of a broken collarbone A cracked or broken collarbone will be extremely painful. There may also be: swelling or tenderness around the injured area bruising to the skin bleeding if the bone has damaged the tissue and skin (this is rare) numbness or pins and needles if nerves in the arm are injured Your shoulder may be slumped downwards and forwards under the weight of the arm, as the broken collarbone is no longer providing support. You may have heard a snap or a grinding noise during the accident. In very severe cases, one end of the bone may poke through the skin. What you should do While you wait to see a doctor, stabilise the arm by using a towel as a sling (this goes under the forearm and then around the neck). Try to move the arm as little as possible. Take over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to reduce the pain \u2013 aspirin shouldn't be given to children aged under 16. Hold an ice pack to the injured area \u2013 try a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel. This can help reduce pain and swelling. Don't apply ice directly to the skin as it can burn. How a broken collarbone is treated Most broken collarbones are left to heal naturally using a simple triangular sling to support the arm and hold the bones together in their normal positions. The sling is usually applied in hospital after an X-ray has confirmed the collarbone is broken. You'll be given painkillers to relieve the pain.   Surgery under a general anaesthetic is only needed if the injury is severe \u2013 for example, the bone has broken through the skin \u2013 or if the bones have failed to line up and are overlapping significantly. Many different techniques have been used to repair the collarbone, but the most common is to fix the break with a plate and screws. If you need surgery to repair your broken collarbone, ask your surgeon to explain which technique they'll be using, and the advantages and disadvantages of this method. Being discharged You may need to stay in hospital overnight, depending on the extent of the injury. Before you're discharged, you may see a physiotherapist, who can show you some gentle arm and shoulder exercises to do at home with your arm out of its sling. These will help reduce stiffness, relieve some of the pain, and build up strength in your shoulder muscles. Follow-up You'll probably need to go back to the hospital outpatient department about one week later to make sure your collarbone is healing properly. See your GP if you have any concerns before this appointment. You should go back to the A&E department if you notice any weakness developing in your arm or hand, or if your pain suddenly becomes worse. How long does it take to heal? In adults, it usually takes about six to eight weeks for a broken collarbone to heal, although it can take longer. In children, it usually takes about three to six weeks to heal. However, it will take at least the same period again to restore full strength to your shoulder. While the fracture heals, a lump may develop along the collarbone. This is normal and often improves over the following months. Occasionally, the fracture doesn't heal (non-union) and you may need to have surgery. This should be discussed with your surgeon. Recovery advice You may find the following advice helpful while recovering from a broken collarbone: use extra pillows at night to keep yourself more upright if you find sleeping uncomfortable use ice packs and painkillers if pain and swelling continues while your arm is in a sling try to move your elbow, hand and fingers regularly as soon as it's comfortable to do so when you think the fracture has started to heal, try removing the sling for short periods at a time if it's not too painful avoid contact sports for at least 10 to 12 weeks after the injury \u2013 your doctor will tell you when you can go back to work and resume normal activities It's important to let your arm hang freely. Avoid resting your arms and elbows on chairs, tables, pillows or inside the sleeves of clothes until you've healed.

Doctors sometimes refer to hip fractures as proximal femoral fractures. The hip joints The hip joints attach your thigh bones (femurs) to your pelvis. Hip joints are ball-and-socket joints. The ball is the rounded top part of the femur. The socket is the cup-shaped part of the pelvic bone that the rounded end of the femur sits inside. A hip fracture is a crack or break in the top end (neck) of the femur, nearest the hip joint. It can either occur in the part of the femur inside the socket of the hip joint (intracapsular), or outside the socket (extracapsular). Symptoms of a hip fracture  Symptoms of a hip fracture include: not being able to lift, move or rotate (turn) your leg being unable to stand or put weight on your leg, although in some cases this is possible a shorter leg, or your leg turning outwards more on the injured side If you think you've fractured your hip, you'll need to go to hospital as soon as possible. Dial 999 to request an ambulance. Try not to move while you're waiting for the ambulance and make sure you keep warm. What causes hip fractures?  Hip fractures are often the result of a fall. Falls are very common in older people due to other health problems, such are reduced vision and mobility and balance problems. A fall can cause a hip fracture if a person has osteoporosis (weak and fragile bones). Some people find it hard to recover after a hip fracture, up to one in three people die within 12 months of fracturing their hip (although most deaths aren't caused by the fall itself but by pre-existing illnesses). This is why the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends a co-ordinated programme of care for people who've fractured a hip (see below). Treating a hip fracture Surgery is usually the only treatment option for hip fractures. NICE recommends that someone with a hip fracture should have surgery on the day they're admitted to hospital or the day after being admitted. In about half of all cases, a partial or complete hip replacement is needed. The rest require surgery to fix the fracture with plates and screws or rods. The type of surgery you have will depend on a number of factors, including: type of fracture (where on the femur it is) your age your level of mobility before the fracture the condition of the bone and joint \u2013 for example, whether you have arthritis Read more about treating a hip fracture. Recovering from hip surgery The aim after surgery is to speed up recovery to help regain your mobility. The day after surgery, you should have a physiotherapy assessment and be given a rehabilitation programme that includes realistic goals for you to achieve during your recovery. The aim is to help you regain your mobility and independence so that you can return home as soon as possible. Read more about your care after discharge from hospital. How long you'll need to stay in hospital will depend on your condition and mobility. After having a hip replacement, it may be possible for you to be discharged in three to five days. Evidence suggests that prompt surgery and a tailored rehabilitation programme that starts as soon as possible after surgery can significantly improve a person's life, reduce the length of their hospital stay and help them recover their mobility faster. Read more about recovering from a hip fracture. It may also be useful to read your guide to care and support \u2013 written not only for people with care and support needs, but their carers and relatives too. It includes information and advice on: transport and getting around with mobility issues rehabilitation or 'reablement' services choosing mobility equipment, wheelchairs and scooters  Complications of hip surgery Complications that can occur after a hip operation include: infection \u2013 occurs in about 1-3% of cases blood clots \u2013 can form in the deep veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis); they can be prevented using compression stockings, exercise and medication pressure ulcers \u2013 can develop on an area of skin that's under constant pressure due to being in a chair or bed for long periods Your surgeon will be able to discuss these and any other risks with you. Read more about the complications of a hip fracture. Preventing hip fractures It may be possible to prevent hip fractures by taking steps to prevent falls and by treating osteoporosis. You can reduce your risk of falling by: using walking aids, such as a walking stick assessing your home for hazards \u2013 such as loose carpeting \u2013 and making it safer using exercises to improve your balance Read more about preventing falls and preventing hip fractures. Major public health issue Hip fractures are a major public health issue due to an ever increasing ageing population (80 is the average age of a person who has a hip fracture). Around 70,000-75,000 hip fractures occur in the UK each year. The annual cost for all hip fractures in the UK, including medical and social care, is about £2 billion. Hip fractures are more common in women due to the higher incidence of osteoporosis (weak and fragile bones) in women.

Most broken noses heal naturally in two to three weeks and they can often be managed at home. The swelling should go down within a week, and the bruising should disappear after two weeks. This page describes the signs of a broken nose and gives advice on what to do. How do I know if I\u2019ve broken my nose? A broken nose will be painful, swollen and red. Other typical symptoms include: bruising around the eyes (black eyes) a nosebleed tenderness when you touch the nose a crunching or crackling sound when you touch the nose the nose looking deformed difficulty breathing out of the nose, as if something is blocking it Many broken noses can be cared for at home and medical treatment isn't always necessary, especially if the skin and septum (wall between the nostrils) are still intact. Caring for your nose at home You can often manage your broken nose at home by following the advice below: Hold an ice pack (frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel will also work) to the nose for 10-15 minutes every few hours for the first couple of days. If your nose is bleeding, pinch the soft part of your nose just above your nostrils for 10-15 minutes to stop the bleeding. Lean your head forward to prevent blood trickling down your throat. Take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve the pain. Prop your head up in bed by sleeping on a few pillows to help reduce the swelling. If your nose looks deformed, don't attempt to straighten it yourself. See your GP for advice. If your nose looks straight and your symptoms start to improve after a few days, you may not need to seek medical advice. In these cases, you should avoid wearing glasses until the swelling has gone down and you should try not to pick or blow your nose until it's healed. Avoid strenuous activities for at least two weeks and avoid contact sports for at least six weeks. When to see your GP Contact your GP if: the pain gets worse or is not relieved by ordinary painkillers (your GP may be able to prescribe a stronger painkiller) the swelling doesn't go down after a few days the swelling has gone down, but you still find it difficult to breathe through your nose your nose looks crooked you have nosebleeds that keep coming and going you have a high temperature (fever) It's important not to delay seeing your GP for too long if you have any concerns. If further treatment is necessary, this is most successful if carried out within a week or two of the injury. Find a GP near you. When to go to hospital Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if: you have a nosebleed that won't stop you have an open wound over your nose clear fluid is trickling from your nose (this could indicate a serious head injury) you have a severe headache you have neck pain or a stiff neck \u2013 especially if there is numbness or tingling in your arms you have problems with your vision, such as blurred or double vision you have other symptoms of a severe head injury you can feel or see a swelling (a blood clot) in your septum \u2013 this needs to be drained as soon as possible Find your nearest A&E department. Treatment for a severely broken nose If your nose is crooked or the skin is broken, you'll probably need to be assessed and treated in hospital. A doctor may be able to realign your nose using special instruments under general anaesthetic (where you\u2019re asleep) or sometimes a local anaesthetic (where the nose is numbed). You may need to return after a few days when the swelling has gone down before this can be carried out, but it should ideally be done within 14 days of the injury. If necessary, it may be possible to have a procedure to improve the appearance of your nose at a later stage, but this is generally more difficult and less successful than early treatment. Any broken skin will need to be closed with stitches or adhesive strips. If your nose is bleeding continuously, a doctor may pack your nose with a soft gauze pad to stop it. This will be removed by your doctor in a few days. Your doctor will let you know about any activities you need to avoid while you recover and whether you need to see a specialist for a follow-up appointment to check that the bones are healing in the correct position. Domestic abuse: getting help A broken nose usually results from a hard blow to the face, so it's sometimes a suspicious injury. If you're worried because you think someone may be a victim of abuse, offer your support and encourage them to talk. If you're a victim of abuse yourself, you can talk to your doctor or call the 24-hour National Domestic Violence Helpline on 0808 2000 247.

They can be very painful, but will normally improve within about three to six weeks. If you think you've injured your ribs, you'll often be able to look after yourself at home. Ribs can't be easily splinted or supported like other bones, so they're usually left to heal naturally. Broken and bruised ribs are generally treated in the same way, so it's not usually necessary to have an X-ray to determine what your exact injury is. You generally only need to seek medical advice if things get worse or don't improve, or if you were injured during a serious accident. See When to see a doctor, below, for more information. How can I tell if I've injured my ribs? A broken or bruised rib will feel very painful, particularly when you breathe in. You may feel you can only take shallow breaths, but it's important you try to breathe normally to help clear mucus from your lungs and prevent chest infections. You may also have some swelling or tenderness in your chest and bruising to the skin. Caring for your injury at home In most cases, you can take care of broken or bruised ribs at home. While your injury heals, pain relief is very important, as it will hurt every time you breathe in or cough. Taking shallow breaths and not coughing to avoid pain will only put you at risk of a chest infection. You can look after yourself by: regularly taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen (aspirin shouldn't be given to children aged under 16) \u2013 follow the dosage instructions on the packet holding an ice pack to your chest regularly during the first few days to reduce the pain and swelling \u2013 a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel will also work resting periodically \u2013 take time off work if you need to, especially if your work involves physical labour or the pain is severe keeping mobile between rest periods \u2013 walking around and moving your shoulders occasionally can help with your breathing and help clear any mucus from your lungs holding a pillow against your chest if you need to cough carrying out breathing exercises \u2013 take 10 slow, deep breaths every hour, letting your lungs inflate fully each time, to help keep your lungs clear Don't wrap a bandage tightly around your chest, as this will stop your lungs expanding properly. Try to avoid lying down or staying still for long periods. It may help to sleep more upright for the first few nights. Avoid straining and lifting heavy objects until you're feeling better, as you may injure yourself further and take longer to recover. If you smoke, stopping may also help your recovery. Get help to stop smoking. When to see a doctor See your GP if your pain hasn't started to improve within a few weeks. They can prescribe stronger painkillers if necessary and refer you to hospital if they feel you need further treatment. Seek medical help immediately if you develop any signs of a more serious problem, such as: increasing shortness of breath increasing chest pain pain in your tummy or shoulder coughing up blood  coughing up yellow or green mucus a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above The above symptoms may indicate a chest infection or may mean a broken rib has damaged your lung, causing the lung to collapse (pneumothorax) or injuring another organ, such as the liver or spleen. Go straight to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department for an assessment if your injury was the result of a serious accident, such as a vehicle collision.

It usually takes four to six weeks to heal, although severe injuries may take longer. A break or a crack in a bone is also known as a fracture. This advice is about the care of a toe following an injury. If you're not sure whether the toe is broken or just badly sprained, don't worry \u2013 in most cases, a painful and swollen toe caused by an injury should be cared for at home, regardless of whether or not it's broken. Learn more about sprains and strains. If you have a painful swollen toe but no injury, see your GP, especially if you have diabetes. How do I know if I\u2019ve broken my toe? A broken toe will be painful, swollen and red. There may be bruising of the skin around the area and sometimes a collection of blood beneath the toenail. You'll find it difficult to walk and wearing a shoe will be painful. If the break is severe, the toe may stick out at an angle. Most broken toes can be cared for at home and medical treatment may not be necessary. When to see your GP Check the toe every day and call your GP if: the pain gets worse or isn't relieved by ordinary painkillers \u2013 your GP may be able to prescribe a stronger painkiller the swelling or discolouration doesn\u2019t improve after a few days you have a wound near the injured toe, which will need cleansing to prevent infection When to go to hospital Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if: your toes are cold and numb or tingling (you may have damaged the nerves) the skin on your toe has turned blue or grey you've severely injured the toe \u2013 for example, if the toe is left bent at an angle or has an open wound Caring for your broken toe at home The following tips can be used to care for a broken toe at home. For little toes, put a piece of cotton wool or gauze between your injured toe and the one next to it and tape the two toes together with a plaster. The healthy toe will act as a splint. Using a shoe with a stiff sole or a surgical cast shoe will help your mobility. Keep your foot raised for as long as possible, for example by resting it on cushions. This will help reduce swelling and pain. Hold an ice pack (try frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) to the toe for 15-20 minutes every one to two hours for the first couple of days. Do not apply ice directly to the skin. Rest the toe by not walking or standing for too long, and not putting weight on the toe. Avoid any activities that might have caused the fracture until your toe is fully healed. You can begin normal activity once the swelling has gone down and you're able to comfortably wear a protective shoe. Take over-the-counter painkillers such as ibuprofen to relieve the pain, but don't give aspirin to a child under 16 years of age. Wear sturdy shoes that don't squash or bend the toe. Severe toe fractures If the break is severe and bone has broken away at an angle, this will need to be moved back into place using a technique called reduction. An X-ray of the toe will be required first. You will be given an injection of local anaesthetic to numb the area and doctors can often realign the bone through the skin without making any cuts. If a break is particularly severe, surgery may be needed so special pins or screws can be fixed to the broken bone to keep it in place while it heals. A broken big toe may need to be supported in a cast. If a lot of blood is trapped underneath the toenail and it's very painful, it will need to be drained through a small hole made in your nail, or the nail will need to be removed. You may be given crutches so you can walk without putting weight on the toe. A broken toe bone that has pierced the skin and damaged the surrounding tissue may become infected, so the wound will need to be cleansed regularly. You may be prescribed antibiotics and a tetanus jab may be considered if your vaccinations aren't up to date.

Doctors refer to all breaks or cracks in bones as fractures. Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if you think you or your child has broken a bone. If the injury is severe, dial 999 for an ambulance. If it feels like only a minor fracture and it is not an emergency, it may be more appropriate to go to a minor injuries unit. How can I tell if the arm or wrist is broken? A broken arm or wrist bone will be extremely painful and there may also be: swelling or tenderness around the injured area bleeding, if the bone has damaged the tissue and skin These symptoms may also occur if your arm or wrist is sprained rather than broken (read about sprains and strains). An X-ray in hospital is the only way to confirm whether or not the bone is broken. If it's a clean break, you may have heard a snap or a grinding noise during the accident. The bone can break straight across, diagonally, or in a spiral pattern. In severe cases, the bone may break into many pieces (comminuted), stick out at an angle or poke through the skin (open or compound fracture). What you can do It's important not to eat or drink anything if you think you've broken your arm because you may need a general anaesthetic so that the bone can be realigned. Before reaching hospital, a sling may help stabilise the arm (this goes under the arm and around the neck). Avoid trying to straighten the arm. Applying an ice pack, such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel, to the injured area can help reduce pain and swelling. If your child has injured their arm or wrist, try to get someone else to drive so you can support and comfort them. How a broken arm or wrist is treated A broken arm or wrist is usually treated in a hospital accident and emergency department. The treatment differs depending on the severity of the injury. A doctor will give you or your child painkillers and fix a splint to the arm to secure it in position and prevent further damage. An X-ray of the arm will then be taken to see what kind of fracture it is. Even hairline fractures show faintly on X-ray. A simple fracture, where the bone remains aligned, can be treated by applying a plaster cast. This holds the broken ends together so they can heal. You'll be given painkillers to take home and be told how to look after your cast. An appointment will be made to attend a fracture clinic so specialist orthopaedic doctors can take over the care of your fracture. With more severe arm or wrist fractures, the bones can become misaligned (displaced). If the bone isn't realigned (reduced), the bones won't heal well. Doctors use a technique called \"closed reduction\" to pull the bones back into position. Local or regional anaesthetic will be used to numb the arm (this is rarely used in children), or you'll be put to sleep using a general anaesthetic. If doctors are happy with the bones' new position, a plaster cast will be applied and you'll have regular follow-up appointments and X-rays. Certain fractures are best treated with surgery to realign and fix the broken bones. This includes displaced fractures, fractures involving a joint, and open fractures. Surgeons can fix bones with wires, plates, screws or rods. This is called open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Any metalwork isn't usually removed unless it becomes a problem. In rare cases, an external frame, known as an external fixator, is used to hold the broken bones in place. After most types of surgery, a plaster cast is applied to protect the repair. A sling may also be provided for comfort. You'll usually be able to go home within a day or two of having surgery. Recovering from a broken arm or wrist The plaster cast will need to stay on until the bone has healed. The length of time it will take to heal will depend on the type of fracture, whether it's damaged the surrounding tissues, and the person's age. For example, a young child who's cracked their wrist will need to wear a cast or removable splint for just two to three weeks. However, in older people, a wrist injury can take much longer to heal and stiffness is very common. A useful rule of thumb is that the time taken for the bone to regain full strength is usually the same as the time it takes for the fracture to heal. That is, if you\u2019ve been in plaster for six weeks, it will take six weeks to regain full strength. It's important not to get a plaster cast wet. Read more about how should I care for my plaster cast? for further information and advice. The orthopaedic doctors will decide when you can take the cast off and when you can return to work and normal activities. Your arm may be stiff and weak after being in a cast. Physiotherapy can help build strength in the arm muscles and restore full movement. However, it's rarely needed for children. The risk of re-breaking or cracking the bone after the plaster cast is removed is increased, particularly in children. Children should avoid using trampolines, bouncy castles, soft play areas and playing contact sports for a further two to three weeks to minimise this risk. Adults shouldn't drive while their arm is in a cast. Ask your doctor for advice about when you can drive again.

The most common injuries in people with osteoporosis are: wrist fractures hip fractures fractures of the spinal bones (vertebrae) However, they can also occur in other bones, such as in the arm or pelvis. Sometimes a cough or sneeze can cause a rib fracture or the partial collapse of one of the bones of the spine. Osteoporosis isn't usually painful until a fracture occurs, but spinal fractures are a common cause of long-term (chronic) pain. Although a fracture is the first sign of osteoporosis, some older people develop the characteristic stooped (bent forward) posture. It happens when the bones in the spine have fractured, making it difficult to support the weight of the body. Who's affected? Osteoporosis affects over three million people in the UK. More than 500,000 people receive hospital treatment for fragility fractures (fractures that occur from standing height or less) every year as a result of osteoporosis. Causes of osteoporosis Losing bone is a normal part of the ageing process, but some people lose bone density much faster than normal. This can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures. Women also lose bone rapidly in the first few years after the menopause (when monthly periods stop and the ovaries stop producing an egg). Women are more at risk of osteoporosis than men, particularly if the menopause begins early (before the age of 45). Many other factors can also increase the risk of developing osteoporosis, including: long-term use of high-dose oral corticosteroids other medical conditions \u2013 such as inflammatory conditions, hormone-related conditions, or malabsorption problems a family history of osteoporosis \u2013 particularly history of a hip fracture in a parent long-term use of certain medications which can affect bone strength or hormone levels having a low body mass index (BMI) heavy drinking and smoking Read more about the causes of osteoporosis. Diagnosing osteoporosis Risk assessment tools If your doctor suspects you have osteoporosis, they can make an assessment using an online programme, such as FRAX or Q-Fracture. These tools help to predict a person's risk of fracture between the ages of 40 and 90. The algorithms used give a 10-year probability of hip fracture and a 10-year probability of a major fracture in the spine, hip, shoulder or forearm. DEXA scan They may also refer you for a DEXA (DXA) scan to measure your bone mineral density. It's a short, painless procedure that takes about five minutes, depending on the part of the body being scanned. Your bone mineral density can be compared to the bone mineral density of a healthy young adult and someone who's the same age and sex as you. The difference is calculated as a standard deviation (SD) and is called a T score. Standard deviation is a measure of variability based on an average or expected value. A T score of: above -1 SD is normal  between -1 and -2.5 SD is defined as decreased bone mineral density compared with peak bone mass below -2.5 is defined as osteoporosis Osteopenia You may be diagnosed with osteopenia if bone density tests show you have decreased bone density, but not enough to be classed as osteoporosis. Your doctor may still recommend some of the treatments described below, depending on your results and your risk of fracture. Treating osteoporosis Treatment for osteoporosis is based on treating and preventing fractures, and using medication to strengthen bones. The decision about whether you need treatment depends on your risk of fracture. This will be based on a number of factors such as your age, sex and the results of your DEXA scan. If you need treatment, your doctor can suggest the safest and most effective treatment plan for you. Read more about how osteoporosis is treated. Preventing osteoporosis If you're at risk of developing osteoporosis, you should take steps to help keep your bones healthy. This may include: taking regular exercise healthy eating \u2013 including foods rich in calcium and vitamin D taking a daily supplement containing 10 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D making lifestyle changes \u2013 such as giving up smoking and reducing your alcohol consumption Read more about preventing osteoporosis. Living with osteoporosis If you're diagnosed with osteoporosis, there are steps you can take to reduce your chances of a fall, such as removing hazards from your home and having regular sight tests and hearing tests. To help you recover from a fracture, you can try using: hot and cold treatments such as warm baths and cold packs transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) \u2013 where a small battery-operated device is used to stimulate the nerves and reduce pain relaxation techniques Speak to your GP or nurse if you're worried about living with a long-term condition. They may be able to answer any questions you have. You may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or other people with the condition. The National Osteoporosis Society can put you in touch with local support groups, and they also have an online discussion forum. Read more about living with osteoporosis. At-risk groups Osteoporosis often affects women, particularly after the menopause (when monthly periods stop). However, it can also sometimes affect men, younger women and children. Other groups who are at risk of developing osteoporosis include: people who have been taking steroid medication for more than three months women who have had their ovaries removed people with a family history of osteoporosis people with an eating disorder, such as anorexia or bulimia  people who don't exercise regularly people who smoke or drink heavily Page last reviewed: 20\/06\/2016 Next review due: 20\/06\/2018 Share: Save: Print: Print this page Ratings How helpful is this page?

Any part of the body can be affected, but people with ataxia often have difficulties with: balance and walking speaking swallowing tasks that require a high degree of control, such as writing and eating vision  The exact symptoms and their severity vary depending on the type of ataxia a person has. Types of ataxia There are many different types of ataxia, which can be divided into three broad categories: acquired ataxia \u2013 where symptoms develop as the result of trauma, a stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), a brain tumour, nutritional deficiencies, or other problems that damage the brain or nervous system hereditary ataxia \u2013 where symptoms develop slowly over many years and are caused by faulty genes that a person inherits from their parents; the most common type is Friedreich's ataxia idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOCA) \u2013 where the brain is progressively damaged over time for reasons that are unclear Read more about the main types of ataxia. What causes ataxia? Ataxia usually results from damage to a part of the brain called the cerebellum, but it can also be caused by damage to other parts of the nervous system. This damage can be part of an underlying condition such as MS, or can be caused by a head injury, lack of oxygen to the brain, or long-term, excessive alcohol consumption. Hereditary ataxia is caused by a faulty gene passed on by family members, who may or may not be affected. Read more about the causes of ataxia. How ataxia is treated In most cases, there's no cure for ataxia and supportive treatment to control the symptoms is necessary. This may include: speech and language therapy to help with speech and swallowing problems physiotherapy to help with movement problems occupational therapy to help you cope with the day-to-day problems medication to control muscle, bladder, heart and eye problems In a few cases, it's possible to improve ataxia or stop it getting worse by treating the underlying cause. Read more about treating ataxia. Outlook The outlook for ataxia can vary considerably and largely depends on the type of ataxia you have. Some types may remain relatively stable or even improve with time, but most will get progressively worse over many years. Life expectancy is generally shorter than normal for people with hereditary ataxia, although some people can live well into their 50s, 60s or beyond. In more severe cases, the condition can be fatal in childhood or early adulthood. For acquired ataxia, the outlook depends on the underlying cause. Some cases may improve or stay the same, while other cases may get gradually worse over time and reduce life expectancy. Information about you If you have ataxia, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

The term \"dementia\" describes a loss of mental ability (cognitive impairment) that is more than would be expected with ageing. It's enough to affect day-to-day activities and gets progressively worse. Frontotemporal dementia tends to affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain (the front and sides) in particular. These parts of the brain are largely responsible for language and the ability to plan and organise, and are important in controlling behaviour. Frontotemporal dementia often starts at a younger age than usually seen in other types of dementia. Most cases are diagnosed in people aged 50-65, but it can also affect younger or older people. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of frontotemporal dementia vary at first, depending on the exact area of the brain affected. Generally, it causes slowly progressive problems with behaviour, language and thinking. It can profoundly alter a person's character \u2013 for example, they may become impulsive and much more outgoing, or uninterested and lacking initiative. Other typical symptoms include inappropriate behaviour in social situations and progressive difficulty with speech and language. Read more about the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia. What causes frontotemporal dementia?  There are several different causes of frontotemporal dementia, but they all involve a build-up of abnormal proteins in the brain. The abnormal proteins clump together and become toxic to the brain cells, which eventually kills them and causes the affected areas of the brain to shrink over time. It's not fully understood why these abnormal proteins build up, but there is often a genetic link. Up to 40% of people with frontotemporal dementia have a family history of the condition. Diagnosing frontotemporal dementia See your GP if you think you may have early symptoms of dementia. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest going along with them. Your GP can do some simple checks to see if there is a chance you could have dementia, and they can refer you to a specialist if necessary. The specialist will carry out a physical check-up and an assessment of your mental abilities. You may also have blood tests and brain scans. The results of these checks and tests will give your doctor a good idea as to whether your symptoms are caused by frontotemporal dementia, another type of dementia, or something else entirely. Read more about the diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. How frontotemporal dementia is managed There is currently no cure for frontotemporal dementia, nor any medications to slow it down. However, there are treatments and therapies that can help to reduce some of the symptoms. For example, antidepressants may be effective in controlling some of the behavioural problems. Support such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy help people adapt to lost functions. Dementia activities such as \"memory cafes\" and some psychological therapies can help with managing the symptoms. Read more about treating frontotemporal dementia.  Outlook Frontotemporal dementia gets progressively worse, usually over a number of years. People with the condition can become isolated and socially withdrawn as the illness progresses. They may not want to spend time in the company of others, or when in company, may lack empathy and concern for others, or behave in rude or insulting ways. Some lack the motivation to care for themselves and may need supervision and prompting. Home-based help is often needed, and some people will eventually need residential care in a nursing home. The average survival time after symptoms start is around eight years, although this can vary significantly. Many people with the condition live with it for 10 years or more. If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, you are not alone. The NHS, social services and voluntary organisations can provide advice and support to help you and your family.

Frostbite can affect any part of your body. However, the extremities, such as the hands, feet, ears, nose and lips are most likely to be affected. The symptoms of frostbite usually begin with the affected parts feeling cold and painful. If exposure to the cold continues, you may feel pins and needles before the area becomes numb, as the tissues freeze. When to seek medical attention If you think you or someone else may have frostbite, call your GP or NHS 111 for advice. If the symptoms are more severe or there are signs of hypothermia, such as constant shivering or fast breathing (hyperventilation), go immediately to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. A doctor will examine the affected area, check your vital signs and ask how the frostbite occurred. In some cases, you may need a follow-up appointment or referral to a specialist, because the full extent of a frostbite injury is often not apparent until a few days later. Treating frostbite A person with frostbite should be taken to a warm environment as soon as possible. This is to limit the effects of the injury and because it's also likely they'll have hypothermia. Don't put pressure on the affected area. The frostbitten area should be warmed up by a healthcare professional. This is usually done by immersing the affected area in warm (but not hot) water. A bath of water at 40-41C (104-105.8F) is recommended for re-warming. The re-warming process is often very painful and large amounts of painkillers may be needed. It's important not to re-warm the affected area if there's a chance of it freezing again, because this can lead to further tissue damage. In severe cases of frostbite, the loss of blood supply to the tissue may cause it to die (gangrene). A type of surgery called debridement may be needed to remove the dead tissue. In very severe cases, amputation may be needed. Read more about treating frostbite. What causes frostbite? The body responds to cold temperatures by narrowing the blood vessels. Blood flow to the extremities slows down, so that blood flow to the vital organs can be increased. As the blood is redirected away from the extremities, these parts of the body get colder, and fluid in the tissue can freeze into ice crystals. The ice crystals can cause severe cell and tissue damage in the affected area. The low blood flow also deprives the tissues of oxygen. If blood flow can't be restored, the tissue will eventually die. At-risk groups Certain groups of people are at greater risk of getting frostbite. They include: people who take part in winter and high-altitude sports, such as mountaineers and skiers anyone stranded in extreme cold weather conditions anyone who works outdoors in harsh conditions for long periods of time, such as soldiers, sailors and rescue workers homeless people the very young and very old, as their bodies are less able to regulate body temperature people with conditions that cause blood vessel damage or circulation problems, such as diabetes and Raynaud's phenomenon anyone taking medication that constricts the blood vessels, including beta-blockers (smoking can also constrict the blood vessels)  Many cases of frostbite occur in people who have taken drugs or drunk alcohol. Taking drugs or being drunk can lead to risky behaviour, not responding normally to cold, or falling asleep outside in cold weather. As you'd expect, cases of frostbite in England often rise during particularly cold winters. For example, during the very cold winter of 2010-11, there were 111 hospital admissions for frostbite. In most years, there are around 30-60 cases every winter. Preventing frostbite Almost all frostbite cases can be prevented by taking precautions during cold weather. Avoid unnecessary exposure to cold temperatures. The combination of wind and cold temperatures (wind chill) can also cause a rapid drop in temperature, so avoid going out when it's cold and windy, if possible.  It's also important to know what the early symptoms of frostbite are, particularly the tingling sensation of frostnip. Wear appropriate clothing that protects your extremities, such as: well-insulated boots and a thick pair of well-fitting socks mittens \u2013 they provide better protection against very cold weather than gloves a warm, weatherproof hat that covers your ears \u2013 it's important to protect your head from the cold multiple thin layers of warm, loose-fitting clothing \u2013 these act as insulation  You should also try to keep dry and remove any wet clothing as soon as you can.  If you're travelling during cold weather, plan for emergencies. For example, if you're driving in icy conditions, make sure you keep a warm blanket and some spare clothes in the boot of your car, in case you break down.  If you're travelling by foot, always let others know where you're going and what time you'll be back. Take a fully charged mobile phone with you, so you can call for help if you have an accident, such as a fall. Be careful when drinking alcohol during very cold weather. Drinking too much increases your risk of falling asleep in the cold (a common cause of frostbite). Alcohol also causes you to lose heat at a faster rate. Smoking also makes you more vulnerable to the effects of the cold, because nicotine can narrow your blood vessels. Complications of frostbite If some of your tissue dies, the dead tissue will no longer have a blood supply. This can make the affected body part very vulnerable to infection, because your body relies on white blood cells to ward off infections. People with frostbite are at risk of bacterial wound infections, such as tetanus. More seriously, this infection can spread into the blood (sepsis), which requires treatment with antibiotics. Both conditions require hospital admission.  Read more about treating tetanus and treating sepsis. Hypothermia Severe frostbite is often associated with hypothermia, which occurs when a person's body temperature drops below 35C (95F). Initial symptoms can include: constant shivering tiredness low energy cold or pale skin fast breathing (hyperventilation) Someone with severe hypothermia may be unconscious and have shallow breathing and a weak pulse.  Read more about how hypothermia is treated.

It's not usually serious, but can be unpleasant and difficult to treat. The infection develops slowly and causes the nail to become discoloured, thickened and distorted. Toenails are more frequently affected than the fingernails. The medical name for a fungal nail infection is onychomycosis. This page covers: Symptoms Causes Treatments Prevention Symptoms of a fungal nail infection A fungal nail infection may not cause any obvious symptoms at first. As it progresses, the infection can cause: discolouration of the nail \u2013 it may turn white, black, yellow or green thickening and distortion of the nail \u2013 it may become an unusual shape or texture and be difficult to trim pain or discomfort \u2013 particularly when using or placing pressure on the affected toe or finger brittle or crumbly nails \u2013 pieces may break off and come away completely Sometimes the skin nearby may also become infected and be itchy and cracked or red and swollen. Causes of fungal nail infections Most fungal nail infections occur as a result of the fungi that cause athlete's foot infecting the nails. These fungi often live harmlessly on your skin, but they can sometimes multiply and lead to infections. The fungi prefer warm, dark and moist places like the feet. You're more likely to get a fungal nail infection if you: don't keep your feet clean and dry wear shoes that cause your feet to get hot and sweaty walk around barefoot in places where fungal infections can spread easily, such as communal showers, locker rooms and gyms have damaged your nails have a weakened immune system have certain other health conditions, such as diabetes, psoriasis or peripheral arterial disease  Fungal nail infections can be spread to other people, so you should take steps to avoid this (see below) if you have an infection. Treatments for fungal nail infections Treatment isn't always needed for a mild fungal nail infection because it's unlikely to cause any further problems and you may feel it's not worth treating. Whether you decide to have treatment or not, you should still practise good foot hygiene (see below) to stop the infection getting worse or spreading to others. Speak to your GP or pharmacist if you're bothered by the appearance of the affected nail, or it's causing problems such as pain and discomfort. They'll probably recommend: antifungal tablets \u2013 tablets taken once or twice a day for several months antifungal nail paints \u2013 special paints applied directly to the nail over several months nail softening kits \u2013 where a paste is used to soften infected parts of the nail, before they're removed with a scraping device A procedure to remove the nail completely may be recommended in severe cases. Laser treatment, where a high-energy laser is used to destroy the fungus, is also an option. But this is only available privately and can be expensive. Read more about treating a fungal nail infection. Preventing fungal nail infections You can reduce your risk of developing a fungal nail infection by: keeping your hands and feet clean and dry wearing well-fitting shoes made of natural materials and clean cotton socks \u2013 these will allow your feet to \"breathe\" clipping your nails to keep them short \u2013 don't share clippers or scissors with other people not sharing towels and socks with other people, and ensure your towels are washed regularly not walking around barefoot in public pools, showers, and locker rooms \u2013 special shower shoes are available to protect your feet replacing old footwear that could be contaminated with fungi treating athlete's foot as soon as possible to avoid the infection spreading to your nails Nail salon equipment can sometimes be the source of fungal nail infections.
